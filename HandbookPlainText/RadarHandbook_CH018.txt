Keith Raney Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory 18.1 PERSPECTIVE Motivation.  Worldwide, the rate of investment in space-based radar (SBR) dur - ing the time the radars in this chapter were operating was on the order of one billion  dollars per year. Space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems capable of 1-m  resolution have become the norm, with systems under development or already launched  by at least seven countries. 
As expanded in the appropriate sections of this chapter,  the (range) measurement precision of surface height change is now on the order of  1 millimeter per year, as established by two different classes of Earth-observing SBRs  (SARs and radar altimeters). Several nations are sponsoring radars for exploration at  the Moon and beyond. SBR-related patent applications continue apace. 
In short, SBR  is an exciting, exacting, extensive, and expanding topic. Space-based radar systems face fundamental challenges. The permissible options  for the value of several parameters (such as pulse repetition frequency) are more  restricted for SBR than for airborne systems. 
Likewise, the hardware environment  imposes more rigorous constraints on implementation, and SBR systems do not enjoy  the luxuries of hands-on maintenance nor in-field parts replacement. However, the  payoff from radars in space more than compensates for these challenges, since space  offers a unique perspective for Earth observation and is an essential viewpoint for  lunar or planetary exploration. Covered and Omitted Topics. 
 This chapter introduces space-based remote  sensing radars. The focus is on Type II SBRs, as outlined in the previous edition of  this Handbook , including both Earth-orbiting and planetary systems. The material in  this chapter is designed to be reasonably complete at a survey level; the discussion  zooms in on selected case examples to illustrate application-specific implementa - tions or technological innovations. 
An outstanding early example is the Seasat satel - lite launched in 1978 (Figure 18.1), which (as its name suggests) was designed for  oceanic observations. Three of its sensors were SBRs—a synthetic aperture radar, an  altimeter, and a scatterometer. As the reader will discover in this chapter, these three  Seasat instruments established the initial paradigm for virtually all subsequent radars  of their respective classes.1,2Chapter 18 ch18.indd   1 12/19/07   5:13:51 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Also not  covered are Type III SBRs, such as multi-spacecraft systems for space-based radar  surveillance of the Earth’s surface or airspace. (Although these large SBR concepts are  interesting in principle, their implied costs remain a disincentive, particularly if their  erstwhile sponsors expect their performance to approach the current state-of-the-art in  airborne search or surveillance radars.) Except for the mention of a few basic concepts,  this chapter does not delve into the extensive subjects of orbitology, implementation  of space-qualified hardware, nor system integration and test, for which the interested  reader is directed to standard references.3,4 Basic Orbit Characteristics.  Unlike an airborne platform that can go anywhere  at any time (subject to fuel and air-space limitations), a satellite’s position and veloc - ity when in orbit about a planetary body are rigidly governed by orbital dynamics,  summarized compactly by Kepler’s laws. 
Further, access by an SBR to a given area  of interest depends on the rotation rate of the planet, as well as the satellite’s position  along its orbit and the radar’s viewing geometry. Thus, the primary parameters to be  included in SBR mission design include orbital altitude, spacecraft on-orbit velocity  (and hence period), orbit inclination, and the rotation rate of the planet. Earth-observing SBRs, such as SARs, tend to operate from spacecraft in near-   circular low-Earth orbits (LEO). 
Typical LEO altitudes span 500 km to 850 km. Lower  altitudes incur larger atmospheric drag, whereas higher altitudes imply higher radia - tion levels and longer radar ranges, neither of which are desirable in most situations.  Spacecraft velocities at these LEO altitudes are on the order of 7.5 km/s; their cor - responding periods are about 100 minutes. 
Earth rotation (at a rate of ∼0.25 degree/ min) shifts the sub-satellite point at the equator by ∼3300 km orbit-to-orbit. The orbit  altitude normally may be chosen to tune the period and Earth rotation rate so that an  exact-repeat pattern develops that has a stipulated number of days. The repeat period FIGURE 18.1  The Seasat satellite, featur - ing the antennas of its three radars ( Courtesy  of NASA ) ch18.indd   2 12/19/07   5:13:52 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.36x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 often is an integral number, such as the 24-day repeat of RADARSAT, although a  non-integral period may be preferred, such as the 9.916-day repeat of the TOPEX/ Poseidon radar altimeter. 
Orbit parameters such as repeat period must be maintained,  requiring small boosts from spacecraft thruster maneuvers,4 typically applied every  several weeks for LEO missions. The revisit time of a given SBR asset depends on the  range swath width covered by the radar in question, as well as the orbit’s exact-repeat  period and the latitude of the site of interest. The off-nadir* look angle of certain SBRs  can be adjusted to increase the effective revisit rate. 
Note that orbit maneuvers are not  a practical means to improve the frequency of site coverage, since a large change in  altitude (hence velocity), or especially any change of orbit inclination (the angle of  the inertial orbit plane with respect to the Earth’s equator), would require a substantial  expenditure of precious onboard fuel resources.3 The Earth is flattened at the poles, due primarily to its relatively rapid rotation. The  resulting lack of spherical symmetry in the gravity field at orbital altitude imposes  small lateral forces on an inclined orbit plane, which consequently precesses in inertial  space. The amount, direction, and rate of orbit precession can be controlled by choice  of the inclination and the mean altitude of the orbit. 
Many satellite platforms use this  degree of freedom to generate a sun-synchronous orbit, which is one that maintains a  constant angle of its orbit plane relative to solar illumination over the entire year. The  European Space Agency’s Envisat spacecraft is a good example of a sun-synchronous  LEO, having ∼98.5° inclination† and 785 km altitude. Sun-synchronous spacecraft   that host optical instruments (such as Japan’s ALOS) choose the phase of the sun angle  to favor illumination of the surface, which usually leads to a midday orbit from which  most of the Earth’s surface is viewed at about the same local time, near midday. 
Such  orbits imply that the spacecraft must pass through the Earth’s shadow about half the  time, which has consequences on the design of the thermal and power subsystems in  particular. In contrast, spacecraft that carry only radars, such as RADARSAT, tend  toward favorable illumination of the spacecraft. The natural result in this case is the so- called dawn-dusk orbit, in which the satellite—and its solar-panel-dependent power  system—avoids the shadow of the Earth almost always for almost all seasons. 
Certain applications are particularly well-served by exact-repeat orbits. For exam - ple, if a group of orbital trajectories falls within a small radius of each other when over  an area of interest, then radar measurements from several orbits may be compared  coherently, thus potentially sensitive at the order of a wavelength to changes in the  scene between observations. Such coherent change detection is a standard technique in  the field of space-based SAR interferometry, reviewed in the following section. 
Exact- repeat orbits are standard for most radar altimeters, but for geophysical reasons, not  for mutual coherency. Sun-synchronicity presents its own problems for ocean-sensing  altimeters. These comments are elaborated in Section 18.3. 
As discussed in several chapters of this book, the performance of doppler-sensitive  radars is conditional upon the velocity of their host platform. The velocity of a space - craft in orbit at altitude h above a planet of radius RP and mass MP is given by  V M G R hP P SC= + / ( ) (18.1) *  Nadir  is the point below the spacecraft on the surface intersected by the radius vector from the Earth’s center to  the spacecraft. †  Inclinations greater than 90 ° are retrograde because their E-W velocity component in the ascending pass is contrary  to the direction of the Earth’s rotation, in contrast to prograde orbits whose inclinations are less than 90 °.

18.4  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 where G is the universal gravity constant‡ 6.67 × 10–11 Nm2kg–2. Table 18.1 lists rep - resentative spacecraft velocities for bodies in the solar system that have been visited,  or are likely to be observed, by range-doppler radars. Feasible satellite altitudes are  limited below by the prevailing atmospheric density. 
The final column of the table  lists the altitude-velocity product hVSC corresponding to each entry. This product is a  scaling factor that characterizes the range-doppler space confronting an SBR intended  to be deployed in that environment. There is approximately a 40-fold spread in the  value of this parameter, from the Earth to Jupiter’s moon Europa. 
It follows that radar  designs that work in one situation may not be at all appropriate if migrated to a differ - ent planetary body. It is often said that radar is “all-weather,” but this generalization clearly is not  universally true, especially for SBRs. From space, the ionosphere and/or atmosphere  may corrupt or even prevent radar propagation. 
The ionosphere may induce Faraday  rotation,§ thus degrading or destroying the polarization properties of the transmit - ted and received signals.4 The Faraday rotation b of a linearly-polarized E-vector is  proportional to RM l2, where the rotation measure RM is a function of ionospheric  electron density. The ionosphere also introduces dispersion and, under certain unfa - vorable circumstances, effectively cuts off propagation. Thus, for example, it was  not possible for the 5-MHz MARSIS radar sounder to probe the Martian surface dur - ing daylight hours, because the cutoff frequency under those conditions increased to  about 10 MHz. 
Thus, MARSIS worked as a surface sounder during dark hours and  as an ionospheric sounder during daylight hours. More on the MARSIS radar may be  found in Section 18.6. The 12-cm wavelength of the Magellan Venus radar (reviewed  in Section 18.4) was chosen in response to the trade-off between propagation through  Venus’ very dense atmosphere (for which longer wavelengths would be better) and  synthetic aperture radar system considerations (for which shorter wavelengths would  be better). 
Propagation speed is retarded along the path length from an ocean-viewing  altimeter to the Earth by a very small fraction of the speed of light, but sufficient nev - ertheless to impose range measurement errors of many meters. These errors must be  estimated and compensated before the required cm-level accuracy can be achieved,  as summarized in Section 18.3. Comments on Hardware.

Because a radar by definition must transmit,  its near-field radiation is a potential threat to all other instruments and subsystems  of the host spacecraft and its payload. Once having got past the risk (or paranoia) of  near-field radiation, normal spacecraft design principles kick in. The first order con - siderations on hardware that are characteristic of (and essentially unique to) the space  environment include radiation and energetic particles, vibration (especially during  the launch phase), harsh and contrasting thermal environments, often challenging  mass limitations, and a premium on payload power. 
In Earth orbit and, perhaps sur - prisingly, also at the Moon, a space-based radar must comply with internationally  agreed spectral allocations. These limit both the available bands and the bandwidths,  which impact system design and may constrain certain performance objectives, such  as resolution. Since it is expensive to get to orbit, SBRs, like other space-based systems, must be  designed to minimize mass and to maximize efficiency and longevity. 
Mass, power,  and lifetime emerge as driving themes that dictate conservative design, generous  margins during system implementation, and redundancy often realized by dual-string  hardware in most if not all subsystems other than the antenna. Organization of the Chapter.  The chapter sections are organized by measure - ment theme, taken in a broad sense. 
These themes are Earth-orbiting synthetic aperture  radar (SAR), radar altimetry (which in the SBR context almost always implies obser - vation of the Earth’s oceans and larger surface water bodies), planetary radars (where  “planet” includes planetoids such as large moons), scatterometers (whose data associ - ate a geophysical parameter such as oceanic wind speed to the observed calibrated  radar backscatter properties of the illuminated surface), and sounders (which includes  both atmospheric and subsurface radar systems). Each section includes an overview of  all relevant SBRs, noting key turning points or watershed innovations in the theme’s  history. Selected examples have been chosen for more in-depth review. 
Online web  sites are suggested for each cited instrument; these web sites were accessible at the  date of publication of this book.* 18.2 SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SAR) In its most general form, an imaging radar is a device designed to provide a two- dimensional portrayal of the radar backscatter returning from the field illuminated  in range and azimuth. Space-based microwave imagers are synthetic aperture radars  (with the exception of certain early Soviet ocean-observing real-aperture systems).  As with all imaging systems, SAR image products are rated according to their resolu - tion, where “higher” is “better.” Higher resolution always implies wider bandwidth in  both range and azimuth. 
Azimuth bandwidth derives from the doppler signatures set  up by the motion of the radar with respect to the illuminated field. Resolution by itself  is not sufficient to determine the image quality of importance to most applications.  *  The field of space-based remote sensing radars is subject to rapid change.

Space-Based Remote Sensing Radars. 18.6  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 SAR images are degraded by a multiplicative self-noise known as speckle , which is  a direct consequence of the coherence required by the radar-processor combination  to form the synthetic aperture and the resulting enhanced resolution. Speckle can  be reduced only through supplemental incoherent processing, multi-looking in SAR  jargon. 
Additional looks require proportionally more bandwidth. It follows that large  two-dimensional bandwidth (range and azimuth) is the driving requirement for this  class of radar. Space-based SAR systems have motivated fruitful specializations in quantitative  applications in a wide variety of areas, comprehensively reviewed in the  Principles  and Applications of Imaging Radar .5 Topics such as SpotSAR, ScanSAR, polarimetry,  and interferometry that have influenced radar system and mission design are outlined  in closing paragraphs of this section. 
Flight Systems.  The concept of SAR, introduced in 1951 by Carl Wiley,6 was  reduced to practice in subsequent years, first through simulations, then through air - borne proof-of-concept systems.7 Quill, the first space-based SAR (see Table 18.2),  was launched only a decade later. (That was a remarkable achievement, considering  that in the modern era, it often takes nearly 20 years to go from concept to launch of  a new SAR, even though the principles and technology for these SBRs are by now  well established.) Quill was rudimentary, but did succeed in generating data sufficient  to form images. 
The nominal 100-m resolution was spectacular for its time, given  that the best resolution that could be expected from an otherwise comparable real- aperture SBR would be on the order of kilometers. Nevertheless, the results did not  meet the needs of the sponsor, and so the notional second and third missions were  never launched. Quill was the only American SBR whose data were optically recorded  onboard, eventually returned to Earth by ejected capsule, and then collected by an  airborne retrieval maneuver.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.76x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 Seasat . The generally acknowledged space-based synthetic aperture radar pio - neer was the 1978 Seasat SAR (Figure 18-1). That L-band system8 persists as the  design paradigm for Earth-observing space-based SARs. 
Seasat illustrates several  characteristics of many civilian Earth-observing SARs, including the size and aspect  ratio of the antenna (10.74 m by 2.1 m), its relatively steep angle of incidence ( ∼22°),  its swath width (100 km), and use of a linear FM (chirp) modulated pulse waveform  (634:1 compression ratio). Seasat SAR’s average radiated power was relatively small  (55 W) although its peak power was appreciable (1 kW). The antenna was passive,  consisting of eight flat microstrip panels, radiating and receiving HH polarization. 
 There was no onboard recorder, so data were downlinked, but only, of course, when  in radio visibility of one of the four ground stations (in the United States, Canada,  and the United Kingdom) that were equipped to receive the data.

Imagery was generated (but  not immediately†) by either optical or digital processing methods. The Seasat satel - lite suffered a massive short circuit in its primary power system (in the solar panel  slip-ring assembly), which ended its mission in October 1978 after only three months  of operation. 
SIR SAR Series.  The Shuttle imaging radars, SIR-A (which flew on the first  Shuttle that carried a science payload), SIR-B, and SIR-C/X-SAR were essentially  technology (and science) demonstrations missions,2,9 each lasting about one week or  less. In sequence, these radars had increasingly more capability in terms of incidence,  frequency, and polarization. 
SIR-C/X-SAR operated at three bands: C and L (USA)  and X (contributed through an international partnership with Germany and Italy). Data  from SIR-C continues in demand, thanks to its fully polarimetric multiband coverage  of a wide variety of scenes.10 The Shuttle Radar Terrain Mapper11 (SRTM) was an  outgrowth of SIR-C, using a small receiving antenna (at X and C band) mounted on  a 60-m long extendable strut, to collect simultaneous backscatter subsequently pro - cessed into topographic maps. This was the first demonstration of single-pass space- based interferometric SAR capability (InSAR). 
Data were collected over a very large  fraction of the global landmass. Kosmos . Although not classified in the strict sense, Kosmos came to view largely  after the launch of its technical successor, Almaz (Russian and Arabic for diamond in  the rough ). 
Preceding these Soviet SARs were a series of real-aperture radars, known  as Okean  (and by other names). Almaz was a very interesting radar, in that it provided  unique S-band SBR imagery of the Earth’s surface. The technology behind this and  related Russian systems continued to be developed, culminating in the Kondor-E radar  and, through a bilateral technology exchange program, the HJ-1-C SAR of China.12  Both of these radars use the 6-m parabolic reflector developed originally for Priroda,  the final module for the Russian MIR complex. 
Travers, the radar aboard Priroda,  was an experimental demonstration mission. There are at least three members of the  X-band national asset SAR fleet, including TecSAR13 (Israel) and the IGS-R series  (Japan). The first IGS-R was launched in 2003. 
The 2005 launch of a sequel failed. ERS-1 and ERS-2 . The C-band SARs from the European Space Agency (ESA)  introduced operational space-based SAR capability.14 Since the launch of the first  European Radar Satellite (ERS-1), ESA SARs have maintained a continuous record  of outstanding performance. 
ERS-1 and its followers have had onboard data recording  capability. ERS-1 and ERS-2 had in common ∼25-m resolution at 4 looks, 100-km swath  width, and ∼23° incidence, all in the pattern of the Seasat SAR. The two ERS SARs were  virtually identical. 
ERS-1 and ERS-2 enjoyed about one year of simultaneous opera - tion, organized by ESA to chase each other so that their joint repeat visit was only one  day. This lead to the accumulation of a unique data set, especially valuable for coherent  change detection measurements15 (two-pass InSAR). The ERS SAR instrument was  a subset of a combined radar group, the Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), com - prised of a scatterometer and a wind/wave mini-SAR mode, as well as the SAR itself. 
  †  The first digitally processed images from the Seasat SAR required 40 hours for a quarter-frame (50 km square)   on a mainframe computer. ch18.indd   8 12/19/07   5:13:57 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.96x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 (The scatterometer mode is described in Section 18.5.) The wind/wave mode, based  on the SAR, was designed to grab 10-km square snapshot images of the ocean surface,  which could be processed (onboard or later in a ground facility) to estimate wind speed  and direction from the radar brightness and wave pattern in the data. This mode was  motivated by a requirement to gather SAR-quality data over a large area within tight  data volume limits. 
One consequence of the ocean-viewing requirements was that VV‡  emerged as the favored polarization, since vertically polarized oceanic backscatter  tends to be larger at C band at steep incidence§ than horizontally polarized oceanic  backscatter. ERS-1 and -2 also carried radar altimeters (Section 18.3). The ESA series  of satellites use midday sun-synchronous orbits because their payloads include optical  sensors. 
The resulting half-orbit eclipse contributes to their per-orbit SAR operational  limit of ten minutes. J-ERS-1.  The SAR aboard the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite14 (J-ERS-1)  was similar to Seasat, being at L band, with an H-polarized 11.9 m by 2.4 m antenna. 
 Its 38 ° incident angle,* which is larger than that of Seasat, was enabled by its lower  altitude and larger antenna aperture. Its 1.1 kW peak power was comparable to that of  Seasat. One consequence of the larger antenna vertical dimension is the 75-km swath,  which is narrower than that of Seasat. 
J-ERS-1 was crippled by antenna and connec - tor problems, so that its sensitivity (noise-equivalent sigma-zero NEq s  0 ) was only  –14 dB, 6 dB shy of its –20 dB design. As a result, J-ERS-1 image products were far  noisier than those of Seasat, whose sensitivity was –23 dB. In spite of that handicap,  however, J-ERS-1 data (at 23-cm wavelength) provided the first synoptic coverage  of the tropical forests of Brazil and neighboring countries. 
These data established an  early “gold standard” for tropical forest surveys, since L band is so much better suited  to this application than shorter wavelengths. J-ERS-1 had 18-m resolution at 3 looks,  about 50% “better” than Seasat, based on comparison of their respective SAR image  quality factors (Section 18.4). J-ERS-1 operated for eight years, considerably longer  than its two-year design life. 
RADARSAT-1  Shown in Figure 18.2, RADARSAT-1 marked a major milestone  in space-based SAR. It was the first system to offer the user a choice of resolutions,  incident angles, and swath widths.17 The evolution of these characteristics merits a  brief review. The Canadian requirements spanned a variety of applications, from oce - anic surveillance (vessels and oil platforms as well as sea state), land- and sea-ice,  agriculture, and forests, among many others. 
The sea-ice application had high pri - ority, which drove the choice of polarization. Horizontal was chosen, because that  ‡  It is common in radar remote sensing that their polarizations are abbreviated as an alphabetic pair, in this case  indicating vertical polarization on both transmit and receive. §  Space-based SARs tend to look toward the surface at angles that are much closer to vertical than do airborne SARs. 
 The most commonly used terminology is incidence (the angle at the illuminated surface between the local vertical  and the incoming illumination). The angle of incidence is the complement of the grazing angle, the customary  nomenclature for airborne radars. Incidence differs from elevation (the angle at the spacecraft between vertical and  the direction from the spacecraft to the scene), where the difference is due to the Earth’s curvature. 
*  Alert! The Japanese SARs usually specify the look angle as the elevation angle at the spacecraft, although calling  that angle “incidence.” Thus, most of the literature cites 35 ° for J-ERS-1’s incidence, which can lead to confusion  if the value of this parameter is important in a given application. The same caveat applies to PALSAR, described  in a subsequent paragraph. ch18.indd   9 12/19/07   5:13:58 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Space-Based Remote Sensing Radars. 18.10  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 offered an advantage when attempting to distinguish new ice from calm sea at C band  and moderate incidence. 
The applications diversity implied a span of preferred inci - dence from ∼20° to more than 50 °. In response, the antenna was required to steer its  beam in elevation, which evolved into seven different standard elevation beam pat - terns, electronically steered and shaped. As might be expected, no applications theme  would accept degraded resolution. 
To satisfy that demand, the radar design adopted  three bandwidths, so that the nominal ground-range resolution would be maintained  at ∼25 m over all baseline incident angles. As a corollary, the wider bandwidth at  shallower incidence would result in finer range resolution. The antenna design was  based on horizontal runs of 32 waveguides, each center-fed. 
Ferrite phase-shifters,  one for each waveguide, controlled the transmit and receive beam shape and boresight  in elevation. The electronic beam-selection enabled RADARSAT-1 to incorporate  ScanSAR.† Thus, the resolution options for RADARSAT-1 range from 8 m by 8 m  (single look) 45-km swaths (fine mode), to 100 m by 100 m (8 looks), 510 km swaths  (ScanSAR Wide). Incidence ranges from 10 ° to 60 °, including the extended modes. 
 There are seven standard modes, each having its own elevation beam; these modes  have nominally 25 m by 28 m (4 looks), 100-km swaths. The NEq s  0 is –20 dB or  better and mode-dependent. By the end of 2006, RADARSAT-1 had completed its 11th year, logging more  than 60,000 orbits and collecting enough data to map the entire surface of the Earth  an equivalent of 130 times. 
The Canadian Ice Service relies on RADARSAT-1 data  for its routine operations, which require more than 3000 frames of data per year. Since  the SAR is the only RADARSAT-1 payload instrument, a sun-synchronous, dawn- dusk orbit was chosen to maximize illumination of the solar panels, which allows  20 minutes of SAR operation per orbit. RADARSAT-1 looks to the right side of the  orbit plane, which gives it access to the Canadian Arctic up to the North Pole. 
Twice  during its mission, the spacecraft was yawed 180 ° for several weeks, which enabled  full coverage of Antarctica. The resulting data were merged to yield the first high- resolution imagery of the whole continent,18 and over several regions, repeat-pass  coverage supported interferometric SAR measurement of Antarctic glacial flow rates.  RADARSAT-2 is an enhanced version19 of RADARSAT-1. 
Table 18.3 charts a sum - mary of its many modes.20FIGURE 18.2   RADARSAT-2 is outwardly similar to its predecessor.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.116x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 ENVISAT.  The advanced SAR21 (ASAR) aboard ESA’s Envisat takes  RADARSAT-1’s versatility one step further, with the addition of two polarizations,  H and V, on either transmit or receive. Its 10 m by 1.3 m active array antenna com - prises 320 transmit/receive modules. 
In other regards, its modes reflect the basic  RADARSAT-1 design (due, in large part, to the participation by key radar specialists  from Canada—a member of ESA’s Earth Observation Program Board—on the ASAR  conceptual design team). The transmit and receive polarizations are independent of  each other, so that at full resolution, the polarization choices are HH, VV, or HV. Note  that this dual-polarization mode is actually alternating -polarization, in which the  polarization states are switched between transmissions or receptions, but the pulse- repetition frequency is not increased. 
Such a “dual-polarized” pair, by definition,  cannot be mutually coherent since it corresponds to interleaved samples of the back - scatter, time-multiplexed at less than the Nyquist rate. As a consequence, the phase  difference between complex samples at each pixel is not available. The ASAR alter - nating polarization mode provides dual-polarized images that are similar to those that  have been available from many airborne systems for decades, although not available  from an SBR (except for SIR-B and SIR-C) until ENVISAT. 
PALSAR.  In contrast to the incoherent polarimetric options of ASAR, the Phased- Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) aboard Japan’s ALOS‡ (launched  in January 2006) includes full quadrature§ polarimetry.22,23 The PALSAR modes  include standard single-polarization mapping modes, a ScanSAR mode, a variety of  dual- and quadrature-polarized modes, and experimental modes, including SpotSAR.  Early mission calibration and validation studies verified that the radar is performing  as intended. 
More on PALSAR appears later in this section.TABLE 18.3 Rsat-2 Modes  Mode Width W Access Resolution Looks 1/QSAR W QSAR Selective polarization km km m, Rg × Az Rg × Az Standard 100  250–750 25 × 26 1 × 4  162 0.62 Wide 150  250–650 30 × 26 1 × 4  195 0.77 Fine  50  525–750 8 × 8 1 × 1  64 0.78 ScanSAR Wide 500  250 –750 100 × 100 4 × 2 1250 0.40 ScanSAR Narrow 300  250–720 50 × 50 2 × 2  625 0.48 Single polarization Low incidence 170  125–300 40 × 26 1 × 4  260 0.65 High incidence  70 750–1000 18 × 26 1 × 4  117 0.60 Polarimetry Standard QuadPol  25  250–600 25 × 8 1 × 4  50 0.50 Fine QuadPol  25  400–600 9 × 8 1 × 1  72 0.35 Selective Single Pol Multi-look Fine  50  400–750 8 × 8 2 × 2  64 3.12 Ultra-Fine  20  400–550 3 × 3 1 × 1   9 2.2 Experimental MODEX (GMTI) Very High Resolution 3 × 1 1 × 1 ‡  Advanced Land Observation Satellite, JAXA, Japan. §  Discussed later in this section. ch18.indd   11 12/19/07   5:13:59 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 Known alternatively as Remote Sensing Satellite-1, Jianbing- 5 is China’s first synthetic aperture radar mission. The spacecraft mass is 2700 kg,  launched into a sun-synchronous orbit at ∼600 km altitude. Mission objectives include  polarimetric diversity and interferometry. 
The two baseline multi-look resolutions are  3 m (40-km swath) and 20 m (100-km swath), over a variety of incident angles. Its  antenna is an active phased array. TerraSAR-X. 
 TerraSAR-X is the first civilian dedicated space-based SAR at  X band. Its 4.8 m by 0.8 m antenna is a two-dimensional active array of 384 T/R  modules. It has a variety of modes, from ScanSAR (15-m resolution over 100-km  swaths) to SpotSAR (1-m resolution over a 5-km by 10-km image frame). 
Its strip  mapping mode is baselined at 3-m resolution across 30-km swaths. The array is  partitioned in the along-track direction, which can be exercised in a two-aperture  along-track interferometric mode for GMTI experiments, among other applications.  Full quadrature polarization is one of the mode options. 
The only payload instrument  is the radar, so the spacecraft is designed for a sun-synchronous dawn-dusk orbit,  11-day repeat. Several years after the launch of TerraSAR-X, it will be joined by a  companion, Tandem-X, which is meant to be a functional copy.24 These two will co- orbit as a closely coordinated pair to support a variety of bistatic and interferometric  applications. Other Space-based SARs. 
 Space-based SAR continues to undergo consid - erable expansion on an international front. This section provides an overview of  programs known (at the time of publication of this Handbook) to have progressed  through Phase A, which is evidence of funding that is sufficiently serious that most  are likely to culminate in the launch and operation of a flight system. The archi - tecture of these emerging systems is dominated by one of two antenna paradigms:  active two-dimensional phased arrays or reflectors. 
Most missions are multimode in  resolution (hence swath and coverage), and polarimetry (ranging from incoherent  dual-polarization to full-quadrature polarimetry). At least four of these initiatives  imply several satellites, either in constellation or in series. All together, something  in excess of 20 new SARs are being launched in the first decade of the 21st century,  from at least eight different countries. 
Highlights of several of these systems are  summarized in the following paragraphs. COSMO-SkyMed . Italy has a series of four COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR  satellites. 
The COSMO SARs have multipolarization active phased-array antennas  that support a variety of modes including 1-m SpotSAR, strip map, ScanSAR, and  500-km wide swath. The COSMO bus is based on the design built and flight-proven  for Canada’s RADARSAT-2. TecSAR. 
 The first space-based SAR from Israel, TecSAR is a featured element  of their national satellite technology development program.25 Launched by India,  TecSAR’s nominal strip-map mode is multi-look 3-m resolution at X band. Major  additional objectives include large area coverage as well as high resolution, which  imply ScanSAR and SpotSAR modes, respectively. The 1-m SpotSAR resolution  constrains the design, one consequence of which is the symmetrical body-mounted  3-m diameter umbrella-style mesh reflector (0.5 kg) driven by one of ten feed horns  slightly offset from the focal point. 
This unity-aspect ratio antenna is a notable depar - ture from the rectangular antennas so typical of most space-based SAR precedents.  ch18.indd   12 12/19/07   5:13:59 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.136x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 ScanSAR coverage (8-m resolution, 40-km swath, to 20-m resolution, 100-km swath,  incidence-dependent) is executed by sequential selection of the appropriate feeds. The  feed horns are H- or V-polarized, so that polarimetric diversity is also supported by this  arrangement. 
Mission design includes spacecraft steering to support squinted aspects  relative to the reference side-looking orthogonal viewing. The high-power stage is  comprised of ten channeled TWTAs,* eight of which are required in combination,  leaving two as redundant backup. The radar mass is 100 kg (including the reflector  and feeds); satellite dry mass including the radar is ∼300 kg, which at the time set the  standard as the smallest SAR satellite in Earth orbit. 
The power subsystem delivers  up to 1.6 kW during imaging operations. The spacecraft orbit is 143 ° inclination,  ∼550 km altitude, 36-day repeat period. Since this is not a sun-synchronous orbit and  since the antenna pattern (to first order) is symmetric, the spacecraft may be rotated  about the radar’s line-of-sight to help sustain near-full illumination of the two solar  panel arrays in all sun-orbit plane configurations. 
Radar data are recorded in a 256 Gbit  solid-state unit following 6-to-3 block-floating-point quantization. Spacecraft design  life is five years. HJ-1-C. 
 HJ-1-C is the first of five SAR satellites in China’s small satellite  program24 announced in 2002 for environment and disaster monitoring. The archi - tecture of these systems is closely parallel to Russia’s Kondor-E  series, since they  are both outgrowths of a bilateral development program based on the architecture  of the Priroda S band radar. The HJ-1-C’s antenna is a reflector that has an effec - tive aperture of 6 m by 2.8 m following deployment. 
In strip-map mode, the HJ- 1-C has a multi-look 5-m resolution over a 40-km swath, and 20-m resolution in  ScanSAR mode at 100-km swath width. SpotSAR mode is supported by controlled  yaw maneuvers of the spacecraft. All of the spacecraft in the series (five radars and  six optical systems) use sun-synchronous orbits at ∼500 km altitude. 
The radar’s  mass is ∼200 kg. SAR-Lupe.  Germany has five identical X-band satellites, distributed in three  500-km high orbits, inclined at about 80 °.

Space-Based Remote Sensing Radars. 18.14  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 antennas suggests that the dominant objective is fine resolution, which necessitates a  relatively narrow range swath. 
Published specifications note that the intended reso - lution in the slip-SAR† mode is 0.12 m over a 5 km by 5 km image frame. These   innovative SBRs are relatively small, at least by Earth-observing satellite SAR stan - dards. Their 770 kg mass (total dry mass of the spacecraft and the radar) is less than  the mass of RADARSAT-2’s antenna! The SAR-Lupe design also is cost-conscious,  based on rigid (nondeployed) reflector antennas (“borrowed” from a commercial  communications satellite production line) that are inherently more efficient and less  massive than an active array. 
The radar electronics are directly descended from a  commercial product line. RISAT . The Radar Imaging Satellite, or RISAT, is India’s first space-based  SAR,27 following extensive programs in optical remote sensing satellites and airborne  imaging radar development. 
RISAT’s deployable antenna (6 m by 2 m) is an active  phased array comprised of 288 C-band (5.35 Ghz) TR modules, each capable of 10 W  peak power. The average output power (200 W) requires an average input dc power  of 3.1 kW. Each TR module is connected to separate distribution networks feeding  H- and V-polarized elements, which support polarization diversity as well as eleva - tion beam steering. 
There are two parallel receive channels (dedicated to the H- and  V-polarized antenna elements). RISAT has five modes, each of which may operate at  a variety of incident angles. The modes are: fine-resolution strip-map-1 (3-m resolu - tion, 30-km swath, dual-polarization); fine-resolution strip-map-2 (12 m at 30 km,  quadrature-polarization); medium resolution ScanSAR (25 m at 120 km, dual-polar - ization); coarse resolution ScanSAR (50 m at 240 km, dual-polarization); and high- resolution SpotSAR (better than 2 m, 10-km square image frame, dual-polarization). 
 The SpotSAR mode requires yaw/pitch steering of the spacecraft to ±13°. Coverage  to either side of the ground track requires a roll maneuver of the spacecraft to direct  the antenna pattern to the opposite side of nadir, an approach that is similar to that of  RADARSAT-2. The variety of resolutions is supported by four bandwidths (225 MHz,  75 MHz, 37.5 MHz, and 18.75 MHz) through a programmable digital chirp generator. 
 The received data are downconverted to baseband, digitized to 8 bits (I and Q), and  quantized (by block-floating point means) to fewer bits (6 to 2), at the user’s option  within mode-dependent limits. All subsystems (save for the antenna) are dual-redun - dant. Nominal PRF is 3250 Hz ± 450 Hz. 
Data rates span 142 Mbits/s to 1478 Mbits/s,  depending on mode. The on-orbit mass of the spacecraft will be ∼1750 kg, of which  the SAR payload (including the antenna) claims ∼950 kg. Onboard data storage capac - ity is 240 Gbits; downlink maximum data rate is 640 Mbits/s (X band, dual circularly  polarized). 
The RISAT orbit is sun-synchronous, dawn-dusk, at ∼609 km altitude, and  13-day revisit period. MAPSAR . The Multi-Application Purpose SAR28 is a joint Brazilian-German  enterprise aimed primarily at assessing and monitoring Brazil’s natural resources. 
 After several years of trade studies, L band was selected (1.3 Ghz). The radar is built  around a near-symmetrical reflector (7.5 m by 5 m) with ten feeds, offset from the  focal point so that the beam can be electronically scanned in elevation. Spatial resolu - tion and swath span 3 m to 20 m, and 20 km to 55 km, respectively, mode-dependent. 
 †  Slip-SAR is a modified ScanSAR mode, in which the antenna pattern is dragged along the surface at a slower rate  than in the conventional strip-map mode. The result is larger doppler bandwidth, hence enhanced azimuth resolu - tion, and also a wider imaged area than a pure SpotSAR can support. ch18.indd   14 12/19/07   5:14:00 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

There  is provision for all polarimetric configurations. The sun-synchronous orbit will be con - trolled to assure reliable 37-day revisit baselines to support interferometry. Nominal  instrument mass is 280 kg. 
PALSAR.  Although based on J-ERS-1 heritage, PALSAR29 is an excellent early  example of multimode space-based SARs. PALSAR’s 132 modes (Figure 18.4) include  standard single-polarization mapping, ScanSAR, a variety of dual- and quadrature- polarized modes,‡ and experimental or demonstration modes including SpotSAR. 
 The L band (23 cm) baseline frequency (1270 MHz) has two bandwidths, 28 MHz  (fine-beam single-polarization mode), and 14 MHz (dual-, quad-pol, and ScanSAR  modes). The span of mid-swath incident angles is (7.9 ° –60°). (Note that the Japanese  usually cite these angles as “off-nadir” (9.9 °–50.8 °), which refers to their elevation  with respect to vertical in spacecraft coordinates, rather than their intersection rela - tive to a local vertical at the Earth’s mean oblate spheroidal surface.) FIGURE 18.4  Overview of PALSAR’s viewing geometries. 
Each of these beam positions supports a  variety of polarization combinations, leading to a very large number of available modes.

Space-Based Remote Sensing Radars. 18.16  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 Modern space-based SARs owe their large mode variety to active electronic- steered antenna arrays. PALSAR’s antenna consists of 80 solid-state T/R modules  distributed on four panels whose deployed dimensions are 3.1 m by 8.9 m, vertical  and horizontal, respectively. 
Spacecraft velocity and antenna length dictate a lower  bound on pulse repetition frequency, which for PALSAR spans 1.5 kHz–2.5 kHz,  depending on mode. Peak transmitted power is ∼2 kW, twice that of the Seasat SAR.  The resulting sensitivity (noise-equivalent sigma-zero) is very good, –30 dB or better  for most modes. 
PALSAR’s host ALOS spacecraft is yaw-steered to maintain azimuth  antenna boresight pointing at zero doppler, which increases the likelihood of pass- to-pass interferometric coherence and simplifies (somewhat) SAR image formation  processing. The nominal data rate in most modes is 240 Mbit/s, which is downlinked  via Japan’s Data Relay Test Satellite (DRTS). The ScanSAR mode requires only half  that rate, 120 Mbit/s, which can be downlinked directly to ground stations. 
ALOS has  an onboard 96 Gbyte solid-state recorder to buffer data output from the radar, as well  as from the rest of the payload. PALSAR’s voluminous variety of modes is a curse as well as a blessing. Mission  management must cope with data collection in each of these modes, as well as phas - ing the resulting data burden to share the communications link with the two other high  data-rate instruments in the ALOS payload. 
The standard policy for the early years of  PALSAR’s on-orbit scheduling is to focus on six “default” modes—four “operational”  and two “semi-operational.” The resulting terms are (1) fixed “standard” off-nadir  angle of 41.5 ° for a great majority of the data takes; (2) polarization options to be  single-pol HH and dual-pol HH +HV; (3) quad-pol at 21.5 ° (off-nadir) for R&D dem - onstrations over preselected “supersites”; and (4) five-beam ScanSAR in HH polariza - tion. In addition, the following constraints apply: only one mode is exercised during  one 46-day repeat cycle; preferred operations are during the hours of darkness in the  ascending passes for most modes, excepting lower data-rate ScanSAR data takes dur - ing descending passes (in coordination with the optical sensors) and also excepting  extraordinary InSAR and marine applications at nonstandard incidence; and recurrent  repeat-pass coverage of selected sites in groups of eight or more 46-day cycles in sup - port of InSAR objectives. Space-based SAR Design Issues. 
 The options for space-based SAR design30,31  are more limited than for airborne systems, due primarily to the constraints imposed  by viable orbits, including especially sensor velocity, radar range ( R), and system cost.  The following paragraphs review the major themes. PRF Constraints . 
The rules that govern the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of  a space-based SAR are the same as those applicable to airborne systems, although  they play out rather differently. The fundamental requirement is that the PRF fp   be sufficiently high to sample unambiguously the doppler spectrum of width BDop,  and also sufficiently low so that there is time between transmissions to receive   the data backscattered from the intended swath of slant range (time-domain) width  TR. Thus  B f TP R Dop< < 1 /  (18.2) In practice, sufficient margin must be included in both the upper and lower limits to  account for the length of the transmitted pulse, and for the fact that neither the doppler  spectrum nor the antenna’s elevation pattern have sharp cutoffs.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.176x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 The lower bound often is recast as  BV V DfP DopSC SC Az= = <2 2β λ (18.3) which states that the PRF must be sufficiently high such that there are two transmis - sions per antenna aperture length DAz as the radar moves along its trajectory. (Here  VSC is spacecraft velocity along its orbit, b  is the width§ of the azimuth antenna  pattern, and l is the radar wavelength.) This form is intuitively satisfying, since the  single-look azimuth resolution is approximately one-half of the antenna’s along-track  width, hence this inequality requires that each resolved along-track range line must  be sampled at least once. Usually the PRF lower bound is set so that there is a margin  of 25% or more with respect to this constraint. 
In an airborne SAR, the PRF constraint is derived to satisfy the doppler bandwidth,  from which follows the maximum range that the radar can operate without introduc - ing ambiguities. However, by default, the minimum range for a space-based SAR is  its orbital altitude, usually 600 km or higher. The typical slant range to the intended  scene may be 800 km and more. 
Thus, the upper bound on the PRF should not be set  by the range to the scene, but rather by the range width of the area to be imaged. As a  consequence, the resulting high PRF will generate a sequence of pulses at any moment  that are distributed between the radar and the scene. The space between pulses must be  larger than the intended swath width. 
For example, in certain modes RADARSAT-1  generates seven pulses “in flight” simultaneously. At the beginning of such a data col - lection, backscatter from the intended scene would arrive only after the seventh pulse  had been transmitted. In many airborne systems, the PRF is chosen to be rather higher than the limit  imposed by the range to the intended target space. 
In such cases, the extra PRF con - tributes to improved SNR, but at the cost of increased average data rate. Data rate  can be decreased by “pre-summing”—coherently adding n adjacent returns. The con - sequence, of course, is that the effective PRF is reduced by the same factor n. 
This  practice is seldom acceptable for space-borne SARs, because it leads to azimuth ambi - guities unless the doppler spectrum is limited prior to PRF reduction. Ambiguities . The PRF generates a two-dimensionally sampled space when the  data are decomposed into “slow time” (in the azimuth direction) and “fast time” (in the  range direction). 
In azimuth, the PRF creates aliased versions of the data illuminated  by the main beam of the antenna. The spectra of these aliases are located at multiples  of the PRF to either side of the doppler centroid of the main beam. Of course, when  sampled they are folded back into the Nyquist passband. 
These aliases are azimuth  ambiguities, which are suppressed—hence not visible—in a well-designed system  supported by a well-tuned processor. When they do appear, azimuth ambiguities are  relatively easy to identify (Figure 18.5) because they are weaker (ghost) duplicates of  image features that were collected through the main beam and, therefore, at earlier or  later positions along the image strip. The azimuth shift of the ambiguities relative to  the central image is an integral multiple of ∆X R f VP =λ/ ( ) 2SC, which is the spatial  §  For a uniformly illuminated aperture, the −3 dB beamwidth is b  = 0.88 l  /DAz. 
It is customary for analysis of SAR  systems to approximate this expression by b ∼ l  /DAz and to interpret b  as the width of the rectangle that has the  same peak value and area as the antenna pattern. ch18.indd   17 12/19/07   5:14:08 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Azimuth ambiguities, especially from point targets,  have the same doppler FM rate as scatterers within the main beam, and so their focus  is preserved through the processor. 
In the range direction, one of the consequences of having many pulses in flight at  once is that there are echoes from several different ranges that arrive back at the radar at  the same relative delay within the range gate as the reflections from the intended swath.  If these extra echoes are sufficiently strong, the resulting image artifacts are range ambi - guities. Range ambiguities are not as easy to identify as azimuth ambiguities, because  they arise from ranges outside of the nominal swath, hence not otherwise imaged. 
Range  ambiguities by definition arise from ranges that are different from those for which the  processor is set, so that range-ambiguous point targets tend to be defocused. The principal means of suppressing ambiguities is to confine the main beam of  the antenna so that the potential sources of azimuth or range ambiguities are not illu - minated, or at least are illuminated only very weakly. This requirement imposes a  minimum area constraint on the SAR’s antenna. 
The lower and upper bound PRF  constraints of BDop and 1/ TR lead to  D D RV cEl Az SC Inc >4 ( / )tan λq (18.4) where the antenna area is the product of its length DAz and height DEl, and q  Inc is the  mean incident angle in the imaged swath. The range-velocity product in this expres - sion is determined by the parameters peculiar to the particular planet (or moon) about  which the SAR is to operate (Table 18.1). As a consequence, an antenna of area 1 m2  at the Moon would have be 10 m2 for the same radar at Mars and nearly 40 m2 for  operation in Earth orbit. 
It always is tempting to push this constraint, since most space-based SARs use as  much of the ambiguity-free space as can be tolerated. In practice, the antenna area  usually is chosen to be at least a factor of two larger than this minimum would sug - gest. Ambiguities are proportional to the strength of the offending backscatter, and as  such, they contribute to the multiplicative noise* ratio (MNR) of the system. 
Antenna  sidelobes and ambiguities are further suppressed by appropriate weighting in the  processor. The trade-off is lower MNR, at the expense of broader impulse response  width (IRW). Typical designs provide ∼20% excess range and doppler bandwidth  relative to those implied by the required range and azimuth resolutions to accom - modate such weighting. 
Nadir Return . A potentially troublesome range ambiguity arises from the surface  directly below the spacecraft. This nadir return is always relatively strong, particularly  if there are specular backscattering components. 
Since any realistic antenna pattern  has a non-zero sidelobe directed toward nadir, the resulting reflection could appear in  the image. The main strategy is to avoid the ambiguity by choosing the PRF so that the  nadir return arrives at the same time that the radar is transmitting. This timing places  a further constraint on the pulse repetition frequency. 
It turns out that the nadir return  may not be avoidable if other constraints override the available PRF options. This  occurs, for example, if the driving requirement is ScanSAR, which has its own set of  constraints on PRF. *  Multiplicative noise, a standard specification in synthetic aperture radar, includes unwanted contributions such as  ambiguities and quantization noise that are proportional to the strength of the received signal.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.196x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 Antennas and Transmitters . Antennas for the pioneering space-based SAR sys - tems were exclusively passive, such as the L-band patch array on Seasat or the slot - ted waveguide arrays used on ERS-1/2 and Almaz. The first exception to this rule  was RADARSAT-1, designed around an array of 32 horizontal slotted waveguides,  each of which was center-fed through a phase shifter so that the elevation beam pat - tern could be selected and shaped electronically. 
More ambitious (read “massive and  expensive”) systems tend to use two-dimensionally active electronic scanned arrays  (ESAs). These are populated by transmit/receive (T/R) modules, often incorporating  two polarizations (H and V). Examples include RADARSAT-2, ENVISAT’s ASAR,  PALSAR, COSMO, TerraSAR-X, and RISAT. 
It is argued that active arrays set the  stage for “graceful failure” since the loss of a few T/R elements would have little effect  on the net performance of the system. In parallel, an alternative SAR antenna paradigm  stresses simplicity and lower mass (and lower cost) over two-dimensional electronic  beam steering. These are reflectors, of which China’s HJ-1-C, Germany’s SAR-Lupe,  Israel’s TecSAR, and Brazil’s MapSAR are good examples. 
If a reflector is driven by  multiple feeds, then one may still effect beam steering, although with rather less beam  shape variety and control than through an ESA. Space-based radar transmitters naturally fall into two classes, intimately coupled with  the antenna’s architecture. If the antenna is active, then the transmitter (as well as the front  end of the receiver) is distributed over the array. 
In this case, several hundred T/R ele - ments, of a few watts peak power each, add up to many hundreds of peak radiated power.  Phase control of the elements is a critical parameter, usually requiring adaptive tempera - ture compensation to assure coherency of the radiated wavefront. The alternative is almost  always limited to traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), although recent developments  in high-power solid-state devices is influencing SBR SAR design. 
Radars built around  TWTAs have established impressive longevity records, witness RADARSA T-1 and   ERS-2, both of which remained in operation for more than ten years.FIGURE 18.5  Example of artifacts as they appeared in early RADARSAT-1 four  sub-swath ScanSAR imagery.

 Data rate is proportional to the product of pulse repetition frequency  fP, the number of range samples NR (which is proportional to slant-range swath, plus  the uncompressed pulse length, and inversely proportional to range resolution), the  number of quantization bits NS  retained in each sample of the data, and a factor of 2 that  accounts for the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components since both the amplitude  and the phase of the signal stream are required. Once resolution and swath are estab - lished, the number of bits per sample is the only parameter open to choice. Excellent  results may be obtained for NS, as small as 2 bits (per I and per Q) by adapting the  quantization thresholds to the mean signal level. 
(Refer to Section 18.4 for more on  this topic.) Quantization noise, which is larger for fewer bits, is proportional to signal  strength; hence it is a factor in the MNR budget. Exacting applications such as interfer - ometry are better served by more bits per sample, subject to the rate and volume limits  of the data handling subsystems. Processing. 
 Although similar in principle to airborne systems, processing for  space-based SARs differs in several key regards. The highlights are reviewed here.  For more complete coverage, see the standard references.30,32 A simplified introduc - tion to the key parameters may be helpful.33 The natural starting point is the range equation, from which several properties  emerge that are unique to the spherical geometry of radars in orbit. 
In the narrow-beam  side-looking case, and neglecting the effects of Earth rotation, the radar-to-target range  variation generates a phase time-history over a synthetic aperture length of T seconds  from a point reflector at minimum slant range R0  Θ( )t R V Vt R= − +  4 202 0π λSC Beam  (18.5) where VBeam is the velocity on the surface of the illuminating footprint of the azimuth  antenna pattern. The time derivative of the phase yields the scatterer’s doppler history  f tV V RtD( )= −2 0 λSC Beam (18.6) in which the FM rate is proportional to the effective velocity V V VEff S C B eam =( )/1 2.  This is in contrast to the airborne case for which the FM rate of the azimuth doppler  modulation is proportional to the square of the aircraft velocity. 
Why the difference?  Rather than a straight line, which is the baseline situation for an airborne system, the  synthetic aperture of a space-borne SAR is formed along an arc. This imposes a small  but significant increase in the effective length of the synthetic aperture and also modi - fies the FM rate. As a consequence, the nominal single-look azimuth resolution from  a space-based SAR is r V V DAz Beam SC Az =( / ) / 2 rather than the famous “one half of the  aperture length” of airborne SARs. 
Note that VBeam is always smaller than the space - craft velocity, and decreases with increasing spacecraft altitude and incident angle.  Alert: In certain SAR processing literature, the effective velocity for the orbital case is  denoted “radar velocity,” a rather misleading and inappropriate term. The average data rate from space-based SARs in Earth orbit is on the order of  100 Mb/s, (megabits per second) with higher resolution and polarization diversity sys - tems generating several times that. 
The drivers are the spacecraft velocity ( ∼7.5 km/s),  range resolution, and swath width. Many users would like to have immediate access  to processed data, which leads to the question of onboard processing.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.216x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 SAR systems as a rule do not implement image formation onboard for several reasons,  including high data rates. 
Processing from raw SAR data to imagery increases data  volume substantially, thus increasing the downlink data transfer burden. Perhaps more  persuasive, once processed into detected images, the options are limited for special - ized application-specific post processing. In contrast to airborne systems, the dynamics of most spacecraft are such that no  motion compensation is required for space-based SARs (unless extremely fine resolu - tion is to be generated). 
However, determining the doppler centroid of the azimuth  spectrum with respect to zero doppler emerges as a dominant issue. If the azimuth  antenna boresight is perfectly orthogonal to the inertial orbit plane, the Earth’s rota - tion imposes a doppler shift onto the received data.30 From low Earth orbit (LEO), the  magnitude of this shift is on the order of 3 °, and (to first order) varies sinusoidally  with latitude, with maximum magnitude at the equator, and with zero at the extreme  N and S latitudes. The effect can be offset by yaw-steering the spacecraft so that the  antenna’s boresight is always directed toward zero doppler. 
This orients the vertical  plane of the azimuth boresight to be orthogonal to the nadir track on the surface, rather  than to the orbit plane. Whereas SAR data from both arrangements can be processed  into satisfactory imagery, more demanding applications such as radar interferometry  are better served by yaw-steered systems. Yaw steering imposes negligible additional  demands on the spacecraft attitude control system, since it requires maneuvers of only  ±3° over each orbital period. 
Note that a SAR looks down as well as to the side, so  that vertical velocity components in the satellite’s orbit also lead to doppler shifts in  the data. In principle, a doppler shift from a vertical velocity component also could be  offset by attitude adjustments of the spacecraft, although this strategy is not in general  practice. Doppler centroid estimation is a central function implemented in all process - ing algorithms for SBR SAR data. 
Data Products.  The notional data product from a space-based SAR is imag - ery, usually visualized as a black-and-white mapping of the scene illuminated by  the radar. By definition, the digital numbers at each pixel in such an image array  are real and non-negative. 
In theory, these numbers correspond to the magnitude- squared of the focused and detected backscattered field. In practice, most image  products (such as those from the European Space Agency’s SARs) use magnitude,  because the resulting imagery has an acceptable appearance and the size of the data  file is smaller than if in |magnitude|2. If several data sets over the same scene are  combined, often these are individually color coded, leading to multicolor image  products. 
Each constituent data set might be from a different polarization, wave - length, or observation time. It is common parlance to refer to imagery as mappings of the normalized backscat - ter power s  0(x,y). Alert: In fact, this is seldom if ever  true. 
Backscattered power is  proportional to |magnitude|2, not magnitude. Hence, the user must assure that the data  are indeed magnitude-squared before applying tools, such as speckle filters, that are  designed for s  0 dimensionality. Second, s  0 implies that the data are calibrated, not  only with respect to the radiometric parameters of the radar and processor, but also  with respect to the local incident angle at the pixel location ( x,y). 
Although data from  ERS-1/2 are corrected to account for the mean incidence within the imaged swath,  there is no attempt to correct for slopes locally within the swath to the pixel level. An  alternative is to denote the (magnitude-squared) digital numbers as b  0, which indicates  simply radar power per pixel.31 This has become standard practice with RADARSAT-1  data, for example. ch18.indd   21 12/19/07   5:14:21 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Space-Based Remote Sensing Radars. 18.22  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 Standard image products usually are “multi-look.” In jargon common in the space- based SAR field, “looks” refer to statistically independent versions of the same scene. 
 When these are added together, the net result is to reduce the speckle noise, while  reinforcing the imaged features. Each such look is formed from a spectral band that  does not overlap spectra corresponding to the other looks. Thus, for a given band - width, increasing the number of looks reduces speckle, but at the cost of compromising  resolution. 
(More on this trade-off may be found in Section 18.4.) In contrast to conventional post-detection imagery, focused SAR data may be pre - sented as single-look complex (SLC) products. These data retain the full resolution of  the radar, and most important, retain the relative phase of the backscattered field. By  definition, SLC files are in amplitude and phase, often represented as an array of in- phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signed number pairs, at each pixel. 
SLC data are required  for SAR interferometry, polarimetry, and coherent change detection. Pushing Ambiguity Limits.  The baseline single-look SAR azimuth resolution  is proportional to one over the doppler bandwidth generated by the azimuth beam - width of the side-looking antenna. 
The corresponding length of the synthetic aperture  is equivalent to the along-track spread of the antenna pattern, which, of course, is  proportional to range. Let this be the canonical case. Azimuth resolution may be  sharpened only by increasing doppler bandwidth, which can be done in one of two  ways: increasing the antenna’s beamwidth or increasing the spread of aspect angles  within which the antenna illuminates a given portion of the scene. 
The latter is the  basis for Spotlight SAR,† in which the antenna is steered to dwell on the intended area  as the radar passes, thus creating a wider total doppler bandwidth (and a longer syn - thetic aperture). The trade-off is that adjacent areas along-track may not be imaged  at all. (Increasing azimuth resolution by broadening the antenna pattern, either by  reducing the aperture length or spoiling the beam, has the disadvantage of reducing  the antenna’s gain, which usually is not desirable for space-based SARs. 
In addition,  the PRF must be larger than the instantaneous doppler bandwidth, thus reducing the  allowable unambiguous range swath.) Going the other direction—smaller doppler bandwidth—leads to more coarse azi - muth resolution. The doppler bandwidth of the original signal history from a given  backscatterer may be reduced by the simple expedient of generating a shorter syn - thetic aperture than the canonical case. This logic leads to the “burst mode,” which  figures prominently in two forms in space-based SARs. 
Burst mode along a single  imaged swath implies a reduced data rate, which may be necessary to meet the strin - gent data-rate requirements confronting planetary or lunar missions. Alternatively, the  intervals between bursts may be used to illuminate several different range swaths, thus  expanding the area that may be imaged unambiguously. This is the principle behind  the ScanSAR mode. 
Ambiguity Space Trade-offs.  It is easy to show that these resolution and coverage  options are consistent with the principles that govern range and azimuth ambiguities.  The fundamental rule is that the image space (illuminated by the antenna) must be  “underspread” if ambiguities are to be avoided.34 The underspread condition is that  T BRDop<1 (18.7) †  Alternatively known as SpotSAR.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.236x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 where TR is the (slant) range swath depth of the antenna pattern and BDop is the cor - responding doppler bandwidth. To first order, the azimuth resolution is given by  rRN BL Az Az Dop=b T (18.8) where b is the azimuth beamwidth, R is slant range, NL is the number of looks (here  assumed to be taken in the azimuth domain), and ( TAz BDop) is the azimuth time- bandwidth product, comprised of the illumination time of the target, and its doppler  bandwidth. Substituting for doppler bandwidth in the underspread condition leads to  the constraint  T R N rR Lb TAzAz<1 (18.9) which shows how resolution and target illumination time may be traded against each  other while still respecting the fundamental ambiguity constraint. 
The following four  cases are important in practice. Strip Map.  The standard approach is strip mapping, in which the ambiguity-free  space is (nearly) filled with the allowable swath, resolution, and number of looks. 
Of  course, (azimuth) resolution can be increased within the allowed space at no loss of  swath width if the number of looks is decreased in proportion. SpotSAR.35,36 If (azimuth) resolution is the driving objective, then rAz may be  reduced as long as the integration time TAz is increased in proportion. Given that the  beamwidth of the antenna is fixed, the integration time can be increased only if the  beam is pointed to maintain illumination of the desired target, much as a spotlight  from a moving vehicle dwells on an area of interest. 
The usual consequence of fine  resolution in SpotSAR mode is smaller range swath and an azimuth size that is limited  above by the width of the antenna’s footprint. The required steering rate is relatively  slow, typically a few degrees over a few seconds, implemented either by moving the  antenna beam or by yaw-steering the spacecraft. Note that the radar’s PRF needs to  be only above the Nyquist limit set by the antenna beamwidth, not by the total span  of doppler frequencies collected. 
Range resolution is improved in the usual way, by  increasing the radar’s bandwidth, for which the Stretch technique is often helpful. A  variation of this mode (SlipSAR) is to drag the antenna footprint rather than to stare at  one area, thus trading poorer azimuth resolution than a pure SpotSAR would deliver  to gain increased azimuthal coverage. How far can this be pushed? Under the assumption that a target’s scattering is  coherent over a full 180 ° sector, it can be shown31 that the ultimate azimuth resolu - tion is l /4. 
By the way, such phenomenal results have been approached in the field  of seismology. Burst Mode.37 If average data rate is the driving consideration, then the integra - tion time TAz may be reduced below the canonical limit set by the azimuth antenna  beamwidth. This is accomplished by turning off the transmitter after enough pulses  have been collected to satisfy the azimuth resolution requirement. 
Each such burst has  an instantaneous doppler corresponding to the antenna beamwidth (which determines  the Nyquist PRF limit), but a shorter synthetic aperture length. Burst mode is standard  ch18.indd   23 12/19/07   5:14:30 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Space-Based Remote Sensing Radars. 18.24  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 operating procedure for planetary or lunar radars, for which high image resolution is  not required and the spacecraft-to-Earth data link is severely limited. While in burst  mode, it is customary to use each burst as a single-look data take, setting the burst rep - etition frequency so that the desired number of looks is collected during the synthetic  aperture length of the azimuth beam pattern. 
The challenge is to calibrate the antenna  pattern such that the framelets from all bursts may be combined to assemble a continu - ous image along track. Mismatches appear as “scalloping”—systematic brightness  modulations at boundaries between each of the framelets. ScanSAR.38–40 If swath width is the driving requirement, then azimuth resolution  can be traded for range coverage. 
The trick is to multiplex several burst-mode data  sets, where each set of bursts corresponds to a different range sub-swath. In this form  of burst mode, the transmitter is always “on”; the burst range sub-swath allocation  burden falls onto the antenna. ScanSAR requires rapid elevation beam steering, such  as through a phased array (e.g., TerraSAR-X), or selection of one among several range- offset feeds facing a reflector (e.g., HJ-1-C). 
In addition to suppressing scalloping,  good ScanSAR imagery requires that the several range sub-swaths be knitted together  such that the crossovers between antenna patterns are not evident. RADARSAT-1  was the first mission to implement (then to perfect) operational ScanSAR, which has  been adopted as a standard mode on many space-based SARs. Swath widths achieved  are as much as five times the nominal strip-map width, which is considerably larger  than the conventional ambiguity constraint would allow. 
Normally, the trade-off in  azimuth resolution is balanced with a corresponding compromise in range resolution,  leaving excess range bandwidth that may be converted into looks. Starting from a  100-km swath 25-m × 25-m 4-look system, a reasonable ScanSAR mode could be  500-km swath, 100-m × 100-m × 8-looks, with no increase in average data rate or  transmitted power. Note that all of these ambiguity-space trades start with the canonical case. 
The  trade-offs are relative to that starting position. A radar having an inherently small  range swath, for example, would require ScanSAR to expand the range swath to a few  tens of km, which may still be much larger than the same radar could cover without  ambiguities in a strip-map mode. Multiple Channels: Interferometry and Polarization. 
 Phase comparison  between two or more mutually coherent data sets leads to rich new possibilities, espe - cially including interferometry15 and polarimetry.41 This is particularly relevant to  space-based SARs, which have been and will continue to be rich sources of quantita - tive microwave measurements of a wide variety of surface features, enabled by these  multichannel capabilities. The following paragraphs provide only a glimpse into these  topics; the discussion is meant to whet the appetite of the reader and to provide leads  to the voluminous literature. Interferometry . 
Interferometry by radar (Figure 18.6) implies measurements that  are based on phase differences sensed through two different observations of the same  phenomena.42–45 Phase differences arise from microwave-scale changes that are due  either to differential viewing aspect or to elements of motion in the scene. In general  terms, the sensitivity of phase measurements depends to first order on (1) the radar’s  wavelength, (2) the spatial or temporal baseline of the contributing data sets, and  (3) the scale of spatial or temporal differential signals. The interferometric baseline  increases with range and with platform velocity. 
It follows that for space-based radars,  ch18.indd   24 12/19/07   5:14:30 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.256x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 conventional interferometric SAR measurements from one spacecraft platform usually  are not practical, since the implied spatial or temporal separations of the measurements  are much larger than one satellite could support. (An alert reader may note the obvious  exception to this rule, SRTM described previously, which mounted its second inter - ferometric antenna on a 60-m extendable strut.) Satellite orbits tend to be well-known, and follow very similar trajectories over  subsequent repeat periods. It follows that the space-based environment offers an  attractive alternative: repeat-pass interferometry, originally suggested by Goldstein.46  If the pass-to-pass observations are separated in the vertical plane, then interferom - etry leads to relative terrain height estimation.47 If two observations have a time  delay corresponding to the repeat period of the orbit (typically 10 to 45 days), then  sub-wavelength movements (in the line-of-sight direction of the radar) may be mea - sured.48 The technique can be extended to multiple passes with proportionate increase  in the temporal baseline, leading to quite remarkable results. 
Repeat-pass techniques  are well suited to mapping topographic relief and to long-term coherent change detec - tion for mapping glacier movement or terrestrial subsidence. If shorter time scales  are of interest, to detect moving vehicles, for example (GMTI), then a shorter inter - ferometric baseline is required, which implies two (or more) SBRs in relatively tight  co-orbiting formation. The basic SAR interferometric environment is one in which there is a pair of  mutually coherent images that have embedded phases that depend on the details of  viewing geometry and scene structure. 
The coherently combined images are known  as an interferogram, which typically contains fringes that express the interactions  between the phase structure of the two data sets. Signal processing is designed to  estimate these phase differences, and to deduce geophysical parameters of interest  from the resulting measurement.49 The interferometric signal model is simple in concept. For any neighborhood in the  scene, the input signal pair may be described by  s t a j1 1( ) exp[ ] = −Γ ϕ (18.10)FIGURE 18.6  Radar interferometry expresses the interference created between two mutually  coherent backscattered fields.

In general, scene coherence decreases  with shorter wavelength and longer time between observations. Mutual coherence is an essential ingredient for radar interferometry. Coherence  implies two constraints: spatial and temporal. 
The spatial constraint applies to the spac - ing between the orbital passes. Ideally, the radar wavelength projected onto each area  of the surface must be the same from both orbits. Since the two orbits are separated,  each area is observed at a slightly different incident angle. 
This implies that the effec - tive wavelength projected onto the ground plane is slightly different for the two cases.  Interference is supported only if the range bandwidth of the radar signal is sufficient to  span the projected wavelengths, which becomes more demanding as the orbit separa - tion increases.51 Fortunately, the range pulse has sufficient bandwidth (usually more  than 15 MHz) so that mutually coherent range bandwidths can be chosen from the data  at the time of processing. Loss of mutual coherence through increasing orbit spacing  is known as baseline decorrelation .52 One may show for reasonably level terrain that  the upper bound constraint on the difference ∆q Rad in elevation angle between the two  orbits is ∆q qRad Rad =λtan / 2rR, where rR is slant range resolution, which is inversely  proportional to range bandwidth. 
( Alert : In the SAR interferometric literature, it is  customary to use elevation angle, defined as the angle between the radar line of sight  and the Earth radius vector, as seen from the radar.) For typical large time-bandwidth  product signals, the elevation angle constraint implies that correlation of the pair of  return signals is maintained for orbital separations on the order of a kilometer. For  absolute elevation maps to be derived, however, precise knowledge to the level of one  meter is required of the spatial separation between observation tracks. Temporal coherence applies primarily to the scene. 
In order for the two signals to  act as an interferometric pair, their respective phase structures must be relatively stable  over the time interval between satellite observations. In short, there must exist mutual  coherence between the two scattering signals, even though they are observed at differ - ent times. This requirement is readily satisfied for short interopportunity intervals, such  ch18.indd   26 12/19/07   5:14:43 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

It is not neces - sarily satisfied for scenes, such as ice or vegetation, that may undergo changes in the  details of reflection and scattering between observations. In certain natural and most urban scenes, there will be many corner-reflector-shaped  features whose phase remains stable over very long time scales. These so-called per - manent (or persistent) scatterers53 support differential interferometric measurements  that may span many repeat visits of the radar, leading to remarkable sensitivity to slow- motion phenomena. 
For example, multiframe DInSAR‡ analysis of RADARSAT-1  data has led to maps of New Orleans subsidence rates,54 which vary from ∼3 mm/y to  more than 15 mm/y, with a sensitivity on the order of 2.5 mm/y. Any approach to phase difference measurement is subject to the fundamental 2 p  ambiguity characteristic of phase estimation algorithms.55,56 In many radar situations,  knowledge of the physical constraints of the situation, coupled with phase unwrapping  algorithms, is sufficient for the purpose. Polarimetry . 
For any given polarization of the transmitted wave, the reflectivity  process in general will give rise to a diversity of polarizations in the backscattered  wave. To observe these, the radar must be dual-polarized. Similarly, the reflectivity  is a function of the polarization of the transmitted wave. 
Thus, if the scattering func - tion itself is to be fully characterized, two orthogonal polarizations must be transmit - ted as well. Increasingly, polarimetric diversity is being implemented in space-based  SARs.41,57 Implementation of a fully polarimetric radar always implies greater data  channel capacity, more transmitted power, and less range swath coverage. Of course,  the antenna—the radar’s “polarization gateway”—must be able to receive, and pos - sibly also to transmit, on more than one polarization. 
In general terms, there are four options available for polarimetric diversity in a  space-based SAR. These are: (1)  Single (monostatic) polarization  Typical of all dedicated spacecraft SARs  (until the launch of ENVISAT) with either HH or VV polarizations. This custom - ary notation indicates horizontal or vertical (linear) polarizations on both trans - mission and reception for these single-polarized radars. 
(2)  Dual polarization  The traditional definition is transmission on one polarization  (usually linear, such as H), and reception on the like-polarized and the cross- polarized components (such as H and V). In a traditional dual-polarized radar, the  relative phase between the two polarized data sets is discarded. In Earth-oriented  remote sensing radars, typical combinations include HH and HV , for example,  or HH and VV (which requires two separate transmit polarizations). 
The ASAR  aboard ENVISAT is the first space-based example of this type of polarization  diversity. If the four (linear) polarization possibilities are exploited noncoher - ently, then the backscattering function of the scene may be characterized by the  three backscatter coefficients ( s  0 HH, s  0 VH, s  0 VV), which, of course, are devoid of  phase. (Note that reciprocity implies that s  0 HV = s  0 VH.) (3)  Coherent dual polarization  A dual-polarized radar that retains the relative  phase between the two received polarizations is a significant departure from  traditional dual-polarized systems. 
The modifier “coherent” helps to distinguish  ‡  Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar. ch18.indd   27 12/19/07   5:14:43 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies. All rights reserved.

Coherent dual polarization has not been exploited in orbital SARs  (although it is standard practice in Earth-based radar astronomy through facili - ties such as the Arecibo radar telescope58). 
Experience has shown that there is  relatively little added value in the phase between the like-polarized and cross- polarized returns under the condition of H or V transmit polarization. However,  an innovative alternative is to transmit circular polarization and receive coher - ently two orthogonal linearly polarized components. (See Section 18.4 for fur - ther discussion.) (4)  Full or quadrature polarization  This is the richest option because it allows full  characterization of the complex matrix of the backscatter at all resolved points in  the scene. 
It has been developed extensively in theory and in practice with data  from airborne systems and SIR-C. Japan’s PALSAR is the first operational space- based system to incorporate a quad-pol mode. Primary interest in fully polarimetric radars derives from the enriched scattering  observation possibilities revealed through replacement of the scalar form of reflectiv - ity by its complex vector counterpart.41,57,59  Thus, when either H or V polarizations are  incident on a scattering element, both polarizations are backscattered according to  E ES S S SE EHB VBHT VT  =    HH HV VH VV (18.14) where the superscript B denotes the field components reflected back toward the radar. 
 The new terms of interest represent the scene’s 2 × 2 scattering matrix, an array of four  complex numbers. Each element in this backscattering matrix expresses the magni - tude and phase imposed onto the backscattered field (superscript B) in response to the  illumination from the transmitted field (superscript T), according to their respective  polarizations. Thus, the scattering matrix is a quantitative description of the transfor - mation of polarization state upon reflection, as well as the magnitude and phase of  each reflection coefficient. 
It is often true that the field polarizations are not changed  during propagation, the irrotational assumption. In this case, the polarizations of the  backscattered waves are equivalent to those that arrive at the radar. This property  characterizes most of the polarimetry literature, at least in remote sensing applications,  and is reflected in these paragraphs. 
(The principal exception to this rule is Faraday  rotation, which may be a significant factor for longer wavelength systems, such as P  band and to a lesser extent L band.) For irrotational propagation, the portion of the backscattered field captured by the  radar is determined by the polarization vector of the receiving antenna, [ E R]. The sig - nal voltage vrec entering the system may be written in vector-matrix form as  v E EE EHR VR HB VB rec=   (18.15) This is the starting point for SAR quadrature polarimetry. Essentially, a quad-pol  SAR is managed so that the transmitter generates both orthogonal polarizations. 
The  resulting quad-pol data set can be transformed to represent all possible combinations  of transmit and/or receive polarizations. Pitfalls await the unwary, however, including  tricky coordinate conventions,59 an initially confusing variety of “standard” forms for  ch18.indd   28 12/19/07   5:14:48 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Once mas - tered, however, quad-pol SAR data is the undoubted gold standard for quantitative  scene characterization by an imaging radar. 
A space-based quad-pol capability implies a significant cost. The driving require - ment is that the data must be mutually coherent. That is relatively easy for the receiver,  which only needs to have two channels that capture simultaneously the phase and  amplitude of two orthogonal polarizations of the backscattered field. 
On the other  hand, only one polarization can be transmitted at a time. Illuminating the scene with  two polarizations requires the transmitter to be toggled between orthogonal polariza - tion states. This multiplexed transmission scheme implies that the radar’s PRF must be  doubled to satisfy the minimum Nyquist sampling rate simultaneously for each pair of  transmissions. 
Doubled PRF implies that the average radiated power must be doubled  and the unambiguous range swath is halved, both in comparison to the standard case  of transmitting only one polarization. Note that the average data rate is the same as the  dual-polarized case, since twice as much data are collected by a quad-pol mode for  each resolved point in the scene, but the swath width is smaller by a factor of two. Considerable progress continues to be made in the development of tools for quanti - tative analysis60 of polarimetric SAR data. 
When in combination with interferometric  data,61 the field is known as PolInSAR, for which dedicated specialist meetings are  convened frequently. An important methodology is target decomposition,62 through  which specific backscatter classes (such as double-bounce, Bragg, or volume) of a  scene may be separated from other types, thence subjected to interferometric analysis.  Using such techniques, it is possible to estimate the topography of the surface beneath  a vegetated canopy, for example. 
Applications . SARs are the largest class of space-based remote-sensing radars,  primarily as a result of their practical utility. Many applications are energized by  radar’s natural ability to operate at night or through cloud, fog, smoke, and haze, and  its inherent sensitivity to changes within the scene at wavelength scales. 
Radar imag - ery has proven to be valuable for a wide variety of applications, from oceanographic  observations (the theme that motivated Seasat) to measurement of millimeter-scale  displacement (such as the subsidence of urban areas or the swelling of volcanoes prior  to their eruption). Canada’s requirement to maintain near-continuous monitoring of its  northern and coastal ice is met primarily by thousands of frames of RADARSAT data  per year. India is the second largest consumer of space-based imaging radar data, used  for agriculture and forest management, and for measuring changes in its alpine gla - ciers. 
Countries such as Brazil graced with tropical forests rely on space-based radar  imagery to maintain surveillance and to compile annual statistics of deforestation.  Since radar imagery is a reliable method of mapping slicks on the ocean’s surface, it  is the principal means of monitoring oil spills that may result from a grounded tanker  or a vessel illegally pumping its bilges in a coastal area. The imaging radar reference5  cited earlier provides an excellent review of many of these applications. 
18.3 ALTIMETERS In its most general form, an altimeter is a radar device designed to measure the verti - cal distance between the radar and the surface below. In airborne applications, the  resulting “altitude” is a measure of the clearance beneath the aircraft.

Space-Based Remote Sensing Radars. 18.30  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 main objective of a space-based altimeter is also to measure the distance between  the radar and the surface, the most common application is determination of the local  sea level relative to the Earth’s geoid,§ rather than the height of the spacecraft. 
The  reference for this measurement—the orbital height of the spacecraft—must be known  by other means to within a few centimeters. Sea-surface height is a function of many  geophysical parameters, such as current flow, an El Niño event, and variations in the  ocean’s depth. Relatively small changes (on the order of cm) in mean sea-surface  height may correspond to substantial differences in the corresponding geophysical  parameters. 
It follows that range measurement accuracy  and precision  are the driving  requirements for this class of radar. The accuracy of an altimeter’s height measurement  depends to first order on knowledge of the spacecraft’s height along its orbit and on  correction of the propagation delays suffered by the radar’s round-trip waveform. The  precision of an ocean-viewing altimeter is proportional to the radar’s range resolution  and inversely proportional to the square root of the number of statistically independent  measurements (looks) combined for each data point. 
Ocean-viewing altimeters, in  general, have large SNR. Thus, bandwidth and looks become the driving requirements  on system design. The emphasis in this section is on altimeter precision. 
Sea-surface height measurements have become essential for a wide variety of appli - cations in oceanography, geodesy, geophysics, and climatology.63 With the exception  of near-polar ice, Earth-orbiting oceanographic altimeters have seen relatively little  application over nonaquatic surfaces. A satellite-based altimeter systematically circles the Earth, generating surface  height measurements along its nadir track. These measurements accumulate, provid - ing unique synoptic data that have revolutionized our knowledge and understanding  of both global and local phenomena, from El Niño to bathymetry. 
SBR altimeter data  also provide measurements of significant wave height and wind speed. Although one  might consider altimeters to be relatively simple one-dimensional (range measure - ment) instruments, their phenomenal accuracy and precision requires elegant micro - wave implementation and innovative signal processing. Overview. 
 The surface-height measurement objectives of space-based altimeters  can be grouped into four broad categories: large-scale dynamic sea-surface topogra - phy, dynamic mesoscale* oceanic features, static mesoscale sea-surface topography,  and ice—sea ice as well as continental ice sheets. Each of these measurement themes  implies narrowed constraints on choice of orbit and on the top-level instrument and  mission design. Satellite altimeters dedicated to determining the ocean’s large-scale  dynamic surface topography are characterized by absolute sea-surface height (SSH)  1-sec-averaged measurement accuracy on the order of centimeters along tracks of  more than 1000 km, and orbits that retrace their surface tracks every 10 to 20 days. 
 In contrast, mesoscale missions focus on sea-surface height signals of less than ∼300  km in length. Rather than absolute SSH accuracy, these shorter-scale applications  require precision sufficient to sustain surface slope measurement accuracy on the  order of 1 microradian (one mm sea-level change over a 1-km distance). For geodetic  signals that are expressed through static sea-surface topographic variations, orbits  are required that generate dense track-to-track spacing.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.316x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 polar ice sheets requires that the altimeter have robust range and spatial resolution,  accuracy, and precision regardless of the non-zero average surface slope in both the  along-track and cross-track direction of the continental glaciers. 
Suitable orbits for  ice sheet missions must have near-polar inclination and multiyear relative accuracy  of a few centimeters. Whereas the methodology of these instruments is to determine the distance between  the radar and the surface, like any radar, an altimeter actually measures round-trip  delay, not distance. At the accuracy required of a space-based oceanographic altimeter,  the deceptively simple proportionality of range to delay-time must take into account  the small but significant retardation of the radar’s microwaves as they propagate. 
The  cm-level SSH accuracy required of these instruments is much smaller than the ranging  errors introduced by delays through the ionosphere and the atmosphere. The delays  imposed by the ionosphere are a function of frequency. In practice, these can be esti - mated and then corrected if the altimeter measures round-trip range at two different  frequencies. 
The delays imposed by the atmosphere are comprised of two components:  the dry atmosphere and water-vapor. The dry atmosphere component is well-known  and stable at long spatial scales; in practice, the resulting delay is compensated by  recourse to model predictions. Delays due to water-vapor in the atmosphere are vari - able down to scales of several hundred kilometers (and much smaller when traversing  a storm front). 
Standard practice is to measure the integrated water vapor contribution  in the vertical column below the altimeter by a microwave radiometer, for which two  or three frequencies are required. Measurement errors are dominated by the accuracy of orbit height determination  and by the intrinsic precision of the instrument. Figure 18.7 shows a summary history  of these factors. 
The data show that 2-cm instrument accuracy is the state-of-the-art  for conventional altimeters. The delay-doppler instrument (see below) would further  improve instrument precision64 to 1 cm.

18.32  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 Centimeter-scale range accuracy is supported in the oceanographic application  by averaging over the range response of many returns. The range resolution of each  return waveform is typically on the order of 0.5 meters. These waveforms are accu - mulated and averaged pulse-to-pulse, whose shape converges on the flat-surface  impulse response65,66 (Figure 18.8). 
Sea-surface height (SSH) is derived from the  time delay to the midpoint of the waveform’s leading edge rise. One thousand or  more such waveforms averaged over one second correspond to a mean range esti - mate whose standard deviation is on the order of centimeters (which, in practice,  degrades with increasing significant wave height). One-second averages are standard  for operational altimeters, which implies an along-track resolution on the order of  7 kilometers, determined primarily by satellite velocity. 
Averaging is “the name of  the game” in radar altimetry.67 For example, global data sets from instruments such  as TOPEX and Jason-1 have been analyzed to estimate the rate of mean sea-level rise  to an accuracy of 1 millimeter per year. In addition to sea-surface height, the satellite radar altimeter’s waveform supports  two other oceanographic measurements: significant wave height (SWH) and surface  wind speed (WS). Over a quasi-flat sea, a pulse-limited altimeter’s idealized mean  FIGURE 18.8  (a) The altimeter’s pulse (typically 0.5 m long after  compression) sequentially encounters oceanic surface waves (of height  up to 20 m or more).

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.336x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 waveform is a step function, whose rise time is equal to the compressed pulse length  and whose position on the time-delay axis is determined by the altimeter’s height. 
If  the sea surface is modulated by waves, the altimetric depth of the surface increases,  which reduces the slope of the waveform’s leading edge. Hence, SWH is proportional  to the waveform rise time. If the sea surface is disturbed by the wind, the resulting  fine-scale roughness decreases the power of the pulse reflected back to the altimeter. 
 Hence, for wind speeds of more than about two knots, WS is inversely related to mean  waveform power. In practice, the inflections of the idealized flat-surface response  function waveform are softened by the pulse weighting, and the waveform is attenu - ated over time by the weighting of the antenna pattern. To extract SWH and WS from waveform data, finely tuned algorithms have been  developed and validated against in situ buoy measurements.63 For example, the  TOPEX Ku band altimeter measures SWH to within ±0.5 m up to more than 5.0 m and  WS within ±1.5 m/s up to more than 15 m/s. 
These figures correspond to averages over  1 second, or about 7 km, along the sub-satellite path of the altimeter’s footprint, which  typically is 3 km–5 km wide, determined by mean sea state. Flight Systems.  Key attributes of satellite radar altimeters are summarized in  Table 18.4. 
Since 1973, oceanic height measurement accuracy has improved, due  primarily to more effective means of estimating and correcting systematic errors.  Performance also has benefited from innovative onboard hardware and algorithms  and more precise determination of the radial component of the orbit. The Jason-1  altimeter represents the state-of-the-art in absolute sea-surface height measurement  accuracy (as of the year 2007). 
S-193 and GEOS-3.  The first satellite radar altimeter was the proof-of-concept  S-193 instrument68 that flew on three Skylab missions. Its objectives were to verify  predicted waveform response to wind and waves, to measure the radar cross section  of the sea at vertical incidence, to measure inter-pulse correlation properties, and to  observe the effect of off-nadir antenna orientation (a scatterometer experiment).

As suggested in the table, neither of these two early altimeters included a  water-vapor radiometer, and each used only one frequency, so that they had no in-built  means to correct for ionospheric or atmospheric propagation delays. Seasat ’s Altimeter . 
Seasat’s was the first to use full deramp† pulse compression,70  which opened the way for the very small range resolution required for many oceanographic  applications. The deramp technique (described below) has been adopted by all radar altim - eters since then. Seasat was designed to measure global ocean dynamic topography, as well  as wave height and surface wind speed. 
Geosat.  This altimeter’s design71 was patterned closely after that of the Seasat  altimeter. Geosat was a U.S. 
Navy military satellite whose primary mission was  to map the Earth’s marine geoid to then-unprecedented accuracy, for which a non- repeat orbit was required. Since its public release in 1995, the data set from the first   18-month geodetic mission has become the backbone of the global bathymetric  chart that is the industry standard.72,73  Geosat’s secondary mission was to  observe dynamic mesoscale oceano - graphic phenomena, for which it was  maneuvered into an exact repeat orbit  (period 17.05 days).74 Geosat’s geo - detic mission and exact-repeat mis - sion are known as GM and ERM,  respectively. As a spacecraft, Geosat  was one of the few Earth-observing  missions to rely on the purely passive  gravity-gradient means of attitude con - trol,74 as evidenced by the extended  (vertical) boom in Figure 18.9. 
The  attitude was stable to less than 1 °, to  which the altimeter’s pulse-limited  range measurement was robust. Geosat Follow-On (GFO).  GFO  was designed to replicate as much  as possible the Geosat exact-repeat  mission, in support of operational  requirements for the U.S. 
Navy. GFO  represents the current state-of-the- art in small dedicated radar altimeter  missions. It includes a dual-frequency  water-vapor radiometer (WVR) at 22  and 37 GHz, data from which are  used to reduce the corresponding  propagation uncertainty to 1.9 cm. 
 †  Full deramp (or simply deramp) is standard terminology in space-based radar altimetry.

TOPEX  was designed to measure and map the dynamic ocean topography with sufficient accu - racy to determine large-scale circulation patterns.75 TOPEX’ most famous contribution  is early observation and near-real-time monitoring of El Niño events, whose height  signature over the equatorial eastern Pacific ocean typically is an increase on the order  of 10–20 cm with respect to the mean. Poseidon, contributed by France, was a small  proof-of-concept instrument that had a solid-state transmitter. 
Poseidon was the pre - cursor of the Jason altimeters and the SIRAL instrument aboard CryoSat. The T/P orbit repeat period was chosen carefully to satisfy adequate observation of  the dominant aliased tidal constituents. All solar tidal constituents would be ambigu - ous with other height signals if the repeat period were an integral number of days. 
For  T/P, the time of day for each subsequent observation slips by about two hours. The  T/P repeat pass footprint location accuracy is better than ±1 km, a requirement that is  bounded by the cross-track gradient of the oceanic geoid. The T/P instrument pack - age included a three-frequency radiometer. 
TOPEX was the first altimeter to use two  frequencies (time-multiplexed) to estimate and compensate for propagation delays76  imposed by ionospheric electrons. Designed for an initial three-year mission, subse - quently stretched to five years, T/P provided valuable data for an impressive thirteen  years. T/P was formally decommissioned in December 2005. 
As is true for most radars, the received waveform produced by an individual pulse  from TOPEX was corrupted by coherent self-noise known as speckle. The standard  deviation of speckle is reduced by summing (averaging) many statistically independent  waveforms together. Statistical independence between sequential returns observed by  a radar altimeter depends primarily on the radar pulse repetition rate, the antenna size,  the spacecraft velocity, and on the sea surface conditions.67 The antenna was a 1.5-m  reflector that served both altimeter bands and also the radiometer.

The pulse rate above the  threshold improved the additive SNR, but did not contribute to speckle reduction. 
The  PRF statistical independence limit decreases with increasing significant wave height. Jason-1.  Jason-1 followed in the footsteps of TOPEX, figuratively and literally. 
 After the launch of Jason-1 into the T/P orbit, TOPEX was maneuvered into a “tan - dem” phasing so that the measurements of the two altimeters could be cross-calibrated.  Jason-2 is essentially identical to Jason-1. ERS-1, ERS-2, and ENVISAT. 
 If the altimeter is not the primary payload, then  the resulting mission and orbit are likely to be determined by other requirements,  which may compromise altimetry. The European Space Agency’s satellite altimeters  on ERS-1 and ERS-2, as well as the advanced radar altimeter21 RA-2 on ESA’s  ENVISAT, are of second priority with respect to the other instruments on their  respective spacecraft. Their sun-synchronous orbits are less than optimum for most  altimetric applications, due primarily to the fact that four of the eight dominant  tidal constituents are sun-synchronous.63 These orbits are also at lower altitudes  than the T/P orbit, which implies that orbit maintenance maneuvers must be more  frequent, thus compromising precision orbit determination. 
During a portion of its  mission, the orbit of ERS-1 was rephased to a long repeat period (176 days). That  long repeat period generated a relatively dense surface sampling grid useful for  estimating sea ice cover, geodesy, and bathymetry. The ERS-2 mission did not vary  its repeat period. 
The consequence of these orbit properties is that the resulting data  are not well suited to measuring the annual rate of sea-level rise, which is a key  climate-related variable. CryoSat.  This was the first Earth Explorer Opportunity Missions, which was part  of the European Space Agency’s Living Planet Programme. 
The mission concept77  was selected in 1999 and subsequently launched in October 2005. Unfortunately, the  launch vehicle malfunctioned. ESA and its member states authorized a replacement. 
 The CryoSat orbit has a high-inclination (92 °) and a long-repeat period (369 days, with  a 30-day subcycle), designed to provide dense interlocking coverage over the polar  regions. Its aim is to study possible climate variability and trends by determining the  variations in thickness of the Earth’s continental ice sheets and marine sea ice cover.  CryoSat is described in more detail in a subsequent section. 
AltiKa . AltiKa differs from other ocean-viewing altimeters in this section, due  primarily to its use of Ka band (35.75 GHz) rather than Ku band. The first instrument  (from France) is part of the payload on India’s Oceansat-3. 
AltiKa78 is single-frequency  since at Ka band the retardation due to the ionosphere is sufficiently small that it does  not have to be measured and compensated. However, the ∼0.84 cm wavelength is  vulnerable to atmospheric moisture; it is predicted that as much as 10% of the data  will be compromised by rain. The 33 kg instrument requires an input power of 80 W. 
  The offset-fed reflector antenna is 1 m in diameter, resulting in a beamwidth less than  half that of its Ku band counterparts. Several advantages are claimed for the smaller  beamwidth, including operation closer to land. On the other hand, the narrower beam  implies that the waveform is more sensitive to spacecraft attitude errors. 
AltiKa’s  500 MHz bandwidth leads to a pulse-limited footprint about 30% smaller than usual.  ch18.indd   36 12/19/07   5:14:54 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies. All rights reserved.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.376x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 The PRF is 4 kHz, approximately twice that of most conventional altimeters, slightly  larger than the pulse-to-pulse statistical independence condition of 3.75 kHz. Orbit Considerations. 
 Given an arbitrarily good radar altimeter, its orbit  becomes the dominant factor that may limit sea-surface height measurement accu - racy.79 Orbit selection for an ocean altimeter requires consideration of the impact of an  orbit’s inclination, repeat period, and altitude. For example, if the objective is absolute  sea-surface height accuracy over larger spatial scales and long time scales, then a  higher altitude orbit having a relatively moderate prograde inclination, and relatively  short non-sun-synchronous repeat period is the only sensible starting point. An altimeter’s revisit period is ten days or more, in contrast to tides with approxi - mately 1 or 2 cycles per day driven primarily by lunar and solar gravity. 
As a result,  all tidal signals sensed by an altimeter are undersampled. Altimetric data retain the  resulting aliases, which over the course of a year or so can be identified, quantified,  and calibrated out. An altimeter’s orbit must be chosen so that the tidal aliases do not  get confused with signals of geophysical interest. 
The T/P Orbit . The state-of-the-art (at least in accuracy and large-scale circulation  studies) is Jason-1, operating in the orbit originally designed for TOPEX/Poseidon.  The orbit parameters include repeat period 9.9156 calendar days (unfortunately, often  stated as 10 days); inclination 66 °; repeat track separation at the equator (316 km); and  altitude 1336 km. 
The radial component of precision orbit determination (POD) is on  the order of 2 cm for T/P, and Jason-1 results show POD to a level of 1.5 cm. Although  these parameters reflect the fruits of multiple years of trade studies by many individu - als,63 at least one unwanted characteristic remains. The K1 tidal alias is very nearly two  cycles per year, thus appearing close to geophysical signals associated with seasonal  effects. 
K1 cannot be ignored, as it is the largest diurnal constituent and is second in  magnitude only to the dominant lunar constituent. The constraint on the exactness of an orbit’s repeating ground track is determined to  first order by the fine structure in the local geoid expressed at the ocean’s surface.75 For  example, cross-track surface slopes (gradients) in the geoid may be as large as 2 × 10–4  near the deeper oceanic trenches. In such an extreme case, a cross-track drift of only  1 km would give rise to a 20-cm change in sea-surface height (SSH). 
In response, algo - rithms have been developed that correct SSH data for the effects of the larger cross- track geoid gradients. It also is standard practice to constrain an altimeter’s cross-track  drift to less than 1 km. Repeat tolerance usually is the condition that motivates active  orbit maintenance maneuvers. 
Non-Repeat Orbit.  The precedent for this is Geosat71; its first 18 months were  devoted to geodesy for which a non-repeat orbit is optimal. Geodetic missions map  gravity anomalies reflected in subtle local tilts of the mean ocean surface. 
These are  static mesoscale features of spatial scales less than about 300 km, determined by the  topographic features, composition of the sea bottom, and stationary oceanic currents.  Data from Geosat have been used to derive the standard bathymetric charts available  for the global oceans.72,80 Geosat ERM Orbit.  The only other family of dedicated missions is that in the  Geosat (1985–1989) Exact Repeat Mission (ERM) orbit, the same orbit used by  GFO. 
This orbit has a period of 17.0505 calendar days (sometimes inappropriately  ch18.indd   37 12/19/07   5:14:54 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

In particular, the dominant tidal constituent, the common twice-daily lunar  tide, is aliased to 317 days, which is close to the annual cycle.81 Precision orbit  determination is good to only about 7 cm, which is relatively large, due in no small  measure to failure of the primary onboard GPS navigation subsystem. Sun-Synchronous Orbits . 
Sun-synchronous satellites host European Space  Agency (ESA) altimeters on ERS-1, ERS-2, and RA-1 on ENVISAT. All share the  same orbit: 35.00 calendar days repeat period; 98.5 ° inclination; and 781-km mean  equatorial altitude. Radial knowledge of these sun-synchronous orbits is good to about  5 cm, based on the Delft model.82 As sun-synchronous altimeters, the largest solar  constituent (twice daily) aliases to zero, and all tidal constituents that are primarily  dependent on solar forces alias to frequencies close to zero. 
Theoretical Foundations.  The following paragraphs provide a summary of the  key characteristics of a space-based radar altimeter. Examples are drawn from the  design of TOPEX.83,84 Pulse-limited Altimeters. 
 Figure 18.10 illustrates the pulse-limited condition.85  The radius rP of the area delimited on a quasi-flat surface by a pulse of length t  sec- onds on the Earth of mean radius RE seen from a relative altitude of h kilometers is  r c hP R = τ α/ (18.16) where a R = (RE + h)/RE is a consequence of the spherical observation geometry. For  typical satellite radar altimeters, the pulse-limited footprint over a quasi-flat surface is  on the order of two kilometers in diameter. The pulse-limited area Ap is  A r c hP P R = =π π τ α2( ) / (18.17) As the pulse continues to impinge and spread over the surface, the resulting pulse- limited annuli all have areas equal to that of the initial pulse-limited footprint. 
Hence,  the received power tends to maintain the level corresponding to the peak of the initial  response (Figure 18.10). The pulse-limited areas expand in response to increasing  large-scale surface roughness, which in the oceanographic context is expressed as  significant wave height (SWH). The height accuracy of a pulse-limited altimeter is  much less sensitive to (small) angular pointing errors than is the case for a beam- limited altimeter. 
Adaptive Tracking.  A satellite-based radar altimeter needs to measure the dis - tance accurately, but only for an essentially planar surface, oriented orthogonally to  the radar’s line-of-sight. Conservative design suggests that the measurement should  be concentrated near the reflection from that surface. 
Hence, ocean-viewing altim - eters have a small range window whose position tracks the delay and strength of the  §  The Geosat ERM orbit was chosen for political as much as for technical reasons. It followed the Seasat orbit  (1978) that had established a well-known precedent.70 ch18.indd   38 12/19/07   5:14:59 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Radar backscatter is primarily specular, typically spanning 3 dB to 20 dB,  to cite parameters used in the testing of the TOPEX altimeter. 
In practice, range- gate delay and backscatter tracking are met with two servo-regulator feedback loops  (Figure 18.11). The first loop is a second-order height tracker consisting of range  position (alpha tracker) and range rate (beta tracker). The second loop is the receiver  gain control (AGC). 
Altimeter height measurement is given by the setting of the FIGURE 18.10  The pulse-limited condition: Over a nominally level flat  surface, the altimeter’s short pulse ( a) reflects first from an area that may be  much smaller than the footprint illuminated by the antenna pattern ( b).

Surface wind speed and significant wave  height63 are derived from the AGC values and the waveform’s shape, respectively. 
The precision of an individual height measurement is determined by the combination  of range resolution and incoherent waveform averaging. If a single simple short pulse  were transmitted, then the height resolution would equal the pulse length. The principal  disadvantage of a short pulse is that it contains little energy. 
The inherent resolution of a  pulse is inversely proportional to its bandwidth. Space-based radar altimeters use some  form of modulation on the transmitted signal to maintain a large bandwidth within a  longer pulse, thus increasing the transmitted energy at no loss of resolution. Deramp on Receive. 
 Satellite-based radar altimeters present an elegant embodi - ment of the Stretch technique,86 which is known as full deramp  in the field of space- based radar altimetry. This method was first employed by MacArthur in the Seasat  altimeter,70 and has been adopted as the standard technique since then for this type of  radar. The distinguishing feature of this technique is a clever trade between the two key FIGURE 8.11  A generic signal flow diagram for an ocean-viewing  radar altimeter.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.416x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 parameters in a large time-bandwidth product (TBP) signal. After reception, demodu - lation is applied that transforms the “short time, large bandwidth” nature of the origi - nal pulse to “long time, small bandwidth” signals. Since the same TBP is maintained,  the original resolution is preserved. 
The method is ideal for altimetry, since the range  depth of the ocean’s surface is very much smaller than the time available in the pulse  repetition period. Clearly, the full deramp technique offers a considerable savings in  system bandwidth at all subsequent stages and at no cost in range resolution. The fig - ures cited in Table 18.5 show that the ratio of waveform bandwidth to RF bandwidth  for TOPEX is on the order of 0.05%. 
The TOPEX altimeter design is described more  completely in the open literature.83,84 Geosat: Geodetic Mission.  Radar altimetric data are the basis for state-of- the-art gravimetric variations expressed at the ocean’s surface, and consequently,  oceanic bathymetry.* The principal objective of a geodetic satellite radar altimeter73  is to measure the (along-track) slope of the sea surface caused by gravity deflections  over spatial scales less than a few hundreds of kilometers (Figure 18.12). These  slopes are derived from the SSH measurements summarized above, but this applica - tion has its own unique implications for system design. 
The highlights are reviewed  in the following paragraphs. Sea-surface slope87 is derived by taking the difference between two neighboring  height measurements, where the slope tangent equals “rise over run.” The key word  for these measurements is precision : the standard deviation (noise) of the sea-surface  height measurement about its mean value. Height measurement precision is deter - mined by the radar altimeter’s post-processing range resolution and by the amount  of averaging available for each estimate. 
Note that a precision measurement may still  have poor accuracy, if its mean value is biased away from the correct value. When  comparing two neighboring height measurements, any constant bias is cancelled by  subtraction as long as the error is the same for both measurements. The sea-surface  slope measurement problem is challenging because the desired slope signals are as  small as one microradian, equivalent to a 6 mm height differential (rise) for each 6 km  along-track separation (run). 
In addition to height precision, geodetic altimetry requires smaller along-track  resolution than a conventional altimeter and an orbit that accumulates dense cross- track coverage. The altimeter’s footprint resolution should be smaller than about 6 km,   *  Literally, measurement of the distance between the mean ocean surface and the local sea floor.FIGURE 18.12  When averaged and stripped of  dynamic (current-driven) features, the mean ocean  surface is a direct expression of the local gravity gra - dient.

18.42  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 which corresponds to the minimum half-wavelength scale of the observable pertur - bations in the ocean’s mean surface due to spatial variations in the Earth’s gravity.  The orbit should not repeat for ∼1.2 years to yield an average ground track spac - ing of 6 km, again in respect of the gravity signal at the ocean’s surface. The orbit’s  inclination should be near 50 °–63° to resolve north and east slopes nearly equally  and to cover the lower latitudes where existing data are inadequate. 
Note that oceano - graphic radar altimeter missions (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, ERS1/2, ENVISAT, and  Geosat ERM/GFO) are normally placed into exact-repeat orbits (10 to 35 days), and  as a consequence, have widely spaced (80 km to 315 km) ground tracks. Such orbits   cannot resolve the short-wavelength two-dimensional surface slopes required for use - ful geodesy. Since absolute height accuracy is not required, geodetic radar altimeters can be  relatively basic instruments.88 They do not need to compensate for propagation delays;  hence they need only one frequency, and they do not necessarily need a water vapor  radiometer (WVR). 
Indeed, a simple instrument is preferred; it has been shown that  efforts to correct for path delays usually add noise to slope estimates.89 Geodetic mea - surements provided by the Geosat and ERS-1 (both single-frequency altimeters with  no WVR) furnished the best resolution oceanic geodesy and bathymetry available up  through at least 2010 for the open ocean. Their resulting bathymetric resolution is lim - ited to about 25 km north-south and poorer resolution of east-west slope components.  These results reflect the less-than-optimum resolution, waveform precision, and orbit  inclination of those two altimeters. 
Geodetic resolution at the ocean’s surface can be  no finer than about 6 km (half a wavelength), a limit that is determined by the average  depth of the ocean. CryoSat: Ice Sheet Mission.  Pulse-limited space-based radar altimeters work  best over relatively mild topographic relief of mean slope zero, such as the ocean’s  surface. 
Over ice sheets or terrestrial surfaces, performance is degraded. Unwanted  characteristics include footprint dilation over rougher terrain, height errors in propor - tion to surface mean slope, and the tendency of the minimum range measurement to  hop from one elevated region to another (without the control or knowledge of the data  analyst). Beam-limited techniques, of which laser altimeters are extreme examples,  circumvent these problems, but may imply their own set of disadvantages. 
A major potential application of radar altimetry is to monitor the height of extensive  ice sheets, as found in Greenland or Antarctica. Approximately 95% of these land-ice  surfaces have slopes less than ∼3°, which, although small, is sufficient to trick a con - ventional altimeter into very large height errors. For example, an unknown 1 ° slope  would lead to a 120-m surface height error, which is unacceptable if cm-level inter- annual changes are the objective. 
The CryoSat altimeter90 is the first space-based radar altimeter designed to oper - ate over ice (Figure 18.13). Its payload instrument is the SAR/Interferometric Radar  ALtimeter (SIRAL), which has three modes: Conventional, SAR, and Interferometric.  The Conventional mode (pulse-limited, described in the forgoing paragraphs) reflects  its Poseidon heritage. 
The SAR mode is based on the delay-doppler architecture,91  which offers advantages in precision, resolution, and along-track surface slope toler - ance. The Interferometric mode92 is designed to measure the cross-track surface slope  component. Both of these advanced altimeter modes have been demonstrated with the  D2P airborne altimeter.93 Unlike previous radar altimeter missions, CryoSat will downlink all altimetric  data with essentially no onboard processing. 
Data from each of the three modes are  ch18.indd   42 12/19/07   5:15:03 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

The conventional mode is used for the  open ocean (for calibration and sea-surface height reference purposes) and the central  continental ice sheets that are relatively level. The interferometric mode is reserved  for the more steeply sloping margins of the ice sheets. 
The synthetic aperture mode  is used primarily over sea ice, where its sharper spatial resolution and precision sup - port measuring the difference between the sea level and the top surface of floating  ice (freeboard). Because the density of ice is relatively well-known, such freeboard  measurements can be inverted to estimate ice thickness.94 18.4 PLANETARY RADARS The history of planetary imaging radars is summarized in Table 18.6. Venus has been  the most popular destination,95 largely because it is cloud-covered (hence its surface is  not observable by optical means), its mass and size are similar to those of Earth, and  spectral observations have shown that its atmosphere is ∼98% CO2, suggesting that a  greenhouse effect could have overwhelmed what might have been a more hospitable  planet. 
A popular theme for planetary exploration by radar is the search for evidence  of water (especially water-ice).96,97 Data from radar missions are available through  NASA’s Planetary Data System.98 Flight Systems.  Venera-8  performed the first simple radar measurements of  Venus from a spacecraft. Venera-8  carried a pulse-modulated radar altimeter, which  returned 35 readings during its descent from orbit to its demise on the surface of Venus. 
 FIGURE 18.13  The CryoSat satellite and its SIRAL altimeter: The  two antennas (Interferometric mode) are athwart the velocity vector,  so that the differential phase (modulo 2 p  ) of the first return indicates  the cross-track position of the minimum-range reflecting surface,  which, in effect, is a measure of the cross-track component of the  mean surface gradient.

Readings span a vertical range of 45.5 km down  to 0.9 km, during which time the capsule drifted horizontally for a distance of about  60 km. 
Analysis of the return pulses yielded estimates of elevation variations of the  over-flown surface. Venera-9/10  (1975) demonstrated the first bistatic planetary radar  observations. The Venera-9/10  orbiters mapped 55 strips of the surface of Venus, rang - ing from 400–1200 km long and 100–200 km wide. 
A 32-cm wavelength radio wave  was beamed at the surface by the telemetry antenna, and both the direct and reflected  signals were recorded by Earth-based receivers. The first analysis of these data gave  one-dimensional measurements of terrain shape, with a resolution of 20–80 km. Pioneer Venus  was host to 17 experiments (with a total mass of 45 kg), including a  radar altimeter (ORAD), which also produced rudimentary surface maps as the radar  beam was scanned in the plane orthogonal to the orbit by the spacecraft’s 5 RPM spin- stabilization. 
The radar package required an average 18 W input power and had a mass  of 9.7 kg. Peak transmitted power was 20 W. The X band and S band communications  system used a despun antenna ( ∼1 m diameter dish). 
The radar altimeter provided many  years of data with a height accuracy of 150 m, which was the best available information  on Venus’ surface figure until Magellan . The altimeter’s waveform strength and shape  were analyzed to estimate surface electrical conductivity and meter-scale roughness  properties.99 The spacecraft’s 24-hour orbit was highly elliptical ( ∼200 km periapsis  and ∼22,900 km apoapsis†  for most of the mission). Radar data were collected only  below 4700 km altitudes, with a resolved footprint on the surface of 23 km along track  and 7 km across track.TABLE 18.6  Planetary Radars Mission URL Planet Year Radar Venera -8;9/10 (USSR) 1 Venus 1972, 75 Radar altimetry Pioneer Venus Orbiter  (PVO) (USA)2 Venus 1978–92 ORAD: Altimeter (also coarse imagery);  17 cm Venera 15/16 (USSR) 3 Venus 1983–84 SAR and altimeter; 8-cm wavelength Magellan (USA) 4 Venus 1990–94 SAR: 12.6 cm (125 m, 75 m pixels), 95%  coverage Clementine (USA) 5 Moon 1994 Bistatic scatterometer experiment; 6 cm Cassini (USA) 6 Titan 2004 TRM: 2 cm, SAR (resolution 0.35–1.7 km)  and altimeter Chandrayaan-1 (India) 7 Moon 2008 Forerunner Mini-RF (USA): 12-cm SAR,  scatterometer Lunar Reconnaissance  Orbiter LRO (USA)8 Moon 2008 Mini-RF: SAR (12 cm and 4 cm), imager  and interferometer 1.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.456x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 Venera 15/16 , simultaneous “twin” missions, were the first space-based SAR map - pers of another planet. 
They imaged the area from the north pole down to about 30 °N  latitude over 8 months of operations.100 Their radars had two modes, imaging and altim - etry, operating at 8-cm wavelengths. Imaging resolution was ∼1 km. Each 4000 kg  spacecraft was a cylinder 5 m in length. 
The synthetic aperture radar antenna was a  6 × 1.4 meter parabolic cylinder reflector, powered by an 80-watt traveling wave tube  amplifier. Rather than pulse or chirp modulation, Venera  used a continuous transmission  modulated by a coded sequence of 180 ° phase shifts. The received signal was digitized  into 2540 complex numbers (4 bits I, 4 bits Q). 
A radar look was taken every 0.3 seconds  and stored in a RAM memory buffer. To keep up with this data rate, recording alternated  between two onboard tape recorders. Data were downlinked each orbit ( ∼9 MBytes)  and then processed in ground-based facilities. 
Each imaging pass generated 3200 radar  images that were combined into a survey strip of 120 km wide by 7500 km long. These  were subsequently combined into mosaics. The spacecraft included a 1-m diameter para - bolic dish antenna for the radar altimeter. 
After the orbits were accurately determined,  the altimeters were switched to high-resolution mode. A 31-element phase modulation  was used, with a height ambiguity of 7.15 km. In later phases of processing, doppler  frequency analysis narrowed the effective footprint to 10 km by 40 km. 
The altimeter  operations (interleaved with those of the imager) resulted in the first radar altimetric map  (of the northern 1/3) of Venus comprised of more than 400,000 individual measurements.  The communications system used a dedicated 2.6 m radio dish antenna. The Venera  spacecraft were in approximately ∼24-hour polar orbits with a periapsis ∼1000 km,   at 62 °N latitude, and apoapsis ∼65,000 km. 
Magellan  mapped over 98% of the surface of Venus (Figure 18.14) with imag - ing resolution an order of magnitude better than the earlier Venera  missions.101  FIGURE 18.14  The impact crater Golubkina on the surface of Venus imaged  by Magellan  (S band, HH-polarized). The 30 km (19 mile) diameter crater is  characterized by terraced inner walls and a central peak, typical of large impact  craters on Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Rough ejecta give rise to strong radar  return, a blessing for those interested in planetary geology.

18.46  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 Altimetry and radiometry data also measured the surface topography and electri - cal characteristics. Magellan ’s elliptical orbit was inclined at 86 °, which allowed  virtually full access to the surface by the side-looking SAR. By the end of the mis - sion, Magellan  had returned more data than all prior planetary missions combined. 
 The radar operated in three modes—imager, altimeter, and radiometer—interleaved  during each pass.102 The X band data downlink supported data rates of 268 kbit/s or  115 kbit/s. The 3.7-m diameter high-gain antenna was used for both the radar and  for telecommunications. Spacecraft mass was 1035 kg; the radar mass was 335 kg. 
 Input power was 210 W at 28 VDC. Magellan  operated at S band (2.385 Ghz),  radiating a peak power of 325 W. Nominal pulse length was 26.5 µsec, with PRF  (4400 Hz–5800 Hz) selectable to accommodate the wide variations in range and  incidence necessitated by the elliptical orbit. 
It achieved 150-m resolution in SAR  mapping mode, 30-m height resolution in altimeter mode, and 2 °C in radiometer  mode. All Magellan  data are available through the Planetary Data System.98 Cassini , a multimode radar mapper103 leveraged from Magellan ’s heritage, was  included in the 12-instrument payload of the Cassini-Huygens Mission, which was  launched in October 1997 and started its four-year tour of Saturn and its moons in  July 2004. The motivation for the Cassini  mapper was the same as that for Magellan ,  namely, to make measurements of the surface of Titan through its dense cloud cover. 
 During its extensive tour of the Saturnian system, the Cassini-Huygens mission was  to complete 35 flybys of Titan, of which 29 will be at the closest approach of less than  4000 km, of which 15 will have minimum altitudes of ∼1000 km. The first close flyby  was in November 2004, from which the first radar images of the surface were col - lected. The radar antenna uses the 3.66 m H-polarized high-gain telecommunications  antenna, a strategy similar to that pioneered on Magellan . 
Seven beams, each at dif - ferent frequency, width, and boresight orientation, are required to support multiplexed  altimetry and scatterometry as well as imaging and radiometry. The radar’s mass is  ∼ 40 kg, and its input power requirement is ∼110 W. Peak data rates are on the order  of 360 kbit/s. 
All modes operate at Ku band (13.8 GHz). In its most favorable lower  altitude imaging geometry, ground range and azimuth resolutions are on the order of  0.5 km, at 4 looks. At higher altitudes, more looks are gathered to partially offset the  degraded resolution. 
The radar’s noise-equivalent s  0 ranges from ∼ −25 dB at low  altitude, to ∼ −8 dB at 4000 km altitude. In contrast to the scheme used on Magellan ,  smaller angles of incidence and lower bandwidth are used for the higher altitudes. The  lower bandwidth helps to reduce the mean noise level, whereas the shallower incident  angle helps to maintain range resolution with smaller radiated pulse bandwidth. 
Clementine , one of the first “faster better cheaper” missions, had primary objectives  including laser altimetry and optical surface mapping of the Moon as well as technol - ogy demonstration. The main payload instrumentation was comprised of four optical  cameras, including one with a laser altimeter. Major new information about the Moon  was provided from Clementine ’s data collected during its 71 days in lunar orbit. 
Clementine  is relevant to this chapter because of a unique bistatic radar experiment  conducted with the S band (13.19 cm) RF data system. The lunar south pole was illu - minated by Clementine ’s communications antenna (6 watts, circularly polarized), and  the reflections from the specular point were tracked by an antenna of the Deep Space  Network (DSN) over four passes. The observed reflected signal characteristics were  consistent with normal lunar regolith‡ on three passes, but data from the fourth pass  ‡  Found virtually everywhere on the Moon’s surface, regolith  is a layer of granular rocky material covering   solid rock.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.476x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 seemed to show an enhanced strength that corresponded to the specular point pass - ing across the floor of the crater Shackelton.104 Such enhanced reflections, especially  in the “unexpected” sense of circular polarization, are indicative of volumetric radar  response from very cold frozen volatiles such as water-ice,105 best illustrated by Earth- based radar observations of Jupiter’s icy moons. The subsequent claim that water-ice  had been discovered at the Moon precipitated wide interest. When independent analy - ses of the Clementine  data failed to reproduce the original result,106,107 considerable  controversy was generated as well. 
Discovery and/or verification of polar ice deposits  on the Moon emerged as a major objective of NASA’s exploration program,108 and if  proven, would be an essential resource for habitable outposts at the Moon. Radar Exploration for Planetary Ice.  V olumetric ice gives rise to two unusual  radar responses. 
When illuminated by a circularly polarized field, the predominant  backscatter from most natural surfaces has the opposite sense of circular polarization.  In the case of volumetric ice, however, the backscatter has the same sense of circu - lar polarization. The classical measure of this effect is the circular-polarization ratio  (CPR), sSC /sOC , or “same sense over opposite sense” circularly polarized backscatter  strengths.97 The total reflected power from volumetric ice is relatively strong, at least  for “clean” deposits. 
Both the polarization and radar brightness effects are explained  by the coherent opposition backscatter effect109 (COBE). Water-ice was predicted many years ago to have accumulated over some two billion  years in the floor of lunar craters or other features whose depth and latitude kept them  in permanent solar shadow. The only source of heat for those regions would be back - ground starlight and energy from the Moon’s interior, so that the ambient temperature  would be no more than ∼75 K. 
As water-ice enters such a cold space from comets, it  accumulates. This process generally is accepted as an explanation of the radar-bright  response from Mercury’s polar craters, for example, as observed by Earth-based radar  telescopes. Due to the small axial tilt of the Moon, however, radar telescopes such as  Arecibo have no similar opportunity to explore the floors of the lunar polar craters. 
The problem is that relatively large CPR is not unique to volumetric ice deposits.  Dihedral (two-dimensional) corners also reflect most strongly in the same sense as the  incident circular polarization. Naturally occurring dihedrals, such as rough rock for - mations created by a large impact, could generate false water-ice signatures. 
To reduce  the potential ambiguity of CPR and brightness measurements, the radar observations  must be repeatable and should be correlated with other indicators. Chandrayaan-1 and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)  include in each of  their payloads a “Mini-RF” radar.110 The version for Chandrayaan-1 is at S-band (12-cm  wavelength), with 150-m resolution at 16 looks. The Mini-RF for LRO has two frequen - cies, S band (12 cm) and X band (4 cm), and two resolutions, 150 m at 16 looks, and  15 m at 8 looks. 
The LRO radar also includes an interferometric mode, which requires  a continuous PRF, in contrast to the burst plan used for the other modes. Both have  moderate incident angles ( ∼45 degrees), moderate swath widths (4 km to 8 km), and  operate from low altitudes (100 km and 50 km, respectively). Given the applicable small  range-velocity product (Table 18.1), the antenna area needs to be only ∼ 1 m2 to satisfy  the minimum area constraint (Eq. 
18.4). These radars are indeed low mass, at about 8 kg  and 12 kg, respectively, including in each case their antenna. A major objective for both of these radars is to look for evidence of ice deposits  in the permanently shadowed areas of the Moon’s polar regions. 
This requires that  they must measure the circular polarization ratio (CPR). Hence, they transmit circular  polarization, and they are dual-polarized on receive. Their antennas are comprised  of passive arrays of H- and V-polarized elements, driven simultaneously 90 ° out of  ch18.indd   47 12/19/07   5:15:06 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

The received  linear polarizations are maintained through the remainder of the system to the image  processor output products. This results in the hybrid-polarity architecture111 that is  outlined below. Magellan: Innovative Venus Mapper. 
 Magellan (Figure 18.15) had to face up  to two driving mission restraints: cost and data rate. The first was set by NASA and the  U.S. government budget authorities. 
The second was set by physics, conditional upon  the data-rate capabilities of the Deep Space Network.112 The lesson, of course, is that  it is not enough to do good (read “big budget, SBR-based”) science, it must be done  efficiently and relatively patiently. In the case of Magellan , however, these top-level  restraints motivated a superb innovative radar design. Cost. 
 There were several consequences to the severe reduction in approved  funds relative to funds requested for the original Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar  (VOIR) mission. Rather than a conventional circular orbit, Magellan  was redesigned  for an elliptical orbit (Figure 18.16), which had considerably less associated costs  and risk. Also, rather than the original large high-aspect-ratio antenna typical of  space-based SARs, Magellan  was obliged to use a spare circular communications  antenna left over from a previous mission. 
Whereas these may sound like benign  if not trivial modifications, they necessitated paradigm-shifting innovations by the  SAR design team. Antenna . The key element in any space-based SAR design is the antenna. 
It  determines range swath coverage and required minimum transmitter power, and has a  major influence on resolution and data rate. The Magellan antenna, a 3.7-m diameter  dish, was a significant departure from the conventional highly asymmetric rectangular  antennas that were then in favor for SARs.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.496x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 The vertical dimension of the antenna (together with range, incidence, and wave - length) determined the width of the illuminated swath on the surface. 
This provided an  upper bound on the imaged swath width, which, in the case of Magellan , was less than  the swath actually illuminated. The imaged swath width was chosen to be somewhat  wider than the orbit-to-orbit translation of Venus’ surface due to planet rotation. The  period of the elliptical orbit was selected to be about three hours, so that in succession  each imaging pass overlapped and extended the surface imaged on previous passes. 
In the along-track direction, the antenna size had far-reaching consequences. The  theoretical (single-look) azimuth resolution available from the Magellan  antenna could  be about 1.6 meters (Section 18.2). This is on the order of 75 times smaller than the sci - ence requirement of 120 meters azimuth resolution. 
It followed that single-look 120-m  data could be collected by operating the radar only 1/75 of the time. If NL looks were  required, then the implied operating duty factor would be NL/75, larger by a factor of  NL. The result is the burst mode (Section 18.2), in which the radar operates at much less  than 100% of the time. 
Burst mode is a standard strategy for SARs designed to explore  the Moon or other planetary bodies, using antennas whose along-track dimension is  much smaller than the azimuth resolution required of the data. The looks parameter NL  deserves special comment in the SBR context, summarized below. The Magellan  antenna was used as the high-gain antenna for data downlink as  well as for the SAR. 
During the high-altitude segment of each orbit, the spacecraft  was oriented to point the antenna toward Earth. The antenna had two feeds, one at S  band (HH-polarization for the radar) and X band (circular-polarization for telemetry).  After each pole-to-pole data collection, the telemetry transferred the accumulated data  to one of the three Deep Space Network (DSN) receiving stations, so that, in conse - quence, the data dump kept pace with the data take, per orbit. 
Orbit.  For reasons directly attributable to principles of orbital mechanics, it was  much less costly to go into an elliptical orbit at Venus rather than a circular one. The  fact that it would be considerably more difficult to get decent imagery successfully FIGURE 18.16  Details of Magellan ’s elliptical orbit, dominated by ∼37 minutes of  data take and 2 hours of data downlink during each 3.3-hour orbit period ( Graphic  courtesy of NASA ) ch18.indd   49 12/19/07   5:15:07 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Space-Based Remote Sensing Radars. 18.50  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 from an elliptical orbit was of little concern to the budget-masters, although the ellip - tical orbit constraint attracted more than a little attention from the SAR design team. 
 The Magellan  radar had to adapt to variations in relative altitude from approximately  250 km (near the equator) to more than 2000 km (over the poles). Quite reasonably  one might expect that the resulting imagery—let alone the implied timing and scal - ing issues—would suffer as a consequence. Thanks to the mission design, however,  Magellan  image quality is surprisingly consistent, pole to pole. 
The reasons provide  an important object lesson. Since the Magellan radar was operated in burst mode, it was convenient (as well  as necessary) prior to each burst to set the mode parameters, which, in general, varied  from burst to burst. Critical parameters included PRF, range gate, burst length, burst  period, and spacecraft roll. 
The parameter files were prepared in advance, based on the  data collection geometry, and turned into commands to be generated by the radar map - ping sequencing software. The result was a set of about 1000 unique configurations,  each tied to specific segments of the orbit. In operation, suitable commands were pre - loaded into the onboard SAR control processor for each three-day mapping interval. 
In order to offset the tenfold altitude change on SAR image quality, the SAR oper - ating profile was designed to exploit a variety of incident angles. At the start of each  imaging pass at high altitude, the incidence was slewed from steep near the pole,  to shallow in the neighborhood of the equator, back to steep when approaching the  opposite pole. This incidence variation helped to offset the large change in radar range  to the imaged swath, but it meant also that the range resolution as expressed on the  surface varied as a function of latitude. 
For a constant radar bandwidth, the effec - tive surface range resolution at shallower incidence is improved over that achieved at  steeper incidence. Fortunately, at steeper incidence, and hence at longer ranges, there  was more time available to gather more looks. Image Quality . 
Looks and resolution work together to determine the image qual - ity (read “geophysical information potential”) of SAR imagery over natural terrain  composed of distributed scatterers. The governing expression is the SAR image qual - ity parameter31,113  QN r rL SAR RgAz=  (18.18) where NL is the number of (statistically independent) looks, and rRg and rAz are the  range and azimuth resolution, respectively, on the surface. Here the important general - izable lesson is that an increase in number of looks can be applied to offset a decrease  in range resolution (within reason and in this kind of exploratory space-based SAR  data). 
Note that both looks and resolution require support in bandwidth. It follows  that QSAR is proportional to the product of the range and azimuth bandwidths, hence  proportional to the (two-dimensional) information capacity of the radar in the Shannon  sense. This principle was applied with great profit to the Magellan  SAR design,114  as illustrated by Table 18.7. 
From that table, one can verify that the image quality of  Magellan  data varied by no more than ∼±2% pole to pole, in spite of large variations  in radar range, incident angle, and ground range resolution. Data Rate . Magellan  SAR data were relayed from Venus to Earth via the DSN. 
 This major communication system imposed a working limit of about 270 kbit/s on  the SAR data telemetry. Whereas this may seem rather large, it is minuscule by  ch18.indd   50 12/19/07   5:15:10 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.516x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 space-based SAR standards. For example, the digital data rate for the ERS-1/2 and  RADARSAT Earth-observing SARs is on the order of 120 Mbit/s. 
Newer designs  claim up to 400 Mbit/s. Since the Magellan  objective was to image a substantial por - tion of the surface of the entire planet at 120-m resolution within the length of the  primary mission, the DSN data-rate capability emerged as the toughest requirement  on the entire system. Raw SAR data rate is proportional to the image quality factor, swath width, space - craft velocity, and the number of digital bits per data sample. 
Of course, mean data  rate can be relaxed if the data from any given pass can be collected and then played  back at a slower rate. Although this strategy was exploited by the Magellan  design,  tolerance for which was set up by the elliptical orbit, it was not sufficient to solve the  limited data-rate problem. The only degree of freedom remaining in the data-rate budget was the number of  bits retained for each sample in the raw SAR datastream. 
Working back through the  DSN constraint, it turned out that there were only two bits available for Magellan ’s  raw SAR data. Yes—a 2-bit SAR! And again, the unique characteristics of an orbital SAR made  this an acceptable solution for the Magellan  design. The key requirements for this  paradigm are two: (1) an effective signal encoding that is very large and (2) an imag - ing environment that is dense and dominated by distributed random backscatter. 
 Planetary SARs (and many Earth-observing space-based radars) easily satisfy these  requirements. One measure of an imaging radar’s extensive signal encoding is the  product of its range and azimuth time-bandwidth products, or equivalently, its poten - tial two-dimensional compression ratio. In the case of SAR data, this ratio is given  by the area of the instantaneous pulse footprint (antenna width by projected pulse  length) divided by the resolved cell area (the product of azimuth and range resolu - tion). 
This ratio varied by mode for Magellan , but, in general, was well in excess of  10,000, which turns into a gain in dynamic range from the signal domain to the image  domain of 40 dB. The “2-bit method” was based on a Block-Adaptive Quantizer115 (BAQ). This in  effect implemented an automatic gain control (AGC) that selected the most influential  digital samples (bits) from the raw SAR datastream. 
As designed for Magellan , the  data were digitized into 8 bits, in-phase and quadrature (I&Q). The analog-to-digital  stage was followed by the BAQ operation, which selected the two most significant bits  in each (I&Q) data pair, relative to a mean signal level that had been established from  the previous burst of received data. The mean signal level varied very slowly burst  to burst since adjacent bursts covered essentially the same scene elements. 
The mean  signal level (AGC setting) was included in the header for each burst’s data record to  be used in subsequent SAR image formation.TABLE 18.7  Image Quality: Magellan Resolution and Looks Altitude (km)Incidence  (degrees) rR (m) rA (m) Looks NL QSAR NL/(rR rA)   250 52 110 122 4.8 3.6 ×10–4   500 39 137 121 6.0 3.6 ×10–4   1000 28 181 121 8.5 3.9 ×10–4   1750 21 247 120 11.6 3.9 ×10–4   2100 19 270 120 13.5 4.0 ×10–4 ch18.indd   51 12/19/07   5:15:10 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

18.52  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 Although the dynamic range of the raw SAR data out of a BAQ operator is severely  limited, the potential dynamic range of the resulting image data is much larger: it is  bounded above by the product of the input dynamic range and the two-dimensional  compression ratio of the SAR data. Thus, the dynamic range capacity after processing  for Magellan  imagery was in excess of 40 dB. This was well illustrated in the many  thousands of image frames formed from Magellan ’s SAR data. 
Hybrid-polarity Architecture.  A leading high-level objective of a radar des - tined for the Moon, Mars, or any other planetary body is to maximize its measurement  potential, while also minimizing its resource demands (principally power and mass). If  sensitivity to frozen volatiles is a requirement levied on a planetary exploratory radar,  then the system should be dual-polarized and must transmit circular polarization. 
As  reviewed in Section 18.2, a dual-polarized radar maximizes its measurement capabili - ties only if it retains the relative phase as well as the magnitudes of the two received  amplitudes, such as EH and EV in the linear polarization basis. It has been known since  1852 that a quasi-monochromatic EM field can be fully characterized by the four Stokes  parameters.116 In terms of linearly polarized received data, the Stokes parameters are   S E E S E E S E E SH V H V H V12 2 22 2 3 42= + = − = = −| | | | | | | | Re* 2 2Im*E EH V (18.19) where * denotes complex conjugate, and the carats < > indicate an average taken over  several samples. Clearly, the relative phase between the two polarizations is an essential  factor for two of the four Stokes parameters. 
Data expressed through the Stokes param - eters are well-suited to being exploited by matrix decomposition methodology.60,117 For a given transmitted polarization, the values of these Stokes parameters are  invariant with respect to the polarization basis of the receiver. It follows that the opti - mum architecture is hybrid-polarity118: circularly polarized on transmit and linearly  dual-polarized on receive (Figure 18.17). This architecture requires less mass and  offers greater efficiency than alternatives, while capturing all of the potential informa - tion in the backscattered field. 
An antenna comprised of two linear arrays (such as H and V) will radiate a circularly  polarized field if the sets of elements are driven simultaneously and 90 ° out of phase,  as shown in Figure 18.17. In practice, the amplitude weighting and relative phasing  of the arrays will seldom be perfect. As a result, the radiated field will be somewhat  elliptical, rather than purely circular. 
The hybrid-polarity architecture is self-calibrating  and, therefore, relatively robust in response to such imperfections. In brief, under the  condition that s  0 HH = s  0 VV, the mean signal level in the two receive channels should be  equal. (In terms of the Stokes parameters, S2 = 0). 
The H and V backscatter coefficients  will always be equivalent when the radar’s illumination is perpendicular to the surface.  Hence, any hybrid-polarity radar can set up this condition by the simple expedient of  looking down on a horizontal surface during a calibration exercise. Discrepancies in  either amplitude or phase will be evident from such data collected over a random dis - tributed scene. 
There is no need for a known point-target reference in the field of view.  The Stokes parameters that correspond to such measurements are sufficient to charac - terize the relative H/V phase of the transmitted field, as well as that of the receivers. ch18.indd   52 12/19/07   5:15:13 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.536x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 18.5 SCATTEROMETERS Space-based remote sensing scatterometers measure the normalized backscatter with  sufficient precision and accuracy to deduce the value of one or more parameters of  geophysical significance. 
For example, the power reflected from the ocean back to a  radar is a function of surface roughness at the scale of the radar’s wavelength, which,  in turn, is a function of the local wind.119 Estimation of wind speed and direction over  the open ocean is the most common application for these instruments. A wind scat - terometer was adopted by EUMETSAT in the early 2000s as a required operational  capability, with operational accuracies of ±2 m/s in wind speed and ±20° in direction.  In addition to open ocean observations, calibrated data from this class of SBR have  been applied to a variety of large-area surface features, such as determination of sea  ice coverage, mapping the boundaries between the principal ice zones of Greenland,  or global estimation of tropical deforestation. 
In all such applications, the emphasis is  on measurement of mean reflectivity over large areas, rather than mapping fine spatial  detail. These radars typically have resolutions on the scale of 10s of kilometers, sup - ported over swaths of 1000 kilometers or more. In the ocean application, relatively small changes in radar backscatter may cor - respond to substantial differences in the retrieved wind information.§120,121 It follows  that the dominant requirement for this class of radar is the accuracy and precision   of the received power measurement.* However, the next step, vector wind retrievals—   transforming the radar backscattered power into accurate estimates of wind speed  and direction—is far from trivial. 
Indeed, the technique fails for the very low  wind speeds that do not generate wavelength-scale surface roughness. In the limit,  FIGURE 18.17  The hybrid-polarity SAR architecture first used by the Mini-RF lunar radars on  Chandrayaan-1  and LRO Transmitter & waveform H Receive V Receive90° HTiming and control Antenna VH|H| |V|HV* H V *XH Processor V Processo rV §  http://www.eumetsat.int/groups/ops/documents/document/pdf_tm03_rev-scatterometer-w.pdf *  Note that both accuracy and precision are required. Radar backscatter by its very nature is a quantity having a large  standard deviation that can be reduced only by extensive averaging. 
Because the geophysical interpretation of scat - terometric data often depends on distinguishing between two similar values of s  0, the results depend critically on  reducing the uncertainty in the estimated value as well as getting the average value right. ch18.indd   53 12/19/07   5:15:14 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Vector Wind Retrieval. 
 The normalized backscatter coefficient s  0 from a wind- roughened oceanic surface depends foremost on the radar’s wavelength, the local angle  of incidence, and the polarization, respectively. The wind parameters to be estimated  are its speed, the relative angle in the horizontal plane between the wind direction,  and the radar line-of-sight. The ocean’s reflectivity is also a function of other factors,  including surfactants (such as oil slicks, either natural or anthropogenic), the air-sea  temperature difference, or the presence of large waves such as oceanic swell, but these  are of less significance for the present discussion. 
The reflection coefficient s  0 is nonlinear with respect to the wind parameters.  Figure 18.18 illustrates the response for one polarization, where the horizontal axis  is the relative wind direction, and the vertical axis is the normalized radar cross sec - tion. The several curves each correspond to a specific wind speed. 
In general, upwind  and downwind aspects provide stronger backscatter than cross-wind, and the upwind  aspect usually is a bit stronger than downwind. Wind vector data have been collected  by airborne scatterometers flying in circles (literally!) over instrumented test sites.122  There have been many attempts over the years to converge on a suitable mathemati - cal model for this behavior, with reasonable success.123 There are several vector wind  retrieval methods in current use, including CMOD-4 and a neural network model. The data clearly show that measurement of radar backscatter at only one aspect  angle is not sufficient to determine wind speed and direction. 
The Seasat scatterometer  used two look angles (separated by 90 °), but the resulting retrievals had as many as  FIGURE 18.18  Typical backscatter strength (vertical axis) from a  wind-driven sea surface, as a function of wind speed (modeled data) and  the wind direction relative to the radar’s look direction (horizontal axis).  Similar families of curves correspond to the radar’s polarization (usually  HH or VV) and angle of incidence. Curves such as these are derived from  a model (such as CMOD4) subsequently verified by extensive airborne  measurements.

Measurement Precision.  Clearly, s  0 must be measured with an accuracy and  precision of less than 1 dB if useful wind retrievals are to be derived. 
Accuracy depends  on the radar’s stability and its calibration. The challenge for space-borne scatterometry  is to design the radar such that the precision—the normalized standard deviation of the  s  0 measurements—is sufficiently small. In the standard terminology of scatterometry,  the classical parameter is KP, the normalized standard deviation of the measurement.125  In the case of a fan-beam scatterometer that employs doppler filtering, the governing  expression is  KSNR SNR NTBP=+ +( / / ) 1 2 1 (18.20) where N is the number of statistically independent pulses summed into each s  0 mea - surement, T is the transmitted pulse length, B is the doppler bandwidth of the mea - surement cell, and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio. 
KP usually is cited as a percent,  where values of 5% or better are the objective. Note for high SNR that KP converges  to 1 /NTB. At lower wind speeds KP depends on SNR as well as on the number of  statistically independent looks. 
The details of any expression such as this depend on  the underlying statistical model, which is gaussian in this classic expression. However,  the general principle is that the scatterometer must provide many independent looks  to reduce the standard deviation of the s  0 measurement, regardless of the statistical  distribution of the ocean’s backscatter. Trends. 
 Vector wind data have been adopted by operational meteorological  agencies such as EUMETSAT. It is likely that space-based microwave assets will  continue to be used for the foreseeable future to provide these data. The success of  SeaWinds (discussed later in this section) suggests that the conical scan paradigm will  be the basis for future vector wind scatterometer design. 
That said, there are two space-based alternatives for measuring vector winds by  microwave means, active and passive. Radars often are unpopular on spacecraft that  host other instruments, of which some may be compromised by radio frequency inter - ference (RFI) generated by a nearby microwave transmitter. Radars also require more  power from their host spacecraft than passive systems. 
These and related consider - ations motivated the development of WindSat, a passive instrument that estimates  near-surface vector winds by Stokes parameter analysis of the microwave emissivity  from the ocean surface.126  WindSat is one of two instruments aboard the Coriolis  satel - lite, launched in 2003. The operational reliability of passive-vector wind data relative  to scatterometric measurements remains an open issue. Scatterometric data are being exploited for many purposes other than oceanic vec - tor winds. 
Although the “images” generated by a space-based scatterometer may have  only 50-km resolution, their wide swath and frequent revisit intervals are well suited to  synoptic coverage of global-scale phenomena. The multi-year history of scatteromet - ric radars provides an important data set for climate change studies as well as moni - toring seasonal variations. Suitable applications include sea ice cover, large icebergs,  continental ice sheets, vegetation, and soil moisture.127–130 ch18.indd   55 12/19/07   5:15:19 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 RadScat131 (Table 18.8) was the name given to the radiometer/ scatterometer portion of the S-193 Ku band instrument aboard Skylab. The top-level  objectives of this experiment were (1) to provide the near-simultaneous measurement  of microwave backscatter and emissivity of land and ocean on a global scale and   (2) to provide engineering data for use in designing space radar altimeters. The equip - ment shared a common gimbaled antenna. 
The scatterometer measured the normalized  backscatter coefficient of ocean and terrain as a function of incidence ranging from  0° to 48 °. Although only sparse coverage of selected sites was possible, the data were  sufficient to demonstrate the potential of space-based radar measurement of surface  wind vectors over the ocean. The S-193 zone of access was 48º forward and 48º to  either side of the spacecraft ground track. 
For selected measurements, the beam was  pointed in the along-track direction to fixed angles of 0º, 15.6º, 29.4º, 40.1º, and 48º,  with sufficient dwell time at each angle to permit averaging to achieve approximately  5% precision. RadScat data collected over the Amazon rain forest suggested that the  uniformity of the observed backscatter would be a stable calibration reference for  space-based radars, which has since been validated as a standard technique.132 SASS , the Seasat-A Satellite Scatterometer,133,134 was the first space-based radar  designed specifically to measure oceanic winds. It was a multi-fan-beam instrument,  comprised of two sets of two dual-polarized antennas (HH and VV), each ∼ 3-m in  length whose fan-shaped beams pointed to 45 ° and 135 ° to either side of the orbit  plane. 
Incidence spanned 25 ° to 55 °, covering a 500-km wide swath on each side.  Calibration data taken over the rain forest were used to reduce antenna gain uncer - tainty to less than 0.4 dB. Since Seasat was not yaw-steered, the fore and aft footprints  were misregistered due to Earth rotation, which reduced the useful swath at lower  latitudes to about 400 km. 
The value of Kp varied from 1% to 3% over the ocean under  moderate to high sea states, but degraded to 15% for lower wind speeds and to 50%  for very low backscatter from non-oceanic surfaces. The accuracies of wind speed  and direction over 4–16 m/s were ± 2 m/s and ± 20o, respectively. The data were not  sufficient to avoid directional ambiguities, however. 
Nominal resolution was 50 km,  determined by the intersection of the antenna pattern and iso-doppler contours. The  radar operated at 14.6 GHz, radiating a peak power of 100 W at 17% duty factor from  a traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA). The waveform was modulated CW. 
The  receiver front end was a tunnel diode amplifier, which maintained the noise figure to  be less than 5.7 dB at all operating temperatures. Mean input power was 136 W dc;  the instrument mass was 102 kg. TABLE 18.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.576x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 WS aboard the ERS-1 and ERS-2 spacecraft of ESA denotes the scatterometer mode  embedded in their C band AMI radar instrumentation.14 These scatterometers used three  fan-beam antennas, whose footprints were oriented at 45 °, 90°, and 135 ° with respect to  the satellite track. The two outer antennas are 3.6-m long. Note that the spacecraft had to  be yaw-steered to maintain this footprint geometry over the rotating Earth. 
The C band  operating frequency, although a departure from space-based precedent, resulted from  use of the same RF hardware as the SAR mode. As a consequence, simultaneous SAR  and scatterometer operations were not possible. In contrast to Ku band, the C band data  were less degraded by rain and proved to be more reliable for higher wind speeds.119  The antenna swaths spanned 500 km, from which the averaged data from the three-look  directions were colocated into 50-km resolution cells, posted on a 25-km grid. 
ASCAT , the Advanced Scatterometer135 aboard MetOp-1, is essentially an improved  version of the ERS-1/2 instruments. It is a stand-alone radar designed for operational  use; it does not have to time-share onboard electronics as was the case with the scat - terometer in the AMI suite. It covers swaths on both sides of the satellite ground track. 
 The near edge of these 500-km swaths are offset 384 km from nadir, spanning 25 °–– 65° incidence. The 0.57 dB radiometrically accurate data are averaged to achieve Kp  from 3% (high up-wind speed) to 10% (low speed, cross-wind aspect). The result - ing vectors for near-surface winds cover 4–24 m/s with accuracy ± 2 m/s and ± 20°. 
 The radar operates at 5.255 GHz, radiating 10 ms linear frequency-modulated (LFM)  pulses at 120 W peak power from combined GaAs FET devices. Only one antenna is  active (for 0.2 s) at a time; the operation cycles around the six antennas in sequence.  The instrument mass is 270 kg; input power required is 251 W. 
Thanks to onboard  processing, the inherent data rate is reduced from 1.4 Mbit/s to an average of 60 kbit/s  to the MetOp-1 payload data-handling system. NSCAT , the NASA Scatterometer,134 provided to Japan as part of the Advanced Earth  Observing Satellite (ADEOS) payload, was an upgraded version of SASS. NSCAT  used six dual-polarized stick antennas (3 m long), four of which were aimed at ± 45°  (H polarized) and ±135° (Vpolarized) from the surface track, and the two midbeam  antenna patterns were aligned at 65 ° and 115 ° (each H and V polarized). 
The third beam  on each side helped to remove the fourfold directional ambiguities that plagued SASS  wind retrievals. Two 600-km wide swaths were covered, at 25-km resolution. In order  to support 25-km along-track resolution, the radar’s sequencer had to cycle through all  antenna patterns within 3.74 s, resulting in a maximum dwell time of 470 ms within  each of the eight footprints. 
Cross-beam resolution was determined by doppler analysis.  However, since the mean doppler offset was a function of antenna orientation (as well  as incidence), the return from each direction needed its own LO offset. The antennas’  peak gain was 34 dB, directed toward maximum range. 
NSCAT’s mass was 280 kg;  required input power was 275 W. The RF system was built around redundant TWTAs,  transmitting modulated 5-ms pulses at a PRF of 62 Hz, peak power 110 W. SeaWinds  marks a significant departure from the “stick antennas” of prior wind  scatterometers, relying instead on a dish antenna137 rotating at 18 RPM to sweep its two  beams over a nadir-centered swath 1,800 km wide (Figure 18.19). 
The first SeaWinds  mission was aboard QuikSCAT, mobilized by NASA and launched in June 1999 as a  rapid response to the premature loss of ADEOS in June 1997. The second SeaWinds  was embarked on Japan’s ADEOS-II. Both instruments operate at Ku band (13.4 kHz),  radiating 110 W, 1.5 ms pulses at 190 Hz PRF, split equally between the two antenna  beams. 
The transmitter is a TWTA, based on NSCAT heritage. The modulated pulse  bandwidth is 40 kHz, which is maintained within an 80 kHz filter in the receiver.   The received data must be compensated to offset the doppler shift, which varies   ch18.indd   57 12/19/07   5:15:19 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Instrument mass is 191 kg;  required input power is 217 W. These numbers illustrate the principal advantages of  the architecture, providing greater coverage with less mass and power, in contrast to  the stick-antenna architecture.138 System sensitivity accommodates s  0 in the range   –37 dB to –2 dB. The antenna is a 1-m reflector (gain ∼40 dB), with two feeds, result - ing in a pair of pencil beams at 46 ° (H polarization) and 54 ° incidence (V polarization). 
 The illumination geometry also is advantageous because the incidence is the same for  all aspect angles. The beam-limited footprints are approximately 30 km by 40 km.  Following onboard processing, the average data rate is 40 kbits/s. 
SeaWinds perfor - mance139 is at least comparable to other wind scats, wind speed and direction accuracy  being 3 m/s to 20 m/s at 2 m/s and 20 °, respectively. Nominal surface resolution is   50 km; advanced processing140 reduces this to ∼25 km. Although the swath is 1800 km  wide, the variety of aspect and polarization coverage limits the science-compliant wind  vector retrievals to strips from 250 km to 800 km either side of the ground track. 
Aquarius.  The Aquarius  mission is designed to map sea surface salinity, for  which L band radiometric sensing of the ocean’s emissivity is the primary measure - ment. However, emissivity is a function of the roughness of the surface,141 as well as  its temperature and dielectric constant, which is the variable of interest. 
The Aquarius  payload includes an L band (1260 MHz) scatterometer to measure surface roughness.  The scatterometer and radiometer share the same 2.5-m diameter reflector illuminated  by three offset feeds, which generate three side-looking beams (at 29 °, 38°, and 45 °,  incidence), thus sweeping out strips of coverage as the spacecraft moves along its  orbit. The scatterometer is fully polarized (HH, HV , VH, and VV). 
Peak transmitted  power is ∼250 W, pulse length is 1 ms, sufficient to support sea surface s  0 over the  range 0 dB to –40 dB. Resolution is modest, at ∼150 km. The scatterometer and radi - ometer share electronics. 
Combined instrument mass is ∼400 kg, and required prime  power is ∼450 W.FIGURE 18.19  The Seawinds scatterometer,  as embarked on Japan’s ADEOS-II spacecraft.  The radar drives the conically scanned reflector  antenna, which takes up most of the real estate on  the Earth-viewing face of the satellite. ch18.indd   58 12/19/07   5:15:20 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.596x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 18.6 RADAR SOUNDERS In its most general form, a radar sounder is a device whose transmissions are designed  to penetrate the volume of a target medium, from which the waveform of the resulting  backscatter indicates variations in dielectric contrasts as a function of depth.† As a  sounder passes over an illuminated region, the sequence of ranging waveforms gener - ates a profile, which is a two-dimensional reflectivity cross section of the surveyed  volume. 
Penetration depth in general increases with wavelength and also with radiated  power. On the other hand, reflectivity depends on the dielectric contrasts between  internal layers; a material’s dielectric constant is also a function of wavelength. It  follows that space-based radar sounders must choose a frequency and bandwidth that  balance the often conflicting requirements of penetration, reflectivity, and resolution,  under the constraints of available power and antenna aperture. 
The space-based radar sounders highlighted in Table 18.9 fall naturally into two  groups: subsurface and atmospheric/ionospheric. It is evident that the subsurface  sounders all are at relatively low frequency, in contrast to the atmospheric sounders at  much higher frequency. The ionospheric sounding mode of MARSIS is a special case,  elaborated below. 
Subsurface Sounding –flight Systems.  Subsurface sounding from a space- based radar is considerably more challenging than from a surface-mounted GPR  (Chapter 21) or a very low altitude aircraft. Of course, once radar signals penetrate  the surface, the usual volumetric attenuations and reflections occur. 
As with any GPR,  large dynamic range is required, since the signals of interest may be weaker than  competing returns by 50 dB or more. Radar sounding to appreciable depth is possible  only in dry materials such as lunar regolith or in very cold low-loss ice.

18.60  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 In addition to the usual GPR considerations, two space-specific issues arise, neither  of which can be solved by the usual expedient of increasing the radar’s transmitted  power. The first problem is clutter. From orbital altitude, scatterers on the surface far  from nadir may generate strong backscatter that appears at the same radar range as  the signals reflected from depth, as suggested in Figure 18.20. 
The problem is com - pounded with increasing altitude and by the fact that at the long wavelengths required  for deeper penetration, the size constraints on a spacecraft-mounted antenna dictate  that the illumination pattern will have little or no directivity. Processing over groups  of returns to reduce the effective width of the beam can be helpful. Doppler-based  techniques are applicable to the along-track direction.142 However, the orbit’s alti - tude-velocity parameter (Table 18.1) may be so large that the available ambiguity-free  range-doppler window is too small to be useful. 
Narrowing the effective antenna pat - tern in the cross-track direction presents even more of a challenge. The second problem is range sidelobes. From orbital altitudes and from a realistic  spacecraft, it is not feasible to transmit a simple short pulse that has sufficient energy  to generate useful reflections from depth. 
Long modulated pulses are the only practical  method. Unfortunately, the specular component of surface reflection usually is very  strong at the long wavelengths required for subsurface sounding. Pulse compression  of the surface return generates range sidelobes which appear at depths that could easily  overwhelm the weaker reflections from the internal structure. 
The standard strategy  to mitigate this problem is rigorous sidelobe control, requiring severe pulse amplitude  weighting and strict control of phase and amplitude linearity. Due to the large footprint of a space-based sounder, and the need to salvage all  possible contributions of signals from depth, it is standard practice to assume that the  dominant in situ returns arise from specular scattering, hence from extended horizontal  layers.143 The contributing area is determined by the radius rF of the first Fresnel zone,  r hF= λ/2 in free space, where h is the altitude of the radar above the surface. The  radius is somewhat larger within the medium, since the spherical wavefront is flat - tened due to the slower speed of in situ propagation. 
ALSE.  The Apollo Lunar Sounder Experiment144,145 was a combination imager  and sounder, operating at wavelengths of 60 m, 20 m, and 2 m. The ALSE sounder  FIGURE 18.20  Two problems that challenge space-based sub - surface sounding are (1) range-coincident competition between the  desired return from depth and surface clutter and (2) range sidelobes  from the very strong return from the top surface at nadir.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.616x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 mode was designed to measure subsurface horizons in the lunar dielectric constant  in both side-looking and down-looking viewing geometry. The instrument was based  on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) principles. The data were recorded directly onto  70-mm photographic film, which was processed through a combination of optical  and digital means following return of Apollo 17  to Earth. 
(Optical processing was the  state-of-the-art back in 1972 for SAR data.) Penetration depths proved to be approxi - mately proportional to wavelength. The radar’s waveform was constrained so that all  sidelobes were at least 45 dB below the main-beam peak for all responses beyond three  impulse widths of the compressed signal. Amplitude and phase linearity were con - strained to be better than 0.1% and 0.001 radian, respectively. 
The transmitted pulses  were linear FM, at 10% bandwidth in all three bands. Nominal free-space resolutions  were 300 m, 100 m, and 10 m. Antenna gains were −0.8 dB, −0.7 dB, and +7.3 dB. 
 These low numbers follow from the poor directivity of the antenna. Transmitted aver - age power was 12 W, 4 W, and 1.5 W. Penetration depths were predicted to be 1300 m,  800 m, and 160 m, which turned out to be consistent with ALSE’s performance. 
MARSIS.  The European Space Agency’s Mars Express  spacecraft includes the  Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding instrument,146 the  first orbital sounder to fly since ALSE. MARSIS is a multifrequency down-looking  radar that radiates 1-MHz pulses in one of four bands centered on the frequencies cited  in Table 18.9. 
Mars Express  is in an elliptical orbit; subsurface sounding operations  are restricted to the lower 250 km to 800 km altitudes. Sounding is further limited  by the ionosphere, which prevents effective radio wave propagation to the surface at  frequencies below the plasma frequency f0, which at Mars is ∼4 MHz on the sunlit side  and ∼1 MHz on the dark side. The ionosphere induces a frequency-dependent time  delay on the signal according to the index of refraction n, where n f f = −[ ( / )]/102 1 2. 
  The resulting dispersion distorts the radar modulation, which must be compensated  before pulse compression. The 40-m dipole antenna oriented orthogonal to the orbit  plane is only weakly directive, with a 2.1 dB gain. The two 20-m long elements were  not unfurled until two years into the mission, due to concerns about their potential  for damaging the spacecraft during deployment. 
The effective cross-track footprint  is on the order of 25 km. The along-track footprint is about 5 km, which is the result  of onboard coherent doppler processing. This strategy reduces the impact of off-nadir  clutter arising from sources in the along-track direction. 
The technique improves the  subclutter visibility by 10 dB or more. The radar’s mass and input power are 17 kg and  64 W. Peak radiated power is 10 W. 
The system noise floor is about 50 dB below the  mean surface return, which establishes the dynamic range that limits depth of penetra - tion. MARSIS has performed as intended,147 with early results from the polar layered  deposits, for example. SHARAD . 
The Shallow Radar sounder148 was designed to complement MARSIS.  In general terms, it has higher resolution at a higher frequency, designed to provide  sharper differentiation of the upper several hundred meters of the surface of Mars.  SHARAD transmits a 10-MHz linear FM signal centered at 20 MHz. 
Theoretical verti - cal resolution is 7.5 m in material having a permittivity of 4. The 10-m dipole antenna  has a frequency-dependent two-way gain of −5.7 dB to +0.2 dB. The effective beam  footprint (after doppler processing) is ∼0.5 km along track and ∼5 km across track. 
 Nominal SNR with respect to the surface return is in excess of 50 dB. Instrument mass  is ∼17 kg, input power is ∼45 W. SHARAD measurements started late 2006 only when  the MRO orbit was circularized after six months of aerobraking.

18.62  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 SELENE.  The Japanese lunar mission, SELENE,149 includes a 5 MHz Lunar  Radar Sounder (LRS)150 as one of its 14 payload instruments. The orbit is circular  at 100-km altitude. 
The radar transmits 200 µsec linear FM signals that are demodu - lated using the stretch technique, similar to radar altimeters. Each pulse is amplitude- weighted by a sine function (0, p  ) to suppress sidelobes by ∼30 dB from the surface  return that otherwise would mask the desired returns from depth. The in situ resolution  is nominally ∼40 m within a medium of permittivity ∼4. 
The radar dynamic range is  ∼50 dB to permit observation of subsurface profiles to a depth of several km. The  antenna is comprised of two sets of dipoles, 30 m tip-to-tip, with an effective footprint  of several tens of km. Peak output power is 800 W. 
Instrument mass is 24 kg and input  power 50 W. Atmospheric & Ionospheric Sounding –Flight Systems.  The objective of this  class of radar sounders is to generate a cross-section (profile) of the water or elec - tron density in the orbit plane beneath the spacecraft. 
Atmospheric sounding by radar  requires sensitivity to relatively weak backscatter, effective suppression (or avoid - ance) of the strong return from nadir, modest range resolution, and relatively narrow  fields of view. These requirements lead to high power radars at Ku band or above, a  simple pulse waveform, and substantial antenna area. Radar sounders should not be confused with (passive) microwave radiometers— also called sounders, unfortunately—that are used by operational meteorological  satellites to estimate atmospheric water distribution. 
A multifrequency radiometer  generates coarse water vapor density profiles for which altitude is a function of fre - quency. Passive microwave sounding units have mass and power requirements on the  order of 50 kg and 75 W, much less than their active radar counterparts. TRMM. 
 The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission was a joint undertaking  between NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The five- instrument payload includes the Precipitation Radar151 (PR), which was designed and  built by JAXA (then NASDA), and was the first of its kind on a space-based platform.  Its precessing 400-km orbit, inclined at 35 °, supports temporally and spatially sparse  atmospheric coverage over tropical land and sea. 
The radar provides a three-dimen - sional structure of rainfall from the surface to an altitude of 20 km. When combined  with data from the passive microwave radiometer (TMI), PR data support improved  accuracy of rainfall retrievals. The radar’s Ku band ( ∼2 cm) frequency is about three  times higher than most surface-based meteorological radars, but was selected to  achieve a reasonably narrow 0.71 ° beamwidth from an antenna area constrained by  spacecraft accommodation to be no more than 2.1 m by 2.1 m. 
Horizontal resolution  at nadir is about 4.3 km. The antenna, a 128-element slotted waveguide phased array  with 47 dB gain, is electronically scanned over ±17° across track, covering a swath  220-km wide, centered at nadir. Peak transmitted power is 500 W, generated from  128 solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs), one for each waveguide. 
The 250-m range  resolution is set by the unity time-bandwidth-product 1.6 µsec pulse. The radar has  sufficient sensitivity to respond to rain rates as small as 0.7 mm/hr. Instrument mass is  465 kg; required input power is 250 W. 
The ionospheric sounding mode on MARSIS (described above) is aimed primar - ily at characterization of the Martian ionosphere152 during daylight conditions from  altitudes below 1200 km. The radar is operated as a stepped-frequency instrument,  sweeping 100 kHz to 5.4 MHz in 10.937 kHz intervals, over 7.38 seconds. From  500 km, the nominal SNR is 5.4 dB, increasing to 21.3 dB at 3.0 MHz.

 SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING RADARS  18.636x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 18 CloudSat.  Launched in April 2006, CloudSat includes as its primary payload  the Cloud Profiling Radar153 (CPR). CloudSat154 flies in a sun-synchronous orbit in  close formation with CALIPSO, which carries a cloud-profiling lidar, and in some - what looser formation with Aqua, Aura, Terra, and PARASOL. 
Taken together, these  six environmental satellites constitute the so-called A-Train. The average separation  between CloudSat and CALIPSO is about 460 km, which corresponds to a one-minute  delay between the radar and lidar cloud profiling measurements. The CPR was devel - oped jointly by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency. 
It is a 94 GHz nadir-viewing  real aperture radar, transmitting 3.3 µsec pulses at a PRF of 4.3 kHz to fill a window  from the surface to 25 km altitude with 500-m vertical resolution sounding data. The  antenna diameter, limited by the launch vehicle shroud, is 1.95 m, which supports  across-track and along-track resolutions of 1.4 km and 2.5 km, respectively. The larger  along-track resolution reflects the 0.3-sec integration time of the returns. 
Antenna gain  is 63 dB. Average data rate is 15 kbits/s. Dynamic range is 70 dB; minimum detectable  volumetric return is –26 dBZ. 
The PR mass is 230 kg; input power required is 270 W.  Peak power transmitted is 1.7 kW. The CPR’s high-power amplifier (HPA) is the first of its kind for a space-based  radar, an extended interaction klystron.155 The klystron is driven by 200 mW signals  from a solid-state preamplifier. 
The klystron requires 20 kV , provided by a high-voltage  power supply system that also is a space first. The HPA is fully redundant. DPR . 
The dual-frequency precipitation radar is the active microwave instru - ment156 for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory. DPR is  based on a Ku band instrument (KuPR) similar to its predecessor on TRMM, augmented  by a Ka band (35.55 GHz) radar (KaPR). Their two phased array slotted waveguide  antennas are sized and oriented so that their footprints are the same. 
Their respective  steered beams are synchronized so that for the central 100-km swath within which they  both have coverage, their vertical profiles are near-simultaneous. The KuPR and KaPR  antennas are sized at 2.4 m × 2.4 m and 1.4 m × 1.0 m, respectively, each comprised  of 148 slotted waveguides driven by individual solid-state power amplifiers. Peak  transmitted powers are 700 W and 140 W. 
Mass and input power of the two radars are  450 kg and 330 kg and 384 W and 326 W. The only other instrument in the payload  is a microwave radiometer. To provide coverage at more latitudes, the spacecraft has  a higher inclination orbit than TRMM’s 39 °. 
The main advantages of the second fre - quency and increased power are to distinguish between rain and snow and to increase  sensitivity to rain rates as low as 0.2 mm/hr. REFERENCES  1. D.
