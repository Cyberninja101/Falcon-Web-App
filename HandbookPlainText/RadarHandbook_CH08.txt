8.1 INTRODUCTIO N*
A pulse compression radar transmits a long pulse with pulsewidth T and peak power 
Pt, which is coded using frequency or phase modulation to achieve a bandwidth  
B that is large compared to that of an uncoded pulse with the same duration.1 The 
transmit pulsewidth is chosen to achieve the single-pulse transmit energy, given 
by Et1 = PtT, that is required for target detection or tracking. The received echo 
is processed using a pulse compression filter to yield a narrow compressed pulse 
response with a mainlobe width of approximately 1/B that does not depend on the 
duration of the transmitted pulse. 
Figure 8.1 shows a block diagram of a basic pulse compression radar. The coded 
pulse is generated at a low power level in the waveform generator and amplified to the 
required peak transmit power using a power amplifier transmitter. The received signal 
is mixed to an intermediate frequency (IF) and amplified by the IF amplifier. The sig -
nal is then processed using a pulse compression filter that consists of a matched filter 
to achieve maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As discussed below, the matched 
filter is followed by a weighting filter if required for reduction of time sidelobes. The 
output of the pulse compression filter is applied to an envelope detector, amplified by 
the video amplifier, and displayed to an operator.
The ratio of the transmit pulsewidth to the compressed pulse mainlobe width is 
defined as the pulse compression ratio. The pulse compression ratio is approximately 
T/(1/B) or TB, where TB is defined as the time-bandwidth product of the waveform. 
Typically, the pulse compression ratio and time-bandwidth product are large compared 
to unity. 
The use of pulse compression provides several performance advantages. The 
increased detection range capability of a long-pulse radar system is achieved with 
pulse compression while retaining the range resolution capability of a radar that 
uses a narrow uncoded pulse. The required transmitted energy can be established by Chapter 8

increasing the waveform pulsewidth without exceeding constraints on transmitter peak 
power. The average power of the radar may be increased without increasing the pulse 
repetition frequency (PRF) and, hence, decreasing the radar’s unambiguous range. In 
addition, the radar is less vulnerable to interfering signals that differ from the coded 
transmitted signal.
The mainlobe of the compressed pulse at the output of the matched filter has time, 
or range, sidelobes that occur within time intervals of duration T, before and after the 
peak of the peak of the compressed pulse. The time sidelobes can conceal targets, 
which would otherwise be resolved using a narrow uncoded pulse. In some cases, such 
as phase-coded waveforms or nonlinear frequency modulation waveforms, matched 
filter processing alone achieves acceptable time sidelobe levels. However, for the case 
of a linear frequency modulation waveform, the matched filter is generally followed 
by a weighting filter to provide a reduction in time sidelobe levels. In this case, the 
weighting filter results in a signal-to-noise ratio loss compared to that of matched filter 
processing alone. 
8.2 PULSE COMPRESSION WAVEFORM TYPES
The following sections describe the characteristics of the linear and nonlinear fre -
quency modulation waveforms, phase-coded waveforms, and time-frequency coded 
waveforms. The application of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices for linear fre -
quency modulation (LFM) waveform pulse compression is discussed. Waveform 
signal analysis techniques, matched filter properties, and the waveform autocor -
relation and ambiguity function definitions used are summarized in the Appendix 
at the end of this chapter.FIGURE   8. 1 Block diagram of a basic pulse compression radarWeveform

Linear Frequency Modulation.1,2 The linear frequency modulation, or chirp, 
waveform has a rectangular amplitude modulation with pulsewidth T and a linear 
frequency modulation with a swept bandwidth B applied over the pulse. The time-
bandwidth product of the LFM waveform is equal to TB, where TB is the product of 
pulsewidth and swept bandwidth. The 3-dB width of the compressed pulse at the out -
put of the matched filter is t 3 = 0.886/ B, for large values of time-bandwidth product. 
The peak time sidelobe level of the compressed pulse is –13.2 dB. 
As discussed in Section 8.1, a frequency-domain weighting filter is generally 
required following the matched filter to provide reduced time sidelobe levels, at the 
cost of reduced SNR and an increase in the width of the compressed pulse. As an 
example, the use of 40-dB Taylor weighting reduces the peak time sidelobe level from 
–13.2 dB to –40 dB and introduces a 1.15 dB loss in SNR. The 3-dB width of the com -
pressed pulse with weighting increases from t 3 = 0.886/ B to t 3 = 1.25/ B.
The LFM waveform has a knife-edge ambiguity function with contours that are 
approximately elliptical with a major axis defined by the line v = at, where a  = ± B/T 
is the LFM slope. This property introduces range-doppler coupling at the matched filter 
output causing the matched filter output peak to occur earlier in time for a target with a 
positive doppler frequency compared to a stationary target at the same range, assuming 
a positive linear frequency modulation slope and later in time for a negative slope. 
The compressed pulse shape and SNR are tolerant to doppler shift for the LFM 
waveform. As a result, it is not necessary to implement multiple matched filters to 
cover the range of expected target doppler shifts.
LFM Waveform Definition.  The LFM waveform is a single-pulse bandpass signal 
defined as
 x(t) = A rect ( t/T) cos [2p  f0 t + pa t2] (8.1)
where T is the pulsewidth,  f0 is the carrier frequency, a  is the LFM slope, and the rect 
function is defined as
 rect( )xx

The LFM slope is given by a = ± B/T, where the plus sign applies for a positive 
LFM slope (termed an up-chirp ) and the minus sign for a negative LFM slope (a down-
chirp ). The amplitude modulation is a(t) = A rect ( t/T ) and the phase modulation is a 
quadratic function of time:
 f (t) = pa t2 (8.3)
The frequency modulation, defined as the instantaneous frequency deviation from 
the carrier frequency f0, is expressed in terms of the phase modulation by

where the plus sign applies for a positive LFM slope and the minus sign for a negative 
slope. The complex envelope of the LFM waveform is expressed in terms of the 
amplitude and phase modulation functions as
 u(t) = A rect( t/T )ejp a t2 
Figure 8.2 shows an example of an LFM bandpass signal with a pulsewidth T = 10 µs, 
swept bandwidth B = 1 MHz and time-bandwidth product equal to TB = 10. The LFM 
slope is B/T = 0.1 MHz/µs. The instantaneous frequency of the LFM waveform varies 
between 1.5 and 2.5 MHz over the pulse duration, as indicated by the reduction in the 
spacing of successive positive-going zero crossings of the signal.†
LFM Waveform Spectrum.1,2,3 The spectrum of the LFM waveform has a signifi -
cant amplitude variation versus frequency for small time-bandwidth products. For large 
values of time-bandwidth product, the magnitude of the spectrum approaches rect(  f/B)

The LFM spectrum is expressed in terms of the complex Fresnel integral, and the 
amplitude variation present for low values of TB is termed the Fresnel ripple . 
LFM Waveform Ambiguity Function . The waveform autocorrelation function and 
ambiguity function for an LFM waveform are given by

where the sinc function is defined as
 sinc( x) = sin(px)/(px) 
The matched filter time response for a target with doppler shift  fd is obtained by the 
substitution τ = –t in the autocorrelation function:

LFM Range-doppler Coupling.  The LFM waveform exhibits range-doppler cou -
pling which causes the peak of the compressed pulse to shift in time by an amount 
proportional to the doppler frequency. The peak occurs earlier in time at t = –fdT/B for 
a positive LFM slope, compared to peak response for a stationary target. The peak of 
the ambiguity function is shifted to t  = fdT/B for a positive LFM slope.
Time Delay and Range Resolution Widths.  The time-delay resolution width is equal 
to the width of the ambiguity function at a specified level relative to the peak value.  
†  Low values of carrier frequency and time-bandwidth product have been used to illustrate the variation of instanta -
neous frequency over the pulse in Figure 8.2.

The x-dB time delay resolution is measured between the values of τ for which 
 20log | sinc( Bt) |  =  −x (dB) 
The range resolution is equal to c/2 times the corresponding time delay resolution 
where c is the speed of light. Table 8.1 contains a summary of the resolution widths 
for the LFM waveform.
LFM Waveform Examples.  Figure 8.3 shows the magnitude of the autocorrela -
tion function as a function of relative time delay τ for doppler shifts‡ of –0.5 MHz, 
0 and 0.5 MHz, pulsewidth T = 10 µs, swept bandwidth B = 1 MHz, and LFM slope 
a = B/T = 0.1 MHz/µs. A doppler shift of fd = B/2 = 0.5 MHz causes the peak of the 
correlation function to move to t  = fdT/B = 5 µs. Figure 8.4 shows the result when 
the pulsewidth is increased to 100 µs to yield a waveform with an LFM slope equal

Frequency Domain Weighting for LFM Time Sidelobe Reduction.1,2,4 A frequency 
domain weighting filter is used following the matched filter for time sidelobe reduction. 
Taylor weighting provides a realizable approximation to the ideal Dolph-Chebyshev 
weighting, which achieves the minimum mainlobe width for a given value of peak 
time sidelobe level. The frequency response of the equivalent low pass filter for the 
Taylor weighing filter is

 F4 = −0.00161019
 F5 = 0.000347037
Table 8.2 shows the peak time sidelobe level, 3-dB and 6-dB compressed-pulse 
widths, and filter matching loss for the three weighting function types. The application 
of –40-dB Taylor weighting reduces the peak time sidelobe level from –13.2 dB to  
–40 dB and increases the filter matching loss from 0 dB to 1.15 dB. The 3-dB com -
pressed-pulse mainlobe width increases from 0.886/ B to 1.25/ B when –40-dB Taylor 
weighting is used. The 3-dB and 6-dB mainlobe widths and filter matching loss for 
Hamming weighting are approximately the same as for –40-dB Taylor weighting.
These results assume that the time-bandwidth product of the LFM waveform is 
much greater than unity so that the time sidelobe performance is not limited by the 
Fresnel amplitude ripple in the spectrum of the LFM waveform. Cook and Paolillo3 
and Cook and Bernfeld2 have analyzed the effect of the Fresnel amplitude ripple and 
pulse rise-time and fall-time on time sidelobe levels. A phase predistortion technique 
is described by Cook and Paolillo,3 which reduces the Fresnel amplitude ripple to 
allow low time sidelobes to be achieved for LFM waveforms with relatively small 
time-bandwidth products. 
Radar equipment distortion sources also establish limitations on achievable time 
sidelobe levels and are discussed by Klauder et al.1 and Cook and Bernfeld.2 The 
method of paired-echo analysis is used to evaluate the effect of amplitude and phase 
distortion on the time sidelobe levels. Frequency domain amplitude and phase dis -
tortion is typically caused by filters and transmission line reflections. Time domain 
amplitude and phase distortion, termed modulation distortion  by Cook and Bernfeld, 
can result from power supply ripple in high-power transmitter amplifiers.2

SAW Devices for LFM Pulse Compression.  A Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) 
device consists of an input transducer and an output transducer mounted on a piezo -
electric substrate. These transducers are usually implemented as interdigital devices 
that consist of a metal film deposited on the surface of the acoustic medium. This metal 
film is made of fingers (see Figure 8.7) that dictate the frequency characteristic of the 
unit. The input transducer converts an electrical signal into a sound wave with over 
95% of the energy traveling along the surface of the medium. The output transducer 
taps a portion of this surface sound wave and converts it back into an electric signal.
The SAW device6-8 has unique features that dictate its usefulness for a given radar 
application. It represents one of the few analog processing devices used in modern 
radar. The advantages of the SAW device are its compact size, the wide bandwidths 
that can be attained, the ability to tailor the transducers to a particular waveform, the 
all-range coverage of the device, and the low cost of reproducing a given design. The 
major shortcomings of the SAW approach are that the waveform length is restricted. 
Since sound travels about 3 to 15 mm/µs on the surface of a SAW device, a 250 mm 
quartz device (about the largest available), has a usable delay of about 70 µs for a 
single pass.9 Also, because each SAW device is waveform specific, each waveform 
requires a different design.
SAW pulse compression devices depend on the interdigital transducer finger loca -
tions or the surface-etched grating to determine its bandpass characteristics. Figure 8.7 
shows three types of filter determination approaches. A wideband input transducer and 
a frequency-selective (dispersive) output transducer are used in Figure 8.7 a. When an 
impulse is applied to the input, the output signal is initially a low frequency that increases 
(based on the output transducer finger spacings) at later portions of the pulse. This results

in an up-chirp waveform that would be a matched filter for a down-chirp transmitted 
waveform. In Figure 8.7 b both the input transducer and the output transducer are dis -
persive, which would result in the same impulse response as that shown in Figure 8.7 a. 
For a given crystal length and material, the waveform duration for the approaches in 
Figure 8.7 a and Figure 8.7 b would be the same and is limited to the time that it takes 
an acoustic wave to traverse the crystal length. Figure 8.7 c shows a reflection-array-
compression (RAC) approach10 that essentially doubles the achievable pulse length for 
the same crystal length. In an RAC, the input and output transducers have a broad band -
width. A frequency-sensitive grating is etched on the crystal surface to reflect a portion 
of the surface-wave signal to the output transducer. This grating coupling does not have a 
significant impact on the surface-wave energy. Except for a 2:1 increase in the waveform 
duration, the impulse response of the RAC is the same as for the approaches shown in 
Figure 8.7 a and b. Thus, these three approaches yield a similar impulse response.
Figure 8.8 shows a sketch of a SAW pulse compression device with dispersive 
input and output transducers. As the energy in a SAW device is concentrated in its sur -
face wave, the SAW approach is much more efficient than bulk-wave devices, where 
the wave travels through the crystal. The propagation velocity of the surface wave is 
in the range of 1500 to 4000 m/s, depending on the crystal material, and allows a large 
delay in a compact device. Acoustic absorber material is required at the crystal edges 
to reduce the reflections and, hence, the spurious responses. The upper frequency 
limit depends on the accuracy that can be achieved in the fabrication of the interdigital 
transducer. The SAW device must provide a response that is centered on a carrier, 
as the lowest frequency of operation is about 20 MHz and is limited by the crystal. 
A matched-filter SAW pulse compression device can use variable finger lengths to 
achieve frequency weighting, and this internal weighting can correct for the Fresnel 
amplitude ripples11 in the FM spectrum. With this correction, –43 dB time sidelobe 
levels can be achieved for a linear-FM waveform with TB as low as 15. The level of 
sidelobe suppression depends upon the time bandwidth product, the weighting func -
tion applied, and fabrication errors in the SAW device. Time sidelobe levels of –35 dB 
have been achieved for TB between 5 and 15. TB products of up to 2000 have been 
achieved12 with time sidelobes better than –40 dB.13 Dynamic range is limited by non -
linearities in the crystal material, but dynamic ranges over 90 dB have been achieved. 
The most common SAW materials are quartz, lithium niobate, and lithium tantalite .

Nonlinear Frequency Modulation Waveforms.  The nonlinear-FM wave -
form has several distinct advantages over LFM.14,16 It requires no frequency domain 
weighting for time sidelobe reduction because the FM modulation of the waveform is 
designed to provide the desired spectrum shape that yields the required time sidelobe 
level. This shaping is accomplished by increasing the rate of change of frequency 
modulation near the ends of the pulse and decreasing it near the center. This serves 
to taper the waveform spectrum so that the matched filter response has reduced time 
sidelobes.16 Thus, the loss in signal-to-noise ratio associated with frequency domain 
weighting (as for the LFM waveform) is eliminated.
If a symmetrical FM modulation is used (Figure 8.9 a) with time-domain amplitude 
weighting to reduce the frequency sidelobes, the nonlinear-FM waveform will have a 
thumbtack-like ambiguity function (Figure 8.10). A symmetrical waveform typically 
has a frequency that increases (or decreases) with time during the first half of the 
pulse and decreases (or increases) during the last half of the pulse. A nonsymmetrical 
waveform is obtained by using one-half of a symmetrical waveform (Figure 8.9 b). 
However, the nonsymmetrical waveform retains some of the range-doppler coupling 
of the linear-FM waveform.
One of the primary disadvantages of the nonlinear-FM waveform is that it is less 
doppler tolerant than the LFM. In the presence of doppler shift, the time sidelobes 
of the pulse-compressed NLFM tend to increase compared to those of the LFM. 
Figure 8.14, shown later in this section, and Table 8.3 illustrate this behavior for a typical 
NLFM pulse.
This characteristic of the NLFM waveform sometimes necessitates processing using 
multiple matched filters offset in doppler shift to achieve the required time sidelobe 
level. Because of the doppler sensitivity of the ambiguity function, the nonlinear fre -
quency modulation waveform is useful in a tracking system where range and doppler 
frequency are approximately known, and the target doppler shift can be compensated in 
the matched filter. The nonsymmetrical NLFM waveform is used in the MMR system, 
for example, which detects and tracks ordnance such as mortars, artillery, and rockets.
To achieve a –40-dB Taylor compressed pulse response, for example, the fre -
quency-versus-time (frequency modulation) function of a nonsymmetrical NLFM 
waveform of bandwidth B is14

The frequency modulation-versus-time function for a tangent-based waveform is 
given as
 f t B t T T t T ( ) tan( )/( tan) = − ≤ ≤ 2 2 2 2 β β for  (8.16)
where T is the pulsewidth, B is the swept bandwidth, and b  is defined as 
 β α α = ≤ < ∞−tan ( ),10  
where a  is a time sidelobe level control factor.
When a  is zero, the tangent-based NLFM waveform reduces to an LFM wave -
form. However, a  cannot be made arbitrarily large because the compressed pulse 
tends to distort. Collins and Atkins15 discuss an extension of the tangent-based NLFM 
for which the frequency modulation function is a weighted sum of tangent-based and 
linear frequency modulation terms. 
Figure 8.12 shows the frequency modulation-versus-time functions for a sine-
based NLFM waveform with k = 0.6, a tangent-based NLFM waveform with a  = 2.5, 
and an LFM waveform.
The sensitivity of a NLFM waveform to doppler shift can be seen in Figure 8.13, 
which shows the matched filter output for a sine-based NLFM waveform in the pres -
ence of doppler shift.
The ambiguity function of a NLFM sine-based waveform is shown in Figure 8.14. 
It can be noted that this ambiguity function is more thumbtack-like in nature than for 
an LFM waveform, indicating that this waveform is more doppler sensitive than the 
LFM waveform.
Table 8.3 provides a comparison of NLFM waveforms with weighted and 
unweighted LFM for different values of the target radial velocity in terms of peak 
and average time sidelobe levels and SNR loss. The NLFM waveform shows better FIGURE   8. 11 Peak time sidelobe level for a sine-based NLFM waveform as

Phase-Coded Waveforms.  In phase-coded waveforms, the pulse is subdivided 
into a number of subpulses each of duration d  = T/N where T is the pulsewidth and N 
is the number of subpulses. Phase-coded waveforms are characterized by the phase 
modulation applied to each subpulse. 
Binary Phase Codes.  A phase-coded waveform that employs two phases is 
called binary , or biphase , coding. A binary phase-coded waveform is constant 
in magnitude with two phase values, 0 ° or 180 °. The binary code consists of a 
sequence of either 0s and 1s or +1s and −1s. The phase of the signal alternates FIGURE   8. 14 Ambiguity function of a sine-based symmetrical NLFM waveform

between 0 ° and 180 ° in accordance 
with the sequence of elements, 0s and 
1s or +1s and −1s, in the phase code, 
as shown in Figure 8.15. Because the 
frequency is not usually a multiple of 
the reciprocal of the subpulse width, 
the coded signal is generally discon -
tinuous at the phase-reversal points 
This does not impact its time side-
lobes, but does cause some increase 
in the spectrum sidelobe levels.17
Upon reception, the compressed pulse is obtained by matched-filter processing. 
The width of the compressed pulse at the half-amplitude point is nominally equal to 
the subpulse width. The range resolution is hence proportional to the time duration of 
one element of the code (one subpulse). The time-bandwidth product and pulse com -
pression ratio are equal to the number of subpulses in the waveform; i.e., the number 
of elements in the code.
Optimal Binary Codes.  Optimal binary codes are binary sequences whose peak 
sidelobe of the aperiodic autocorrelation function is the minimum possible for a given 
code length. Codes whose autocorrelation function, or zero-doppler response, exhibit 
low sidelobes are desirable for pulse compression radars. Responses due to moving 
targets will differ from the zero-doppler response. If the matched filter is based only 
on the zero-doppler response, an increase in the time sidelobes will result. Ultimately, 
if the doppler shift becomes very large, the matched filter response will degrade. This 
can be alleviated by utilizing a bank of matched filters, covering the expected range of 
doppler shifts. Because this is more computationally intensive than a single matched 
filter, older radar systems tend not to employ banks of filters. The increase in compu -
tational capacity of modern radar systems, however, can make this more attractive. 
Barker Codes.  A special class of binary codes is the Barker18 codes. Barker codes 
are binary codes with peak time sidelobe levels equal to –20log( N), where N is the 
length of the code. The energy in the sidelobe region is minimum and uniformly dis -
tributed.19 The Barker code is the only uniform phase code that reaches this level.20 
All the known binary Barker codes are listed in Table 8.4. Only binary Barker codes 
of lengths 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, and 13 have been found.21–24
A pulse compression radar using Barker codes would be limited to a maximum 
time-bandwidth product of 13.26 Figure 8.16 shows the autocorrelation function of FIGURE   8. 15 Binary phase-coded signal

a length 13 Barker code for zero doppler shift superimposed upon all possible auto -
correlation functions of 13-bit binary sequences. It can be seen that the Barker code 
provides the lowest time sidelobe levels of all possible codes.  
Allomorphic Forms.  A binary code may be represented in any one of four allo -
morphic forms, all of which have the same correlation characteristics. These forms are 
the code itself, the inverted code (the code written in reverse order), the complemented 
code (1s changed to 0s and 0s to 1s), and the inverted complemented code. For sym -
metrical codes, the code and its inverse are identical.
Maximal-Length Sequences.  Maximal-length sequences have a structure simi -
lar to random sequences and, therefore, possess desirable autocorrelation functions. 
They are often called pseudorandom noise  (PRN)  sequences. Historically, these 
sequences were generated using n stages of shift registers with selected output taps 
used for feedback (see Figure 8.17). When the feedback connections are properly 
chosen, the output is a sequence of maximal length, which is the maximum length 
of a sequence of 1s and 0s that can be formed before the sequence is repeated. The 
length of the maximal sequence is N = 2n − 1, where n is the number of stages in the 
shift-register generator. 
The feedback connections that provide the maximal-length sequences may be 
determined from a study of primitive and irreducible polynomials. An extensive list of 
these polynomials is given by Peterson and Weldon.27 
Although maximal-length sequences have some desirable autocorrelation char -
acteristics, a maximum length sequence does not guarantee lowest time sidelobes 
when compared to other binary codes. An example of this is provided for a 15-bit 
sequence. Figure 8.18 a is a histogram of the peak time sidelobe level for the auto -
correlation of every possible combination of a 15-bit code. Figure 8.18 b is the same 
but for only maximal length sequences of 
length 15 code (a subset of Figure 8.18 a). 
Figure 8.18 a shows a lowest time sidelobe 
level of –17.5 dB. The lowest sidelobe for 
the maximal length sequence is seen from 
Figure 8.18 b to be only –14 dB.FIGURE   8. 16 Superposition of the autocorrelation functions for all

Minimum Peak Sidelobe Codes.  Binary codes that provide minimum peak time side-
lobe levels but exceed the time sidelobe levels achieved by Barker codes (–20 log ( N)) are 
termed minimum peak sidelobe codes.29 These codes are usually found using computer 
search techniques. Skolnik28 and Levanon and Mozeson29 provide these codes for various 
sequence lengths, along with the resulting time sidelobe levels.
Complementary Sequences.  Complementary sequences consist of two sequences 
of the same length N whose aperiodic autocorrelation functions have sidelobes equal 
in magnitude but opposite in sign. The sum of the two autocorrelation functions has 
a peak of 2 N and a sidelobe level of 0. In a practical application, the two sequences 
must be separated in time, frequency, or polarization, which results in decorrelation of 
radar returns so that complete sidelobe cancellation may not occur. Hence, they have 
not been widely used in pulse compression radars.
Polyphase Codes.  Waveforms consisting of more than two phases may also be 
used. Polyphase codes can be considered as complex sequences whose elements have 
a magnitude of one, but with variable phase.30 The phases of the subpulses alternate 
among multiple values rather than just the 0 ° and 180 ° of binary phase codes. These 
codes tend to be discrete approximations to LFM waveforms, and hence possess simi -
lar ambiguity functions and doppler shift characteristics. The autocorrelation functions 
are similar, with a peak to sidelobe ratio of about N.
Frank Codes.  The Frank code corresponds to a stepped-phase approximation of 
an LFM waveform.31 Here, the pulse is broken up into M groups, each of which is 
further broken up into M subpulses. Hence, the total length of the Frank code, is M2, 
with a corresponding compression ratio of M2. The Frank polyphase codes32 derive the 
sequence of phases for the subpulses by using a matrix technique as follows:

Concatenating the rows of this matrix yields the phase for each of the 16 subpulses. 
Figure 8.19 shows the phase modulation characteristic of the Frank Code for the above 
example. Note how the phase step between subpulses increases between subpulse 
groups with a length equal to four. This characteristic can be regarded as a stepped-
phase approximation to quadratic phase modulation.
As M increases, the peak-sidelobe–voltage ratio approaches ( p M)−1. This cor -
responds to approximately a 10-dB improvement over pseudorandom sequences 
of similar length. The ambiguity function grossly resembles the knife-edge (ridge) 
characteristic associated with LFM waveforms, as contrasted with the thumbtack 
characteristic of pseudorandom sequences (Figure 8.20) However, for small ratios of 
doppler shift to waveform bandwidth, a good doppler response can be obtained for 
reasonable target velocities.

doppler tolerance of the LFM codes. The P1 and P2 codes are modified versions of 
the Frank code with the DC frequency term at the center of the pulse instead of at the 
beginning. They are more tolerant of receiver band-limiting prior to pulse compression 
encountered in digital radar systems. The P1 codes contains M 2 elements as does the 
Frank code, but the relationship of the ith element to the jth group is expressed as35

The P3 and P4 codes are derived by essentially converting an LFM waveform to 
baseband.35 These tend to be more doppler tolerant than the Frank, P1, or P2 codes, 
and are also more tolerant of precompression bandwidth limitations that appear in 
radar systems. The phase of the P3 code is given as

For the case where n = 2, the weighting function can be integrated to obtain the following 
relationship between time and frequency31

which is similar to the sine-based NLFM discussed earlier. This particular code is 
called Phase from Nonlinear Frequency (PNL)31 and its autocorrelation function is 
shown in Figure 8.22 for a 100-µs pulsewidth, 1-MHz bandwidth waveform with  
a = 0.7 and fd = 0. The time sidelobe levels are seen to be below –32 dB. 
The ambiguity function is similar to that provided in the discussion of NLFM, 
which is expanded in Figure 8.23 to show in more detail the impact of doppler shift on 
the pulse compressed waveform for practical values of doppler shifts.FIGURE   8. 21 cosn on pedestal weighting function (shown for n = 2)k

As the doppler shift moves away from zero, the peak decreases and the close-in 
time sidelobe levels on one side or the other begin to increase. Note that an f/B ratio 
of 0.01 corresponds to a doppler shift associated with approximately a Mach 1 target 
at a S band carrier frequency.
In general for P(n, k) waveforms, the integral of the weighting function provides 
the relationship between time and frequency modulation as shown in Eq. 8.23:

B= + −

[ ( )cos( )] (8.23)
Since frequency modulation is proportional to the time derivative of phase, phase 
is obtained by integrating the frequency with respect to time. The expression for fre -
quency, however, is not straightforward, and is usually obtained through numerical 
evaluation.31 
Quadriphase Codes.  Quadriphase codes are an example of a phase-coded wave -
form without phase discontinuities. Quadriphase codes36,37 are based on the use of 
subpulses with a half-cosine shape and phase changes between adjacent subpulses 
of multiples of ±90°. The cosine weighting provides faster spectrum roll-off, lower 
filter matching loss, and smaller range sampling loss when compared to rectangular 
subpulse phase-coded waveforms (Table 8.6). FIGURE   8. 23 Expanded view of PNL ambiguity diagram for 100-µs pulse, a = 0.7, and

Generally, the frequencies are equally spaced, and the pulses are of the same ampli -
tude. The ambiguity function for a periodic waveform of this type consists of a central 
spike plus multiple spikes or ridges displaced in time and frequency. Although it is 
unachievable in practice, the objective is to create a high-resolution, thumbtack-like 
central spike with a clear area around it. Measurement is then performed on the high-
resolution central spike. The range resolution or compressed-pulse width is determined 
by the total bandwidth of all the pulses, and the doppler resolution is determined by the 
reciprocal of the waveform duration T. For example, a typical waveform in this class 
has N contiguous pulses of width τ whose spectra of width 1/ t  are placed side by side 
in frequency to eliminate gaps in the composite spectrum. Since the waveform band -
width is now N/t , the nominal compressed-pulse width is t /N. These relationships are 
summarized in Table 8.7. 
Shaping of the high-resolution central spike area as well as the gross structure of the 
ambiguity surface can be accomplished by variations of the basic waveform param -
eters, such as amplitude weighting of the pulse train, staggering of the pulse repetition 
interval, and frequency or phase coding of the individual pulses.39 
Costas Codes.  Costas codes are a class of frequency-coded waveforms that 
have near ideal range and doppler sidelobe behavior.40,41 In other words, their ambi -
guity function approaches the ideal thumbtack, providing both doppler and range 
information (Figure 8.25). All sidelobes, except for a few near the origin, have 
an amplitude of 1/ M. A few sidelobes close to the origin are about twice as large, 
or about 2/ M, which is characteristic of Costas codes. The compression ratio of a 
Costas code is about M.42
The Costas code is a burst of M contiguous uncoded pulse waveforms, each with a 
different frequency selected from a finite set of M equally spaced frequencies43 that are FIGURE   8. 24 Time-frequency-coded waveform

processed coherently. The order in which the frequencies are generated greatly influ -
ences the nature of the ambiguity function of the burst. If the frequencies are monotoni -
cally increasing or decreasing, the waveform is simply a stepped approximation to an 
LFM, which has a ridge in its ambiguity function (Figure 8.25). In order to approach a 
thumbtack-like ambiguity function, the order of the frequencies needs to be more ran -
dom in nature. The order of frequencies is the code, and it is generated via a special class 
of M × M Costas arrays. Costas41,44 suggested a technique for selecting the order of these 
frequencies to provide more controlled range and doppler sidelobes. An example of a 
Costas code of length 10 is shown in Figure 8.25, as it compares to the stepped LFM. 
Tables showing the sequence order for each waveform are also provided. 
8.3 FACTORS AFFECTING CHOICE OF  
PULSE COMPRESSION SYSTEMS
The choice of a pulse compression system involves the selection of the type of wave -
form and the method of generation and processing. Methods of generating and process -
ing pulse compression waveforms are discussed in the section on pulse compression 
implementation in this chapter. Discussions here will concentrate on the waveform 
itself. The primary factors influencing the selection of a particular waveform are usu -
ally the radar requirements of doppler tolerance and time sidelobe levels.
Table 8.8 summarizes these factors for three FM types: LFM, NLFM, and phase-coded 
waveforms. The systems are compared on the assumption that information is extracted by 
processing a single waveform as opposed to multiple-pulse processing. The symbols B 
and T denote the bandwidth and the pulsewidth of the waveform, respectively. 
In cases where an insufficient doppler shift occurs, such as with a stationary or 
tangential target, range resolution is the chief means for seeing a target in clutter.  FIGURE   8. 25 Comparison of ambiguity functions for N = 10 stepped linear and Costas sequence showing

8.4 PULSE COMPRESSION IMPLEMENTATION 
AND RADAR SYSTEM EXAMPLES
This section describes the generation and processing of pulse compression waveforms 
and provides examples of radar systems that utilize these processing techniques. Major 
advances are continually being made in the devices and techniques used in pulse com -
pression radars. Significant advances are evident in the digital and SAW techniques 
that allow the implementation of a variety of pulse compression waveform types. The 
digital approach has blossomed because of the manifold increase in computational 
speed and also because of the size reduction and the speed increase of the memory 
units. SAW technology has expanded because of the invention of the interdigital trans -
ducer,45 which provides efficient transformation of an electrical signal into acoustic 
energy and vice versa. 
Digital Waveform Generation.  Figure 8.26 shows a digital approach46 for gen -
erating the radar waveform. The phase control element supplies digital samples of the 
in-phase component I and the quadrature component Q, which are converted to their 
analog equivalents. These phase samples may define the baseband components of the 
desired waveform, or they may define the waveform components on a low-frequency 
carrier. If the waveform is on a carrier, the balanced modulator is not required, and the 
filtered components would be added directly. The sample-and-hold circuit removes 
the transients due to the nonzero transition time of the digital-to-analog (D/A) con -
verter. The low-pass filter smoothes (or interpolates) the analog signal components 
between waveform samples to provide the equivalent of a much higher waveform-
sampling rate. The I(t) component modulates a 0 ° carrier signal, and the Q(t) compo -
nent modulates a 90 ° phase-shifted carrier signal. The desired waveform is the sum of 
the 0 °-modulated carrier and the 90 °-modulated carrier. As mentioned earlier, when 
the digital phase samples include the carrier components, the I and Q components are 
centered on this carrier frequency and the low-pass filter can be replaced with a band -
pass filter centered on the IF carrier.
When a linear-FM waveform is desired, the phase samples follow a quadratic pat -
tern and can be generated by two cascaded digital integrators. The input digital com -
mand to the first integrator defines this quadratic phase function. The digital command 
to the second integrator is the output of the first integrator plus the desired carrier 
frequency. This carrier may be defined by the initial value of the first integrator. The 
desired initial phase of the waveform is the initial value of the second integrator or else 
may be added to the second-integrator output.
With advances in digital technology, it has become possible and practical to generate 
waveforms directly at IF or RF carrier frequencies on a single integrated circuit chip. This 
technique is called Direct Digital Synthesis , or DDS, and involves generating waveforms at 
FIGURE   8. 26 Digital waveform generation block diagram

high sampling rates and filtering the output. These devices generate the waveform by accu -
mulating phase information, which is then used to look up values of the waveform (usually 
a sine wave). This is converted to an analog signal with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC 
or D/A converter) and filtered. A variety of waveform types (e.g., LFM, NLFM, and CW 
waveforms) can be generated in this way by using the appropriate phase modulation char -
acteristic. As an example, the Analog Devices AD9858 Direct Digital Synthesizer47 uses a 
10-bit DAC operating at up to a 1-GHz internal clock speed (DAC update rate).
Digital Pulse Compression .48–50 Digital pulse compression techniques are 
routinely used for matched filtering of radar waveforms. The matched filter may be 
implemented by using a digital convolution for any waveform or else by use of stretch 
processing for a linear-FM waveform.
Digital pulse compression has distinct features that determine its acceptability 
for a particular radar application. Digital matched filtering usually requires multiple 
overlapped processing units for extended range coverage. The advantages of the digi -
tal approach are that long-duration waveforms present no problem, the results are 
extremely stable under a wide variety of operating conditions, and the same implemen -
tation could be used to handle multiple waveform types.
Analog product detectors used to extract I and Q baseband components have been 
replaced in many systems by digital down-conversion techniques. In this approach, the 
complex envelope sequence is evaluated by digital signal processing of A/D converter 
samples at the final IF output of the receiver, rather than by separate A/D conversion of 
baseband analog I and Q components.51–53 Digital down-conversion is advantageous 
because performance is not limited by amplitude and phase imbalances that exist in 
analog product-detection hardware.
Figure 8.27 illustrates two digital signal-processing approaches to providing the 
matched filter for a pulse compression waveform. In both cases, the input signal is the 
complex envelope sequence as formed using either digital down-conversion or analog

product detection followed by A/D conversion in each baseband channel. Figure 8.27 a 
shows a digital implementation of a time-domain convolution processor that will pro -
vide matched-filter performance for any radar waveform. In this case, discrete-time 
convolution is done in the time domain by convolution of the complex envelope input 
sequence following digital down-conversion with the matched filter impulse response 
sequence. Because time-domain convolution can be computationally intensive, a more 
economical approach from a computational standpoint is shown in Figure 8.27 b, in 
which frequency-domain processing is used to implement the convolution.
The frequency-domain digital pulse compression processor operates on the princi -
ple that the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the time convolution of two sequences 
is equal to the product of the discrete Fourier transforms of each of the sequences. If 
M range samples are to be provided by one processor, the length of the DFT must 
exceed M plus the number of samples in the reference waveform minus one to achieve 
an aperiodic convolution. These added M samples are filled with zeros in the refer -
ence waveform DFT. For extended range coverage, repeated processing operations are 
required with range delays of M samples between adjacent operations using the over -
lap-save convolution technique.49,54 This processor can be used with any waveform, 
and the reference waveform can be offset in doppler frequency to achieve a matched 
filter at this doppler frequency.
Pulse Compression Radar Examples.  There are many radars under develop -
ment or deployed that utilize some of the pulse compression waveforms previously dis -
cussed. Advances in digital signal-processing technology have enabled a wider variety 
of waveform implementations. For example, radar systems are no longer limited to the 
LFM waveform; instead, radar system capabilities can be extended to take advantage 
of the more complex processing associated with the nonlinear FM waveform.
AN/TPS-59 and AN/FPS-117 Surveillance Radars.55 The AN/TPS-59 and AN/
FPS-117 are a family of L band, long-range surveillance radars that employ LFM 
waveforms. The antenna is mechanically rotated in azimuth, and electronic pencil-
beam scanning is performed in elevation. The transmission utilizes two time-sequenced 
LFM pulses of different frequencies in order to create Swerling Case 2 target statistics. 
Both radars employ frequency-domain digital pulse compression processing.
Air Surveillance and Precision Approach Radar System.  The Air Surveillance 
and Precision Approach Radar System (ASPARCS) is intended to provide the next-
generation air traffic control (ATC) radar, as part of the Multi-Mission Surveillance 
Radar (MMSR) family of ATC radars built by Lockheed Martin Co. Nonlinear FM 
waveforms are used because the targets of interest have relatively low doppler shifts 
(less than Mach 1). Like the AN/FPS-117 radar, this system implements frequency-
domain digital pulse compression processing.
Multi-Mission Radar . The Multi-Mission Radar (MMR) is designed to detect and 
track mortars, artillery, and rockets. This radar uses a nonlinear FM sine-based wave -
form. Digital frequency-domain pulse compression processing is performed. 
ASR-12 Next-Generation Solid-State Air Traffic Control Radar.56
 The ASR-12 ter -
minal airport surveillance radar transmits a 55-µs pulse with peak power of 21 kW to 
provide a single-pulse transmit energy of 1.16 J. Nonlinear frequency modulation is 
used with a pulse compression ratio of 55 to achieve range-resolution equivalent to 
an uncoded 1-µs pulse. The filter matching loss is less than 0.6 dB and typical time

sidelobe levels measured on production hardware are –58 dB. Digital pulse compres -
sion is used. An uncoded 1.1-µs pulse is used to provide coverage for targets within 
the range interval from 0.5 to 5.5 nmi. 
Stretch Pulse Compression.57–60,62 Stretch pulse compression is a technique for 
performing LFM pulse compression of wideband waveforms using a signal processor 
with bandwidth that is much smaller than the waveform bandwidth, without loss of 
signal-to-noise ratio or range resolution. Stretch pulse compression is used for a single 
target or for multiple targets that are located within a relatively small range window 
centered at a selected range. 
Figure 8.28 shows a block diagram of a stretch pulse compression system. The 
LFM waveform has a swept bandwidth B, pulsewidth T, and LFM slope α. The refer -
ence waveform is generated with time delay tR, swept bandwidth BR, pulsewidth TR, 
and LFM slope aR. The reference waveform time delay is typically derived by range 
tracking of a selected target within the range window. The correlation mixer62,63 (CM) 
in Figure 8.29 performs a bandpass multiplication of the received signal by the output 
of the reference waveform generator. The lower sideband at the CM output is selected 
by a bandpass filter (BPF). 
Spectrum analysis is performed when the LFM slopes of the transmit and reference 
waveforms are equal ( a = aR). Reduced-bandwidth pulse compression processing is 
performed if the reference waveform LFM slope is less than the transmit waveform 
LFM slope ( aR < a  ). In both cases, the required processing bandwidth Bp is much 
smaller than the waveform bandwidth. 
Figure 8.29 shows the principle of stretch pulse compression for the case where the 
LFM slopes of the transmit and reference waveforms are equal. The instantaneous fre -
quency is plotted as a function of time at three points in the stretch pulse compression 
system block diagram: (1) correlation mixer input, (2) correlation mixer LO (reference 
waveform generator output), and (3) correlation mixer output (output of bandpass 
filter). Three LFM target signals are shown at the correlation mixer input: target 1 is at 
zero time offset relative to the reference waveform; target 2 is earlier in time than the 
reference waveform; and target 3 is later in time. In each case, the LFM slope for the 
target signals is B/T. The reference waveform applied to the LO port of the CM has 
LFM slope equal to BR/TR = B/T. 
The instantaneous frequency at the correlation mixer output is the difference 
between the instantaneous frequencies at the CM input and LO ports. As a result, the 
CM output signals for the three target signals are uncoded pulses (pulsed CW signals) 
with frequency offset from the mixer IF output fIF given by

where td is the time delay of the midpoint of the signal measured relative to the mid -
point of the reference waveform. For the case shown, where the RF carrier frequency 
is above the carrier frequency of the reference waveform, a positive time delay results 
in a negative frequency offset. The signals at the correlation mixer output are then 
resolved in the frequency domain by spectral analysis processing. 
A typical implementation for the spectral analysis processing includes a second 
frequency conversion following the CM to a final intermediate frequency (IF), anti-
aliasing filtering, direct sampling at the final IF using an analog-to-digital converter 
(ADC), digital down conversion (DDC) to a complex envelope sequence, time-domain 
weighting, and spectral analysis using an FFT padded with zeros.64 Previous imple -
mentations used analog product detectors to extract I and Q baseband signals, with 
separate ADCs in the I and Q baseband channels.

Unequal Transmit and Reference Waveform Slopes.  A stretch processor with 
unequal frequency-slope waveforms requires pulse compression of the residual linear 
FM at the output of the correlation mixer. A linear FM signal with a slope of a in − a R 
occurs at the target range, which is offset in frequency from the IF carrier frequency 
by a R(tR − t). With the range-doppler coupling of the LFM waveform, the apparent 
time delay of this target will be
 tapp = −aR (tR −t)/(a −aR) (8.31)
This result can be interpreted as yielding a time-expansion factor of a R/(a  − a R) 
for the compressed pulse. As for the case of equal LFM slopes, the range window 
width depends on the achievable processing bandwidth.
Stretch Processing Range Resolution Width.  The 6-dB frequency resolution width 
for spectral analysis using a rectangular window of time duration equal to the transmit 
pulsewidth is 
 ∆fT61 21=. (8.32)
The 6-dB time delay resolution width obtained by stretch processing is obtained by 
dividing ∆f6 by |a | to convert to units of time delay:
 τ66 1 21= =∆f
B T B ( / ). (8.33)
Consequently, the 6-dB resolution width achieved by stretch processing is the same 
as that achieved by the matched filter for the LFM waveform. The 6-dB range resolu -
tion width is
 ∆Rc
B61 212=.  (8.34)
Time-domain weighting is utilized in the spectral analysis processing to reduce 
the time sidelobes of the compressed pulse and improve the resolution performance 
when multiple targets are present within the range window. As an example, the use of 
Hamming time-domain weighting reduces the peak time sidelobe level from –13.2 dB 
to –42.8 dB with an increase in the 6-dB frequency resolution width to ∆f6 = 1.81/ T. 
The 6-dB range resolution width for Hamming weighting is
 ∆Rc
B61 812=.  (Hamming Weighting) (8.35)
Range Window Width.  The width of the range window is established by the band -
width of the spectral analysis and the LFM slope of the transmit waveform. Assume a time 
window of width ∆t and a stretch processing bandwidth Bp. A target at the edge of the time 
window yields a frequency offset equal to one-half of the processing bandwidth:

Stretch Pulse Compression Radar Examples.  This section describes three

X-band radar with stretch processing bandwidths of 0.8, 1.6 MHz, and 3.2 MHz. The 
wideband waveform has a swept bandwidth of 1000 MHz, to a pulsewidth of approxi -
mately 250 µs, and a LFM slope B/T ≈ 1000 MHz/(250 µs) = 4 MHz/µs. The range

Radar Transmit Waveforms .2,68,71 –73 The transmitted waveforms used in radar 
are bandpass signals that can be expressed in the form
 x t a t f t t ( ) ( )cos[ ( )] = + 20π φ  (8.38)
where a(t) is the amplitude modulation ( V), f(t) is the phase modulation (rad), and 
f0 is the carrier frequency (Hz). The amplitude and phase modulation functions vary 
slowly compared to the period of the carrier (1/ f0). Consequently, x(t) is a narrowband 
waveform with a bandwidth that is small compared to the carrier frequency .

The bandpass signal is expressed in terms of the complex envelope by

from a point target is

where Ar is a dimensionless amplitude scale factor, td is the target time delay ( s), fd is 
the target doppler shift (Hz), a(t) is the amplitude modulation ( V), f (t) is the phase

by td. The complex exponential exp[ j2p  fd(t – td)] represents a linear phase modulation 
versus time that is impressed on the received echo signal by the doppler shift fd. The 
carrier phase shift is qc = –2p  f0td.
The time delay and doppler shift are expressed in terms of target range and range-

(m) is the carrier wavelength.
Matched Filters .2,74 A matched filter achieves maximum output signal-to-noise 
ratio for a signal received in white noise. The matched filter frequency response for  
a signal u(t) is 
 H f k U f ej f t
mf( ) ( ) =∗ −
121π (8.42)
where k1 is an arbitrary complex constant and U(  f  ) is the spectrum of u(t). The time 
delay t1 is required to exceed the duration of u(t) to achieve a causal impulse response 
that is zero for negative time. The matched filter impulse response is 
 h t k u t tmf( ) ( ) = −∗
1 1 (8.43)
The peak signal-to-noise to mean-noise-power ratio at the output of a filter with 
frequency response H(  f  ) is defined as
 ( )S NA
o
no=02
2σ (8.44)
where Ao is the matched filter output signal amplitude at the peak of the signal and s  2
no 
is the matched filter output noise power. The matched filter output SNR is given by*
 S NE
N()=mf2
0 (8.45)
where E is the energy of the received bandpass signal at the matched filter input ( J), 
and N0 is the one-sided noise power spectrum at the matched filter input (W/Hz). 
Filter Matching Loss.  Filter matching loss Lm is the loss in SNR that results when 
a signal is not processed using a matched filter. The filter matching loss is defined as 
 LS N
S Nm
o=( )
( )mf (8.46)
where ( S/N)o is the SNR at the output of a filter with frequency response H(  f  ) and  
(S/N)mf is the matched filter SNR. The filter matching loss can also be expressed as
 LE N
S Nm
o=( )
( )20 (8.47)
where the matched filter SNR is given by ( S/N)mf = (2E/N0). The filter matching loss is 
≥ 1, where Lm = 1 for the matched filter. The filter matching loss expressed in decibels 
is Lm(dB) = 10log( Lm) and equals 0 dB for the matched filter. 
*  An alternate definition of signal-to-noise ratio is also used in the literature in which the signal power at the peak of 
the waveform is averaged over one cycle of the carrier.75,76 In this case, the average signal power is one-half of the 
peak signal power and the matched-filter output SNR is E/N0.

Ambiguity Functions .2,71,72,77 –79 The autocorrelation† function for a transmit 
waveform with complex envelope u(t) is defined as 
 χ τ τπ
u dj f tf u t u t e dtd ( , ) ( ) ( ) = +∗
−∞∞
∫2  (8.48)
where t is the relative time delay and fd is doppler shift. The relative time delay is 
positive for a target further in range than a reference target, and doppler frequency is  
positive for an incoming target (negative range-rate). The complex envelope u(t)  
is normalized to unit energy 
 | () |u t dt21
−∞∞
∫= (8.49)
The ambiguity function of u(t) is defined as the square magnitude of the autocorrelation 
function
 Ψu d u d f f( , ) | ( , ) | τ χ τ =2 (8.50)
The ambiguity function is interpreted as a surface above the delay-doppler ( t – fd) 
plane. The maximum value of the ambiguity function is unity at the origin ( t = fd = 0):
 Ψ Ψu d u f( , ) ( , ) τ ≤ = 0 0 1 (8.51)
The volume under the ambiguity surface is unity for any waveform u(t):
 
−∞∞
−∞∞
∫ ∫= Ψu d d f d df ( , )τ τ 1 (8.52)
In the general case, where the energy of the complex envelope is not normalized 
to unity, the value of the ambiguity function at the origin is equal to ( 2E)2 where E 
is the energy of the bandpass signal corresponding to u(t), and the volume under the 
ambiguity function is also equal to ( 2E)2. The normalization condition is equivalent to 
the assumption that the energy of the bandpass transmit waveform equals 0.5 J.
Matched Filter Time Response.  The matched filter time response to a target 
with doppler shift fd can be expressed in terms of the autocorrelation function. The 
matched filter impulse response with k1 = 1 and t1 = 0 is 
 h t u tmf( ) ( )*= −  (8.53)
The matched filter input signal is assumed to have zero time delay and a doppler 
shift fd:
 s t u tej f td ( ) ( )=2π (8.54)
†  The terminology for this function is not standardized in the literature. Woodward69 uses the term correlation func -
tion. The term time-frequency autocorrelation function is used by Spafford.80 The signs associated with t  and fd 
within the integrand also differ in the literature. The standardized definition proposed by Sinsky and Wang78 is 
used in this chapter.

The matched filter output signal y(t) is found by convolution of s(t) with the 
matched filter impulse response hmf(t):
 y t u tu t t e dtj f td ( ) ( ) ( ) = ′ ′ − ′

Comparison of this result with the definition of the autocorrelation function shows 
that the matched filter response can be expressed as
 y(t) = Xu(−t, fd) (8.56)
As a result, the matched filter time response for a target with doppler frequency fd 
is a time-reversed version of the autocorrelation function.
Conditions for Target Resolution in Time Delay and Doppler Frequency .72,78   
Assume that two targets with equal radar cross sections are present at the same angular 
position. The first target (termed the reference target ) is located at the origin of the 
delay-doppler plane with zero relative time delay and zero doppler frequency, and the 
second target is at relative time delay t  and doppler frequency fd. The relative time delay 
is positive when the second target is farther in range than the reference target and the 
doppler frequency is positive for an incoming target. The matched-filter output power 
for the reference target is proportional to the ambiguity function and is given by
 Pref = Ψu (0,0) = 1 (8.57)
The matched filter output power for the second target, evaluated at the peak of the 
reference target, is 
 P2 = Ψu (t, fd) (8.58)
The second target is unresolved from the reference target at locations in the delay-
doppler plane where Ψu(t, fd) ≈ 1.
