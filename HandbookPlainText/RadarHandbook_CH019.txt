19.1 INTRODUCTION
Standard operational meteorological doppler radars have become familiar observa -
tional tools to radar engineers as well as the general public since their introduction by 
the United States National Weather Service (NWS) in the 1950s and are widely used 
by weather forecasters in the public and private sectors. Major technical improvements 
were introduced in the 1990s when the NWS, the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), and 
the U.S. Air Force joined together to install the next generation national network of 
WSR-88D doppler radars (commonly called Nexrad radars). Also in the 1990s the FAA 
installed the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) system at  major airports in the 
U.S. The federal agencies have subsequently implemented many technical upgrades 
to the Nexrad and TDWR networks to improve their performance for public warnings 
and aviation safety.1,2 In contrast to the WSR-57 and WSR-74C radars they replaced, 
the WSR-88D systems provide quantitative and automated real-time information on 
storms, precipitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, and a host of other important weather phe -
nomena with higher spatial and temporal resolution than ever before.3,4 In the aviation 
community, TDWR radars provide crucial information for providing safe departures 
and landings at the major airports by detecting hazardous wind shear events such as 
microbursts, strong gust fronts, and other performance reducing wind hazards.5,6,7
V arious other types of meteorological radars exist. The Nexrad long-range weather sur -
veillance radars are frequently supplemented by (typically) smaller medium-range weather 
radars operated by TV stations for local observations.8 In addition to the familiar com -
mercial airborne weather avoidance and observation radars, airborne hurricane monitoring 
provides detailed forecasts and warnings for approaching coastal hurricanes.9 And verti -
cal pointing wind profiling fixed-beam systems are routinely used to obtain continuous 
profiles of horizontal winds10 whereas spaced-based meteorological radars are measuring 
widespread equatorial precipitation fields and cloud properties.11 Meteorological research 
results are regularly transferred to the operational weather radar community for achiev -
ing higher space and time resolution, for improved data quality, and for the production of 
new weather radar products all of which have led to dramatic improvements in weather 
forecasting. Doppler weather radars measure detailed vector wind fields as well as precipi -
tation fields. Small, highly mobile research radars provide many of the same capabilities 
as the fixed radars.12 Dual polarization techniques13,14 are used for improved quantitative Chapter 19

precipitation measurement, for detecting hail,15 and for discriminating ice particles (snow) 
from water (rain).16 Furthermore, ground-based research radars can now measure atmo -
spheric moisture in the surface boundary layer.17 Airborne research radars provide many 
of these same capabilities with increased coverage and greater mobility.18 This variety of 
applications in both research and operations illustrates the vitality of meteorological radar 
technology and its evolution.
This chapter is intended to introduce the reader to meteorological radar, particularly 
those system characteristics that are unique to meteorological applications. In this 
regard, it should be noted that most meteorological radars appear similar to radars used 
for other purposes. Pulsed doppler systems are far more prevalent than CW radars. 
Primarily, center-fed parabolic dish antennas with focal-point feed and low-noise 
solid-state digital receivers are used. Magnetrons, klystrons, traveling-wave tubes, and 
other forms of transmitter forms are routinely used.
The distinguishing factor between meteorological radar and other kinds of aviation 
or military radars lies in the nature of weather targets, the resulting characteristics of 
the radar signal, and the means by which these weather echoes are processed to sup -
press artifacts and generate only the significant and essential weather information. 
Important meteorological targets occupy a wide range of scattering echo intensities 
(−20 to 70 dBZ) that are distributed in space from short range (< 1 km) to long range 
(> 200 km), close to the surface (100 m) to the top of the atmosphere where weather 
is important (20 km), and typically occupy a large fraction of the several millions 
of spatial resolution cells observed by the radar. Moreover, it is necessary to make 
quantitative measurements of the received signal characteristics in each of these cells, 
or “weather targets,” to estimate such parameters as precipitation rate, precipitation 
type, air motion, turbulence, and wind shear.19 In addition, because a high percentage 
of radar resolution cells contain useful information, meteorological radars require fast 
digital signal processors, effective means for suppressing artifacts caused by the data 
density, high data-rate recording systems, and informative displays of this informa -
tion. Thus, whereas many non-weather radar applications call for detection, tracking, 
and detailed characterization of relatively fewer number of desired targets in a field 
of widespread weather, ground, sea, decoy, and bird clutter, the meteorological radars 
focus on making accurate estimates of the nature of the “weather clutter” itself. Both 
aviation/military and weather radars require heavy processing activity, but the volume 
of data for assimilation, recording, and display of weather radars is often much larger 
since different essential information must be extracted for a large number of antici -
pated users when measuring widespread weather systems.
The discussion herein refers to a number of useful texts and references for the reader. 
However, the classic Radar Observation of the Atmosphere  by Lou Battan20 deserves 
special mention for its clarity and completeness and remains a standard for courses in 
radar meteorology. The Battan Memorial and 40 th Anniversary Radar Meteorology  
Conference  produced a collection of review papers, Radar in Meteorology,21 covering 
the first four decades of radar meteorology from the historical, technological, scientific, 
and operational perspectives. Bean et al.22 in Skolnik’s first Radar Handbook  addressed 
the problem of weather effects on radar. Doviak and Zrnic ´23 place special emphasis on 
doppler aspects of meteorological radar, whereas Bringi and Chandra24 emphasize all 
aspects of polarimetric radars and Lhermitte25 focuses on millimeter wave (cloud) radars. 
Rinehart’s Radar for Meteorologists26 gives a broad and easily comprehendible over -
view of all aspects of weather radar. The IEEE Geoscience and Electronics Special Issue

Meischner’s Weather Radar29 provide an evolving perspective on many aspects of meteo -
rological radars by technological and scientific leaders. Finally, perhaps the broadest and 
most complete set of references on progress in the field can be found in the series of 
Proceedings and Preprints of the (International) Conferences on Radar Meteorology30 
sponsored by the American Meteorological Society (AMS). These documents can 
be found in many technical libraries and also can be obtained online. In addition, the 
Proceedings of the European Conferences on Radar Meteorology31 provides excellent 
reference material.
19.2 THE RADAR EQUATION FOR 
METEOROLOGICAL TARGETS
The received power Pr from a radar point target can be derived from any of a variety 
of expressions that are applicable to radar in general.23,26,32 For a single point target, a 
simple form that is readily derived is
 Prr=βσ
4 (19.1)
where b is a constant dependent upon radar system parameters (transmitted power Pt, 
antenna system gain G, and wavelength l), r is the range to the point target, and s is 
the radar cross section (RCS).*
It is in the calculation of s for distributed meteorological targets that the radar 
equation differs from that for point targets. For distributed targets like rainfall the RCS 
may be written
 s = hV (19.2)
where h is the radar reflectivity in units of cross-sectional area per unit volume and V 
is the volume sampled by the radar. h can itself be written as
 η σ=
=∑ i
iN
1 (19.3)
where N is the number of scatterers per unit volume and si is the backscattering cross 
section of the ith point scatterer. In general, the meteorological scatterers can take on 
a variety of forms, which include water droplets, ice crystals, hail, snow, and mixtures 
of the above.
Mie33 developed a general theory for the energy backscattered by an optical plane 
wave impinging on conducting spheres in colloidal suspension. The same theory applies 
to spherical raindrops falling through the atmosphere for which the backscattered energy 
is a function of the wavelength ( l) of the incident energy and the radius ( a) and complex 
index of refraction ( m) of the particle. The ratio 2 pa/l determines the dominant scatter -
ing properties of the particle. Spherical water droplets in air that are large relative to the 
wavelength scatter in the so called optical region; droplets on the order of the same size 
as the wavelength scatter in the so called resonant scattering region; and droplets small 
relative to the wavelength scatter in the so-called Rayleigh region.
* By convention in this chapter, we shall use r for range and R for rainfall rate.

In radar meteorology, it is common to use the dimensions of millimeters for drop 
diameter Di and to consider the summation to take place over a unit volume of size  
1 m3 to yield a volume density expression. Therefore, the conventional unit of Z is 
in mm6/m3. For ice particles, Di is sometimes expressed as the diameter of the water 
droplet that would result if the ice particle were to melt completely. However, the radar 
scattering process for the many shapes and temperatures of ice particles is extremely 
complicated and a definitive generalized expression cannot be given.
It is often convenient to treat the drop or particle size distribution as a continuous 
function with a number density N(D), where N(D) is the number of drops per unit 
volume having diameters between D and D + dD. In this case, Z is given by the sixth 
moment of the particle size distribution,
 Z n D D dD =∞∫( )6

If the radar beam is filled with scatterers, the sample volume of V is given10  
approximately by

where q and f are the azimuth and elevation beamwidths, c is the velocity of light, and 
t is the radar pulse width. Substituting Eqs. 19.3 and 19.9 into Eq. 19.2, we see that the 
RCS for the distributed weather scatterer is directly proportional to the pulse volume 
as determined by the pulse length and antenna beam at the target range.
Then, combining Eqs. 19.2, 19.6, and 19.9 and substituting into Eq. 19.1 gives

r=′ (19.10)
This expression illustrates that for the distributed weather target the received power 
is (1) a function only of b  ′ (a constant dependent upon all the radar system and physi -
cal parameters), (2) directly proportional to the radar reflectivity factor Z, and most 
significant, (3) inversely proportional to r2 (not r4 as in the case of point targets).
The radar system parameters included in b in Eq. 19.1 include the peak transmit 
power Pt, the antenna system gain G twice (once for transmitting and once for receiv -
ing), and the wavelength l. We include all antenna system losses in this antenna sys -
tem gain factor (radome, waveguide, rotary joints, etc.) since all the measurements 
must be referenced to the same point in the radar system—usually at a coupler near 
the circulator. Because the antenna gain is not uniform over the beamwidth, assuming 
a uniform gain can lead to errors in the calculation of Z. Using a similar derivation, 
Probert-Jones34 took this into account, assumed a gaussian shape for the antenna beam, 
and derived the following equation for the received power:

where 2ln2 is the correction for the gaussian-shaped beam. By substituting Eqs. 19.3, 
19.6, and 19.7 into Eq. 19.11, the received power can be expressed in terms of the 
reflectivity factor Z and range r as

( ln ) (19.12)
Because the receiving filter suppresses some of the received signal power, Pr must 
be reduced by Lr, which depends on the details of the transmitted spectrum and the 
receiver filter but is usually a factor of about 1.6 (2 dB) for a typical waveform and 
“matched filter.” Solving for the radar reflectivity factor Z gives
 Z = [1024 ln2 l2 Lr/Pt G2 q f c t p  3 |K|2] Pr r2  (19.13)
where the reflectivity factor is expressed in terms of the received power and range.
One must be careful to use consistent units in Eq. 19.13. If meter-kilogram-seconds 
(mks) units are used, the calculation of Z will have dimensions of m6/m3. Conversion 
to the more convenient units of mm6/m3 requires that Z be multiplied by the factor 1018. 
Furthermore, expressing Pr and r in common units of dBm (dB relative to 1 milliwatt) 
and km requires that Z also be multiplied by 103. Because Z values of interest can range 
over several orders of magnitude, a logarithmic scale is often used. Thus,
 dBZ = C + Pr (dBm) + 20 log r (km) (19.14)

where C (isolated in brackets in Eq. 19.13) is the so called Weather Radar Constant 
with Pr expressed in dBm and r in km. Typical values of C are 65 to 75 dB for the 
operational weather radars. It is clear that for fixed range and received power, a lower 
value of the radar constant C allows a smaller reflectivity value in dB Z to be observed. 
Thus, smaller values of C correspond to more sensitive radars.
This equation can be used to measure the reflectivity factor Z when the antenna 
beam is filled, when the small scattering particle Rayleigh approximation is valid, and 
when the scatterers are in either the ice or the water phase. Because all these condi -
tions are not always satisfied, it is common to use the term Ze, the effective reflectivity 
factor, in place of Z. When Ze is used, it is generally understood that the above condi -
tions are assumed. Practitioners in the field of radar meteorology often use Ze and Z 
interchangeably, albeit incorrectly.
Another factor we have ignored in the derivation of the radar equation is attenua -
tion by precipitation and atmospheric gasses. At 10 cm wavelengths the attenuation is 
usually not significant; however, at 5, 3, and 2 cm and especially the yet shorter mm 
wavelengths, atmospheric attenuation must be accounted for in the radar equation by 
adding an additional range dependent term La. The following section gives details on 
estimating this attenuation in commonly encountered conditions.
Finally, it is important to note the Z values are of meteorological significance 
because they are directly related to cloud properties and actual rainfall rates R as 
described later in this chapter. Z values in nonprecipitating clouds as small as  
–40 dB Z are of interest for cloud physics studies. In the optically clear, lower atmo -
spheric boundary layer, “clear air” Z values of the order –20 dB Z to 20 dB Z are typical 
and frequently originate from insects and birds.35,36 In rain Z may range from about  
0–10 dB Z to as much as 60 dB Z, with a 55 to 60 dB Z rain being of the type that can 
cause severe flooding. Severe hailstorms may produce Z values higher than 70 dB Z. 
Many operational radar types are designed to detect those Z values that produce mea -
surable precipitation (0 to 60 dB Z) and “clear air” echoes to 100 km where the Earth’s 
curvature prevents surface-based measurements. Thus, being able to measure strong 
precipitation echoes at short range and also weak precipitation echoes at long range 
requires radar receivers having a total dynamic range of 90–95 dB whereas measuring 
weak echoes in the presence of strong ground clutter requires as large an instanta -
neous dynamic range (> 60 dB) as possible. More recent operational radars and most 
research radars attempt to achieve the most sensitivity possible and can detect mini -
mum reflectivity values of –40 dB Z or less at short ranges (e.g., 1 km).
Operational radars in the past have employed sensitivity time control (STC) to 
reduce gain at short range and compensate for strong nearby echoes; however, recent 
radars tend not to use STC techniques since receiver dynamic ranges are adequate to 
cover important weather echo intensities at the necessary ranges. Research radars have 
rarely used STC owing to the attendant loss of sensitivity at short ranges.
19.3 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Four of the more significant factors that affect the design of meteorological radars are 
attenuation, range ambiguities, velocity ambiguities, and ground or sea clutter. The 
combination of these factors, along with the need to obtain adequate spatial resolu -
tion, leads to a wavelength selection in the range of 3 to 10 cm for most precipitation 
based applications.

Attenuation Effects.  Attenuation has at least two negative effects on meteoro -
logical radar signals. First, making accurate quantitative measurements of the back -
scattered energy from precipitation at ranges farther than any intervening precipitation 
becomes very difficult. This inability to precisely measure the true backscattering cross 
section requires that quantitative measurements of precipitation rates be corrected for 
attenuation when possible.
Second, if the attenuation due to precipitation or the intervening medium is suf -
ficiently great, the signal from a precipitation cell behind a region of strong absorp -
tion may be totally suppressed. One example of the potentially serious consequences 
of very strong absorption is the impact it might have on aviation storm avoidance 
radars, most of which are in the 3-cm band. It is common for short wavelength on-
board aviation weather radars to not detect intense convective cells behind closer, high 
attenuation thunderstorms.  Severe storms with high precipitation rates also cause high 
attenuation even at 5-cm wavelengths, as noted by Hildebrand37 and Allen et al.38
In some meteorological radar applications, it is desirable to attempt to measure 
attenuation along selected propagation paths. This is done because absorption is 
related to liquid-water content and can provide useful information for the detection of 
such phenomena as hail, in accordance with the dual-wavelength technique described 
by Eccles and Atlas39 and Vivek et al.40
In the following subsections, quantitative expressions relating attenuation to 
precipitation are given. Much of this is taken from Bean, Dutton, and Warner22 and 
Lhermitte.25 Battan20 and Oguchi41 are also excellent sources for additional informa -
tion on the absorbing properties of precipitation.
Attenuation by Water Vapor.  Atmospheric water vapor may take on values up to 
25 g/m3 and give variable attenuation depending on the water vapor content. However, 
at typical weather radar wavelengths longer than 3 cm, the attenuation is less than a 
few hundredths dB/km and is usually ignored. Gaseous oxygen contributes only a 
minor absorption effect at these centimeter wavelengths and is also usually ignored.
Attenuation in Clouds.  Cloud droplets are regarded here as those water or ice 
particles having radii smaller than 100 µm (0.01 cm). For wavelengths of incident 
radiation well in excess of 0.5 cm, the attenuation depends primarily on the liquid-
water content and is independent of the drop-size distribution. The generally accepted 
equations for attenuation by clouds usually show the moisture component of the equa -
tions in the form of the liquid-water content (grams per cubic meter). Observations42 
indicate that the liquid-water concentration in clouds generally ranges from 1 to  
2.5 g/m3, although Weickmann and Kampe43 have reported isolated instances of cumu -
lus congestus clouds (high towering convective clouds that frequently produce heavy 
precipitation) with water contents of 4.0 g/m3 in the upper levels. In ice clouds, the 
water content rarely exceeds 0.5 and is often less than 0.1 g/m3. The attenuation due 
to cloud droplets may be written
 K = K1M (19.15)
where K = attenuation, dB/km
 K1 = attenuation coefficient, dB/(km ⋅ g/m3)

Values of K1 for ice and water clouds are given for various wavelengths and tempera -
tures by Gunn and East44 in Table 19.1.
Several important facts are demonstrated by Table 19.1. The decrease in attenua -
tion with increasing wavelength is clearly shown. The values change by about an order 
of magnitude for a change of l from 1 to 3 cm. The data presented here also shows 
that attenuation in water clouds increases with decreasing temperature. Ice clouds 
give attenuations about two orders of magnitude smaller than water clouds of the 
same water content. The attenuation of microwaves by ice clouds can be neglected for 
practical purposes.
Attenuation by Rain.  Ryde and Ryde45 calculated the effects of rain on microwave 
propagation and showed that absorption and scattering effects of raindrops become 
more pronounced at the higher microwave frequencies, where the wavelengths and 
the raindrop diameters are more nearly comparable. In the 10-cm band and at shorter 
wavelengths, the effects are appreciable, but at wavelengths in excess of 10 cm, the 
effects are greatly decreased. It is also clear that suspended water (cloud) droplets and 
rain have an absorption rate in excess of that of the combined oxygen and water-vapor 
absorption.46
In practice, it has been convenient to express rain attenuation as a function of the 
precipitation rate R, which depends on the liquid-water content and the fall velocity of 
the drops, the latter in turn depending on the size of the drops. Ryde47 studied the attenu -
ation of microwaves by rain and deduced, by using Laws and Parsons’s48 drop size 
distributions, that this attenuation in decibels per kilometer can be approximated by

Medhurst49 shows that α = 1 is a good assumption in many cases. The path loss 
per mile for the three frequency bands of 4, 6, and 11 GHz is shown in Figure 19.1. 
Lhermitte25 extends this early work to higher frequencies, confirming the relationship 
and describing the effect of the drop-size distribution on the attenuation rate. He also 
reviews more recent empirical data.
The greatest uncertainty in prediction of attenuation rates caused by rainfall, 
when theoretical formulas are used as a basis for calculation, is the extremely lim -
ited knowledge of drop-size distributions in rain of varying fall rates under differ -
ing climatic and weather conditions. Lhermitte25 and Uijlenhoet et al.50 thoroughly 
review the evolution of analytic expressions for drop-size distributions, describing 
the Marshall-Palmer experiment and their resulting exponential distribution and the 
more general three-parameter Gamma distribution. They also review the depen -
dence of the parameters defining the distribution to the rain rate and to the type 
of rainfall. There is little evidence that rain with a known rate of fall has a unique 
drop-size distribution, although Burrows and Attwood’s studies seem to indicate that 
a certain most probable drop-size distribution can be attached to rain of a given rate 
of fall.51 Results of this study are shown in Table 19.2, which gives the percentage 
of total volume of rainfall occupied by raindrops of different diameters and varying 
rainfall rates (millimeters per hour). In the basis of these results, the absorption cross 
section of different rain rates is shown in Table 19.3. This table gives the decibel 
attenuation per kilometer for different rainfall rates for radar wavelengths between 
0.3 and 10 cm.

Since the total-attenuation cross section52 depends on the temperature (because of 
its effects on the dielectric properties of water), it is important to evaluate the attenu -
ation of rains whose drops are at different temperatures from those in the preceding 
tables. Table 19.4 contains the necessary data relative to the change of attenuation with 
temperature and can be used with Table 19.3.
To determine total attenuation caused by rainfall through a particular precipitation 
path, something must be known or assumed about the nature of the precipitation itself 
and, consequently, about how its rainfall rates and drop sizes are distributed in three 
dimensions.
A systematic vertical variation of R, decaying with height above a measured sur -
face value, seems to be appropriate in stratiform53 rainfall, which is rain having a 
widespread and continuous nature. Such widespread rainfall is usually triggered by Drop Diameter D, cmPrecipitation Rate R, mm/h

can be assumed to be appropriate under continuous rainfall conditions.54 R0 is the sur -
face rainfall rate, h is the height above the Earth’s surface, and d is a constant, equal 
to about 0.2. Convective precipitation, however, shows a quite different nature. For 
example, the presence of virga53 (precipitation aloft but evaporating before reaching 
the surface) associated with so many shower-type clouds in dry climates indicates that 
convective shower rainfall profiles are much more difficult to model.
Attenuation by Hail . Ryde47 concluded that the attenuation caused by hail is 
one-hundredth of that caused by rain and that ice-crystal clouds cause no sensible 
attenuation and show very small attenuation even at the excessive rate of fall of 5 in/h. 
However, the scattering by ice spheres surrounded by a concentric film of liquid water 
having a different dielectric constant does not give the same effect that Ryde’s results 
for dry particles would indicate.55 For example, when one-tenth of the radius of an ice 
sphere of radius 0.2 cm melts, scattering of 10-cm radiation is approximately 90% of 
the value that would be scattered by an all-water drop.
At wavelengths of 1 and 3 cm with 2 a = 0.126 ( a = radius of drop), Kerker, Langleben, 
and Gunn55 found that particles attained total attenuation cross sections corresponding to 
all melted particles when less than 10% of the ice particles was melted. When the melted TABLE 19.4  Correction Factor (Multiplicative) for Rainfall Attenuation51

mass reached about 10 to 20%, the attenuation was about twice that of a completely 
melted particle. These calculations show that the attenuation in the melting of ice imme -
diately under the 0 °C isotherm can be substantially greater than in the snow region just 
above and, under some circumstances, greater than in the rain below the melting level. 
Further melting cannot lead to much further enhancement, apparently, and may lead to a 
lessening of the reflectivity of the particle by bringing it to sphericity or by breaking up 
the particle. Melting of ice particles produces enhanced backscatter, and this effect gives 
rise to the observed elevated bright band 53 near the 0 °C isotherm.
Lhermitte25 discusses hail attenuation for shorter wavelength radars when resonant 
region (Mie) scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism. Using accepted size 
distributions of dry hail, he shows attenuation rates over the frequency interval of 
3–150 GHz that are negligible at the lower frequencies but rise asymptotically to about 
3 dB/km at frequencies above 100 GHz.
Attenuation by Fog.  The characteristic feature of a fog is the reduction in visibil -
ity. Visibility53 is defined as “the greatest distance in a given direction at which it is just 
possible to see and identify with the unaided eye (1) in the daytime, a prominent dark 
object against the sky at the horizon and (2) at night a known, preferably unfocused, 
moderately intense light source.” Although the visibility depends upon both drop size 
and number of drops and not entirely upon the liquid-water content, in practice the 
visibility is an approximation of the liquid-water content and, therefore, may be used 
to estimate radio-wave attenuation.56
On the basis of Ryde’s work, Saxton and Hopkins57 give the figures in Table 19.5 
for the attenuation in a fog or clouds at 0 °C temperature. The attenuation varies with 
the temperature because the dielectric constant of water varies with temperature; 
therefore, at 15 °C and 25 °C the figures in Table 19.5 should be multiplied by 0.6 and 
0.4, respectively. It is immediately noted that cloud or fog attenuation is an order of 
magnitude greater at 3.2 cm than at 10 cm and that nearly another order of magnitude 
increase occurs between 3.2 and 1.25 cm.
Range and Velocity Ambiguities.  Weather radars utilize a sequence of pulses 
to measure the radar reflectivity and doppler characteristics. Because the pulsing rate 
typically determines the sampling frequency for doppler quantities on a constant puls -
ing rate radar, the unambiguous doppler frequency (Nyquist frequency) for a fixed 
pulse-repetition-frequency (PRF) radar is given by
 FNyq = ± PRF/2 (19.20)
where PRF is the pulse repetition frequency. Simultaneously, the unambiguous range 
interval is given by
 Rc
a=⋅2 PRF (19.21)

and the product FNyq Ra is simply
 F Rc
Nyq a=4 (19.22)
Since the doppler shift f and the target radial velocity v are linearly related, the 
unambiguous velocity is related to the Nyquist frequency by
 V Fa=λ
2Nyq (19.23)
It follows that the product of unambiguous velocity and unambiguous range is
 V Rc
a a=λ
8 (19.24)
For constant PRF radars, this product is maximized by maximizing l, the transmit -
ted wavelength. Thus, using longer wavelengths allows optimizing the PRF by trad -
ing unambiguous range for unambiguous velocity. For standard constant PRF radars,  
10-cm wavelengths have been widely chosen for most precipitation measurements 
of interest in which design parameters such as radar beamwidth, size of antenna, and 
attenuation effects may be made acceptable.
Ground Clutter Effects.  Many meteorological radar applications call for the 
detection of precipitation echoes in the presence of ground clutter. Specifically, pre -
cipitation measurements near the ground are of extreme interest in agricultural and 
hydrological applications as well as information for the general public. Applications 
in which ground clutter is serious relates to the ground-based radar detection of low-
level wind shear at airports and measuring precipitation near the ground in mountain -
ous terrain for flash flood warnings. Both the Nexrad and Terminal Doppler Weather 
Radar (TDWR) network radars have been designed to assure clutter suppression in 
excess of 40 dB.7,58
Although ground clutter cannot be eliminated, its effect can be mitigated through 
careful design. The primary approach is to use an antenna with low sidelobes, par -
ticularly in elevation, which will suppress the clutter component of the input echo 
when the main beam is slightly above the horizon. A second approach is using shorter 
wavelengths. Shorter wavelengths result in improved signal-to-clutter ratios owing 
to the fact that the Rayleigh scattered weather signal power is inversely proportional 
to l4, whereas the ground clutter return is only weakly dependent on wavelength. If 
one assumes that the clutter signal is wavelength independent and the antenna beam -
width is fixed, it can be shown that the weather-signal-power to clutter-power ratio is 
inversely proportional to l2.
Weather radars typically use digital signal processing techniques to implement 
clutter filters that suppress near zero velocity clutter echoes.59 These filters may be 
implemented using either a time domain clutter filter applied to the I and Q radar 
video data (one form of which is sometimes called a delay line canceler  from its early 
analog implementation) to suppress the zero velocity ground clutter components or a 
frequency domain doppler power spectrum (a digital “filter bank”) to achieve the same 
effect.32 The time domain filters for mechanically scanned weather radars are usually 
infinite impulse response (IIR) filters with narrow, but adjustable, widths up to a few 
m/s and having suppression levels of 40–60 dB and very steep transition regions.60 
These time domain filters with a frequency notch centered at zero velocity (frequency)

will also suppress weather echo power that may exist in the same velocity region and 
bias all the estimates of reflectivity, velocity, and width.
Spectral domain clutter filters implemented by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), 
on the other hand, suppress the near zero clutter components in the frequency domain 
and may interpolate the remaining spectrum across this region to retain most of the 
underlying (signal or noise) spectral information. An alternative frequency domain 
technique for the Nexrad radar separately models the clutter and weather signal as 
gaussian-shaped spectra and separates these two components of the doppler spectrum 
using digital search algorithms and then removes these clutter components while leav -
ing the underlying weather signal unperturbed.61 Thus, when the gaussian assumptions 
apply, the remaining weather signal spectrum provides an unbiased estimator for all 
the weather parameter spectrum moment estimates.
Typical Weather Radar Designs.  There is no universal weather radar system 
design that can serve all purposes. Airborne weather radars are constrained by size 
and weight limitations. Ground-based radars may be constrained by cost and siting 
considerations. Severe storm warning radars require long range and high unambigu -
ous velocity and then must penetrate very heavy rain, thus dictating long wavelengths. 
Radars designed for studies of nonprecipitating clouds typically use short wave -
lengths62,63 (8 mm and 3 mm) in order to achieve sufficient sensitivity to detect small 
cloud particles of the order of 10–100 µm at sufficiently small resolution volumes. 
Sensitive, short-range FM-CW radars64 having high average power can be used to 
obtain very high range resolution for detecting very thin scattering layers in the clear 
air boundary layer.
Most meteorological radars are pulsed radars having doppler capability. Ground-
based radars used for severe storm research and warnings normally use S-band  
(∼3 GHz) or C-band ( ∼5.5 GHz) transmitters. Airborne weather avoidance and precip -
itation radars primarily use X band ( ∼10 GHz) due to size limitations and occasionally 
C-band transmitters to minimize attenuation. Airborne and ground cloud radars and 
spaceborne radars encompass the mm-wavelengths at Ku band (~15 GHz), Ka band 
(~35 GHz), and W band (~94 GHz).
Beamwidths of ≤ 1° are commonly used for longer-range radars. Admittedly, this 
is somewhat arbitrary, but the choice of 1 ° is based upon several decades of experi -
ence. A 1 ° beam will provide a cross-range resolution of 1 km at a range of 60 km. 
Because thunderstorms contain important spatial features, such as heavy precipita -
tion shafts and updraft cores, with horizontal dimensions of the order 1 to 5 km, a 1 ° 
beam is reasonably well matched to these atmospheric phenomena being observed out 
to ranges of a few hundred km. Shorter-range airborne weather radars often employ 
beamwidths of 2–3 ° as a compromise between wavelength requirements and antenna 
size constraints whereas spaceborne radars may use a fraction of a degree beamwidth 
to retain usable horizontal resolution at typical long ranges (250–500 km).
Operational weather radars normally are capable of short and long pulse operation 
in the range of 0.5 µs to about 6 µs and PRFs between 300 and 3000 Hz for long-
range precipitation radars. Through pulse-width diversity, high resolution is obtained 
(usually at short range) whereas for long-range detection, longer pulses provide 
increased sensitivity and tend to equalize the along-beam and cross-beam resolutions. 
The shorter wavelength Ku-, Ka-, and W-band radars typically use pulse lengths less 
than 1 µs to achieve improved range resolution and PRFs between 3000 and 10,000 
Hz because of the short-range cloud measurements that are limited by attenuation

at these wavelengths.  Space-borne radars also use these higher PRFs but keep track  
of multiple pulses en-route to their weather regions far below the orbital altitudes.
Equation 19.12 shows that the received power is directly proportional to the pulse 
length t. The noise power Pn is conventionally given by
 Pn = kTB (19.25)
where k = Boltzmann’s constant, 1.38 × 10–23 W/(Hz ⋅ K)
 T = receiver noise temperature, K
 B = receiver noise bandwidth, Hz
For a receiver filter matched to the pulse length,
 B≈1
τ (19.26)
Sometimes weather radars will use a short pulse for high PRF doppler processing 
at short ranges and a longer pulse at low PRF for greater sensitivity when perform -
ing long-range surveillance scans to monitor distant weather. Since the transmitted 
peak power is typically constrained to be fixed, then the transmitted average power 
increases linearly with t. Also, the matched filter bandwidth and associated noise 
power decreases inversely with t. If the radar pulse volume is filled with distrib -
uted meteorological scatterers, then the radar cross section of the weather target also 
increases with t (as determined by Equations 19.9 and 19.12) and the signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) of received power is proportional to t2:
 P
P T B Tr
n∝ ≈τ
κτ
κ2
 (19.27)
Thus, under these common conditions increasing the pulse length will increase the 
SNR and the effective radar range. It is important to note that the distributed target 
radar dependence of SNR on t2 is different from the point target radar in which the 
matched filter SNR equals the ratio of pulse energy to noise spectral density (2 E/N0 =  
2Pt t /N0), a linear dependence on t. The squared dependence for distributed scatter -
ers is because the transmit pulse scatters power from all scatterers in the ct/2 pulse 
volume (not just a single point target) thereby increasing the radar cross section of the 
weather scatterer.
PRFs for meteorological radars range from as low as several hundred s–1 for long-
range detection to several thousand s–1 for shorter-wavelength systems attempting to 
achieve high unambiguous velocities. Generally speaking, most meteorological dop -
pler radars are operated in a single PRF mode, compromising the radar’s ability to 
unambiguously resolve either range or velocity. However, the pulsing sequence may 
use a “dual PRF” mode in which groups of constant PRF pulses are transmitted or 
a “dual (staggered) PRT” (pulse repetition time) to resolve both range and velocity 
ambiguities.65 Another approach is to employ a transmitted pulse sequence with ran -
dom66 or deterministic67 phases from pulse to pulse, which allows overlaid echoes to 
be separated. Multiple PRT techniques have also been explored but are not in common 
use.68 Range ambiguities cannot be totally eliminated, but their effects can be signifi -
cantly mitigated through these approaches.
To discuss design details of the common types of meteorological radars is beyond 
the scope of this chapter. Rinehart26 gives a detailed table of system characteristics of

Polarimetric Radar.  Meteorological radars using dual polarization transmit and 
receive both horizontal and vertical polarizations to estimate additional characteris -
tics of the weather targets.13,14,24 Transmitting the two orthogonal polarizations either 
simultaneously (SHV) or transmitting them separately in a predetermined sequence 
and using dual parallel digital receivers (one on each polarization channel) allow esti -
mation of the differential quantities between echoes from the two polarizations. One 
can derive improved rainfall rates (as well as other physical information on the type of 
precipitation) as functions of polarimetric measurements that relate the differences in 
the horizontally and vertically polarized signals. By far the most common polarimet -
ric parameters are the “differential reflectivity” ( Zdr) and “differential phase” ( Φdp), 
which give bulk scattering and propagation characteristics of the meteorological tar -
gets. Letting Eh and Ev denote the complex received signal voltages  that also repre -
sent the received electric fields  at horizontal and vertical polarizations, the important 
polarimetric parameters to be estimated are given below11:

 Differential phase Φdp = <Φv > − <Φh> (19.29)
 Specific differential phase Kdp = d<Φdp> / dr (19.30)
 Co-polar correlation ratio rhv = |< Eh*Ev > | / < E*hEh>½ <E*vEv>½ (19.31)
 Linear depolarization ratio LDR = <Zcx v> / < Zco h> (19.32)
Zh and Zv are the measured reflectivities of the horizontal and vertical co-polar -
ized received signals and Zdr is expressed in dB, whereas Φh and Φv are the measured 
phases of the same polarized received signals. Kdp is the suitably smoothed range 
derivative of the measured differential phase, Φdp, and is usually expressed in deg/km. 
rhv is the co-polar correlation coefficient of Eh and Ev where the phase measurements 
are assumed to be time coincident, which is the case with SHV transmission and recep -
tion. LDR is a ratio of the cross-polar vertical reflectivity ( Zcx v) normalized by the 
co-polar horizontal reflectivity ( Zco h). Because polarimetric measurements add new 
dimensions of radar information and because these measurements are related to the 
physical characteristics of the scatterers, suitable combinations of these data give a 
strong indication of precipitation type (rain, snow, ice particles, sleet, hail, etc)16,71 as 
well as radar echo classification into various categories (precipitation, ground or sea 
clutter, birds and insects, chaff, etc).72
Radar Calibration.  To effectively use radars for accurate precipitation esti -
mates, the conversion of measured reflectivity factor to received echo power must 
be well known. The gains (or conversion constants) of the various radar components 
can be measured using engineering test equipment, manufacturer specifications, and 
field measurements. Calibrating weather radar usually means to accurately specify 
the radar constant in the radar equation and to accurately estimate the received power

measured by the radar system. It also encompasses items such as knowing where the 
scattering volume is in 3D space by knowing antenna pointing angles and accurately 
determining range.
Although floating spheres, tetrahedral reflectors, and other targets of known radar 
cross section may be used,26,73 the important “solar calibration” technique uses the 
solar position to adjust antenna pointing and the radiated solar flux to determine 
antenna gain.74,75 Along with other radar parameter measurements, one can read -
ily determine the radar constant. By injecting test signals of known power, one can 
determine the receiver gain transfer function. For polarimetric radars special care 
is required.76 It has been demonstrated that by measuring the cross-polar powers in 
addition to the solar flux, an accurate estimate of the differential channel calibra -
tion can be obtained.77 The AMS held a very successful Weather Radar Calibration 
Symposium78 documenting all aspects of meteorological radar calibration.
19.4 SIGNAL PROCESSING
To compute the various weather products necessary for forecasting, warning, and other 
operational activities, the first three spectrum moments corresponding to received 
power, mean radial velocity, and doppler spectrum or velocity width must be estimated. 
Keeler and Passarelli79 review standard estimation techniques and errors for spectrum 
moment estimation. For the highest resolution measurements, these spectral moments 
must be computed at each range gate sensed by the radar and converted into meaningful 
meteorological information. The nature of the distributed meteorological target, which 
shall be discussed next, imposes some special requirements not generally considered for 
hard, nonfluctuating targets on the processing techniques to estimate these moments.
It can be shown that the received signal from meteorological targets is well repre -
sented by a narrowband gaussian process.23 This is a direct consequence of the fact 
that (1) the number of scatterers in the pulse volume is large ( >106); (2) the pulse 
volume is large compared with the transmitted wavelength; (3) the pulse volume 
contains multiple point scattering sources, causing all phases on the range from 0 to 
2p to be combined and returned; and (4) the particles are in relative motion due to 
turbulence, wind shear, and their varying fall speeds. 
The superposition of the scattered electric fields from such a large number of par -
ticles (each with different amplitude and random phase) gives rise, through the central 
limit theorem, to a signal with bivariate, or a two dimensional, gaussian probability 
density function. Thus, the fluctuating amplitude of the return signal has a Raleigh sta -
tistical distribution and its phase is uniformly distributed between 0–2 p. Furthermore, 
its intensity (power) is exponentially distributed.80,81 Because all the particles within 
the sample volume are moving with some mean or average radial velocity, there is 
a mean frequency of the doppler spectrum that is shifted from the transmitted fre -
quency. Finally, since the particles are in motion with respect to one another, there is 
also a doppler spread, often referred to as the width of the doppler spectrum. Zrnic 
describes a straightforward technique of synthesizing digital weather radar signals 
from a parameterized doppler spectrum characterizing a specific pulse volume.82 
Doviak and Zrnic23 as well as Bringi and Chandrasekar24 give detailed derivations of 
these relationships, whereas Keeler and Passarelli79 summarize distributed target data 
characteristics and relate them to the sampled data sets representative of weather radar 
and other atmospheric sounding systems.

Spectrum Moment Estimation.  A common Gaussian model of the mean 
received power spectral density of a meteorological signal82 is depicted in Figure 19.5 
and can be interpreted as follows. The received power is simply the integral under the 
curve (the zeroth moment) and is given by
 P S f df S v dvr= =∫ ∫( ) ( )  (19.33)
where f and v are related by f = (2/l)v.
The mean velocity ( v) is given by the first moment of the spectrum:
 vvSv dv
S vdv=∫
∫( )
( ) (19.34)
The spectrum (velocity) width ( sv) is given by taking the square root of the second 
central moment:
 σvv v S vdv
S vdv22
=−∫
∫( ) ( )
( ) (19.35)
Radar meteorologists sometimes refer to σv2 as the spectrum variance because of 
its computational equivalence to the variance of a continuously distributed random 
variable. In short, S(v) is analogous to a probability density function for v since it is 
actually a reflectivity weighted distribution of particle velocities within the scattering 
volume. The term spectrum width  will be used to refer to sv. It is clear, therefore, that 
the doppler spectrum contains the information necessary to measure meteorologically 
important signal parameters. These first three moments are usually referred to as base 
data and often labeled Z, V, and W with the appropriate conversions and units.
In the most general case, quadrature phase detection is used to obtain the real and 
imaginary parts of the complex signal. These are usually digitized in a large number 
of range gates ( ≈1000) at the radar’s pulse repetition frequency. The resultant complex 
time series in each gate can then be processed by using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
to obtain an estimate of the doppler power spectrum83 from which the echo power, 
mean velocity, and spectrum width can be obtained.
FIGURE   19. 5 Gaussian model of the mean doppler power 
spectrum. The three spectral moments (received power, 
radial velocity, and spectrum width) can be estimated from 
the spectrum and are directly related to the meteorological 
variables of interest.

An efficient moment estimation technique was originally described by Rummler 84 
and reinterpreted by Doviak and Zrnic.23 This estimator makes use of the fact that the 
complex autocorrelation function of the received signal has the general form
 R nT P nT jvnTr ( ) ( ) exp =

ρπ
λ4 (19.36)
where r(nT) is the correlation coefficient of the time series data and nT is the  
time lag.
It can be shown that v, the mean velocity, is a function of the first lag R(T)
 vTR T =λ

where Pn is the noise power.
This estimator has been widely used in the past for mean-frequency estimation with 
doppler meteorological radars. The estimates are unbiased in the presence of noise 
when the doppler spectrum is symmetrical. Its greatest appeal, however, is due to its 
computational simplicity. For a pulsed radar, with a pulse repetition period T, R(T) is 
obtained from adjacent pairs of pulses using the simple expression86
 R TNs sk k

 (19.39)
where the sk are the complex in-phase ( I) and quadrature ( Q) signal samples (sampled 
at the radar PRT) at a given range and sk* is its complex conjugate. It is clear that this 
algorithm requires N complex multiplications for a time series of N samples whereas 
the FFT requires N log2 N. This so-called pulse-pair algorithm , therefore, is an effi -
cient spectral moment estimation technique. However, it should be applied only when 
one is certain to have a pure weather signal in white noise; otherwise, other spectral 
components or non-white noise will bias the spectral moment estimates.
For many past operational radars, the pulse-pair processor was the technique of 
choice. However, in many research applications, it remains advantageous for improved 
data quality control purposes to access the full doppler spectrum and remove artifacts 
prior to computing the spectral moments corresponding to the meteorological data 
of interest.79,87 The wind profiling radar community has made extensive use of spec -
tral processing for artifact removal and sensitivity improvement.88 One of the more 
important tasks is estimating the noise floor so as to remove its effect on the spectral 
moment estimates. Two objective techniques are common.89,90 Constantly improving 
programmable digital signal processing chips and signal processing computers make 
it possible for radar meteorologists to implement various types of spectrum process -
ing techniques that vastly improve data quality over the simple pulse pair processing 
algorithm. Furthermore, processors that adapt themselves to a variable environment in 
which they usually operate are feasible. Flexible programming of digital signal proces -
sors permits tailoring of the processor’s characteristics to the application from day to 
day or even beam to beam and gate to gate.

Measurement Accuracy.  Because the received signals are sample functions 
from gaussian random processes, the doppler spectrum and its moments cannot be 
measured exactly in any finite period of time. Consequently, all measurements will be 
somewhat in error, with the error being a function of the properties of the atmosphere, 
the radar wavelength, and the time allocated to the measurement.
The theoretical development of signal estimator statistics is found in Denenberg, 
Serafin, and Peach91 for the FFT technique. Doviak and Zrnic ′23 cover the subject quite 
completely while Keeler and Passarelli79 provide a good summary of all these estimation 
techniques and the respective measurement error expressions. Following are some use -
ful expressions for the mean square error of mean power and mean velocity estimates.
Power Estimation.  It is well known80 that for a gaussian random process using 
square-law signal detection, samples of the mean power Pr of the process are expo -
nentially distributed with variance Pr2.The variation is due to the process itself, not any 
noise associated with the measurement. Given a time T0 (sec) allocated to the measure -
ment and a signal bandwidth sf (Hz), there will be approximately sfT0 independent 
samples of the square of the signal envelope. It follows, therefore, that for the high 
SNR case an estimate of the mean power for this process ˆPr will have a variance or 
mean square error given by
 var(ˆ)PP
Trr
f≈2
0σ (19.40)
Substituting for sf from the expression sf = 2sv/l, where sv is the width of the 
doppler spectrum, Eq. 19.40 becomes
 var(ˆ)PP
Trr
v≈λ
σ2
0 2 (19.41)
This expression is valid for high signal-to-noise cases.
Velocity Estimation . The variance of the mean frequency estimate of the doppler 
spectrum is
 var(ˆ) ( ) fP Tf S f f df
r= + ∫1
2
02 2 (19.42)
This is an interesting result showing that the variance of the estimate ˆf is a func -
tion only of the shape of the doppler spectrum (primarily its spectrum width) and the 
integration time T0 allocated for processing. If the spectrum can be accurately modeled 
by a gaussian shape with variance σf2, Eq. 19.42 reduces to
 var(ˆ)f
Tf=σ
π40 (19.43)
Noting that var(ˆ) ( / )var(ˆ), v f =λ22 we can write
 var(ˆ)v
Tv=λσ

Thus, it is seen that the variance of the mean velocity estimate ˆv is directly propor -
tional to the variance of the doppler spectrum and inversely proportional to the number 
of independent samples, sf T0. Note also that var (ˆ)vis proportional to l, indicating 
that, for the same processing time T0 and for the same sv, the variance of the estimate 
can be reduced by reducing the wavelength, which increases the number of indepen -
dent samples.
Equations 19.42–19.45 are applicable in high signal-to-noise ratio cases. 
Uncertainties in the spectral moment estimates result from the limited observation 
time of the narrow band random process characterizing the meteorological echo. Any 
noise in the measurement further increases the uncertainty. Zrnic ′85 gives the more 
general following expression for the variance of the mean frequency estimate f for the 
pulse-pair estimation technique and a gaussian-shaped spectrum

where r is the correlation coefficient and N/S is the noise-to-signal ratio. Equation 
19.46 applies a single PRF with interpulse period T and assumes that all pulses in the 
interval T0 are used in the estimation algorithm. It reduces exactly to Eq. 19.43 for a 
large SNR and for narrow spectra, i.e., r(T) ≈ 1. The reader is referred to Zrnic ′85 for 
further details regarding the estimation of other moments of the doppler spectrum.
Pulse Compression.  Pulse compression has been infrequently used for meteo -
rological applications because short pulse peak power has not been a limitation on 
weather radar system performance. Keeler and Frush,92 however, described how atmo -
spheric distributed targets may be treated as frozen (fixed) “slabs” of scattering centers 
such that they approximate layers of nonfluctuating scatterers as the coded radar pulse 
propagates through them. Thus, each scattering slab produces a return signal that can 
be compressed by the compression filter in the same way as for individual point targets. 
They pointed out that pulse compression can benefit rapid-scanning radar applications 
in which the desired dwell time of each scattering volume is much shorter than the 
decorrelation time of the weather echoes. In these cases, averaging pulse compressed 
range measurements, instead of integrating over a longer dwell time, provides the 
large number of independent samples needed for accurate measurement in a very short 
beam observation time. Similarly, the effective range resolution over which averag -
ing is performed can be flexible to meet changing observational requirements—short 
range intervals for highly structured heavy rainfall storms (typically convective) and 
longer range intervals for more uniform but weaker rainfall (typically stratiform). In 
other situations where signals are very weak (such as for wind profiler applications 
and clear air boundary layer observations), pulse compression may be used to increase 
system sensitivity93 by increasing the average power of the system using long pulses 
while processing for any desired range resolution. Range resolution and SNR are inde -
pendently determined by the pulse compression waveform design parameters.
A note of caution is in order when considering pulse compression for meteoro -
logical radars, relating to the matter of range sidelobes. Careful design is necessary 
to minimize these sidelobes, just as antenna sidelobes should be minimized, in order

to mitigate the effects of interpretive errors caused by wide dynamic range distributed 
weather targets.94,95 Amplitude, frequency, and phase shaping of the transmitted pulse 
along with special sidelobe suppression/compression filters in the receiver processor 
allow range sidelobes to be suppressed by more than 50 dB over a significant doppler 
interval—tens of meters per second.96 These compression filters are not matched to the 
transmit waveform; therefore, the SNR degrades somewhat and possible loss of range 
resolution in the main beam may occur.95 However, these losses are tolerable for many 
meteorological measurements of interest.
Whitening.  Pulse compression involves increased transmit bandwidth that is 
frequently difficult to have allocated and may limit its use at S band and C band for 
operational applications. A fixed bandwidth technique for increasing range resolution 
and the number of independent samples is the process of sampling the transmit pulse at 
an interval several times shorter than its duration and using a linear predictive whitening 
filter  97 to remove the correlated information from the oversampled data.98,99 This whit -
ening process increases the number of independent samples for range averaging that 
allows improved parameter estimation accuracy but at a cost of significantly reduced 
SNR. The higher noise bandwidth in the receiver required by the higher rate sampling 
and the whitening filter noise enhancement cause the SNR to be reduced by a factor of 
approximately L2 where L is the increased sampling factor.100 Stated another way, the 
whitening filter effectively shortens the transmit pulse (by L) while passing the increased 
receiver noise power (by L) thereby trading range resolution for SNR. Fortunately, for 
precipitation echoes and typical weather radars, the SNR is quite high, and even after 
the whitening process, it remains high enough to effectively utilize the larger number 
of independent samples for improved base data estimates or improved range resolu -
tion measurements.101 On the other hand, if the signal is weak, noise enhancement will 
dominate the whitening process and any advantage is lost. Highly important is the fact 
that the transmit pulse and its bandwidth are not changed; consequently, increased fre -
quency allocation to make use of the higher range resolution is not an issue.
Short Dwell Time Spectra (Maximum Entropy).  Spectral processing of 
weather echoes adds another degree of freedom (the frequency dimension) to the abil -
ity to discriminate signal from ground clutter, other artifacts, and noise, and to estimate 
meteorological parameters of interest. Most frequency domain processing requires 
relatively long IQ data sample sets for discrete Fourier transform analyses, window 
functions, and possible spectral averaging to obtain spectra suitable for quantita -
tive processing.102 Faster scanning radars used for sampling rapidly evolving storms 
requires spectrum analysis techniques that use short dwell time data sets of many fewer 
IQ data samples. Modern spectrum analysis techniques such as the Burg maximum 
entropy103 and the Capon104 maximum likelihood estimators allow using short dwell 
sampled data to obtain stable spectrum estimators. These techniques belong to the 
general class of autoregressive (AR) estimators whereby the observed data are mod -
eled as all-pole filtered white noise rather than a weighted sum of sinusoids according 
to the Fourier model.105 Multiple signals and ground clutter may be resolved the same 
as using Fourier estimators. These short dwell time AR spectra may then be used to 
estimate weather spectral moments the same as the Fourier data model spectrum esti -
mators from which the weather parameters are derived.87
Processor Implementations.  Modern meteorological radars use digital signal 
processing techniques on programmable platforms and interactive color displays

for quantitative precision in interpreting the weather echoes. Modern weather radars 
require large dynamic range to sense strong echo at short range and weak echo at 
long range. Thus, the receiver and processor designs attempt to maintain amplitude 
and phase linearity throughout that range by using a dynamic automatic gain control 
(AGC), whereby the receiver gain and phase are adjusted along the range interval 
through the use of rapidly switched attenuators or, more often, digital compensation. 
Clearly, such rapid switching in the receiver requires careful design in order to avoid 
the affects of switching transients. An approach that avoids transient effects is to use 
two parallel IF receiver channels, each with moderate dynamic range and fixed gains, 
and to sample the signal in the channel that is best matched to the signal strength.
In all those approaches, it is possible to achieve linear dynamic range of greater than 
90 dB and to use floating-point digital processing. The reflectivity, mean doppler velocity, 
and spectrum width can all be estimated digitally from the floating-point samples. The 
processing can be performed with a dedicated digital signal processing computer or by fast 
general-purpose computers combined with special signal processing components using 
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chips or field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. 
Continued technology advances will permit advanced, but mature, signal processing algo -
rithms such as modern spectral processing and adaptive filtering to be implemented.87
19.5 OPERATIONAL APPLICATIONS
As has been demonstrated, meteorological radars measure backscattered power and 
radial velocity parameters. The challenge to the radar meteorologist is to translate these 
measurements, their spatial distributions, and their temporal evolution into quantitative 
assessments of the weather. Serafin and Wilson,1 among others, show how modern 
meteorological radars are used for forecasting the weather. The level of sophistication 
used in interpretation varies broadly, ranging from human interpretation of rudimen -
tary displays to automatic algorithms and modern multidimensional displays to assist 
human interpretation. Expert system approaches106,107 that attempt to reproduce human 
interpretive logical processes have been employed effectively. The degree to which 
automation can be applied is evident in the Nexrad radar system design that produces 
the automated meteorological products shown in Table 19.7.

Precipitation Measurement.  Among the more important parameters to be 
measured is rainfall, having significance to a number of water resource management 
problems related to agriculture, fresh-water supplies, storm drainage, and warning of 
potential flooding. The rainfall rate can be empirically related to the reflectivity factor 
by an expression of the form108
 Z = aRb (19.47)
where a and b are constant and R is the rainfall rate, usually in millimeters per hour. 
Battan20 devotes three full pages of his book to the listing of dozens of Z-R relation -
ships derived by investigators at various locations throughout the world, for various 
weather conditions, and in all seasons of the year. The fact that no universal expression 
can be applied to all weather situations is not surprising when one notes that rainfall 
drop-size distributions are highly variable. For many conditions, the drop-size distri -
bution can be represented by an exponential function
 N(D) = N0 e –ΛD (19.48)
where N0 and Λ are constants and ΛD0 = 3.67 where D0 is the median drop diameter. 
If N(D) is known, the reflectivity factor can be calculated from Eq. 19.8. By using the 
terminal-fall speed data of Gunn and Kinzer,109 the rainfall rate can also be obtained 
and Z related to R as shown in Eq. 19.47. The exponential form of the drop-size distri -
bution generally fits the average of several drop-size distributions that occur over dif -
ferent phases of convective and tropical rainfall and are averaged over space or time. 
However, the “gamma” drop-size distribution represents a better fit to instantaneous, 
natural variations of the drop-size distribution under different conditions. The gamma 
drop-size distribution24 is given as
 N(D) = N0 Dm e –ΛD (19.49)
with m > –1 and ΛD0 = 3.67 + m. The m parameter controls the shape of the distribution 
and when m = 0, the distribution is exponential.
Clearly, a single-wavelength, single-polarization radar can measure only a single 
parameter Z and must assume Rayleigh scattering. Since the rainfall rate depends upon 
two parameters, N0 and Λ, it is not surprising that Eq. 19.47 is not universal. Despite 
this fact, Battan20 lists four expressions as being “fairly typical” for the following four 
types of rain:
   Stratiform rain110 Z = 200 R1.60 (19.50)
 Orographic rain111 Z = 31 R1.71 (19.51)
           Thunderstorm rain112 Z = 486 R1.37 (19.52)
            Snow113 Z = 2000 R2.00 (19.53)
Stratiform53 refers to widespread, relatively uniform rain and uses the well-known 
Marshall-Palmer drop-size distribution. Orographic53 rain is precipitation that is 
induced or influenced by hills or mountains, whereas Thunderstorm53 rain is typical of 
convective precipitation systems. In each of the above expressions, Z is in mm6/m3 and 
R is in mm/h. In Eq. 19.53, R is the precipitation rate of the water-equivalent melted 
snow. Battan20 gives a more complete treatment of this important topic.

Wilson and Brandes114 give a comprehensive treatment of how radar and rain-
gauge data can be used to complement one another in measurements of precipitation 
over large areas. They state that the radar determined storm cumulative precipitation 
measurements are expected to be accurate within a factor of 2 for 75% of the time. 
Accuracies over large areas can be improved to about 30% with the addition of a 
surface rain-gauge network. Although radar measures reflectivity aloft, the primary 
concern is rainfall estimation at the surface. Rain gauge measurements are frequently 
used to adjust the radar reflectivity values.115 Zawadzki116 describes many factors that 
influence rainfall measurement by radar. Joss and Lee117and others118,119,120 use the 
Vertical Profile of Reflectivity (VPR) to estimate the surface rainfall rate with some 
success. Bridges and Feldman121 discuss how two independent measurements (reflec -
tivity factor and attenuation) can be used to obtain both parameters of the drop-size 
distribution and more precisely determine the rainfall rate.
Polarimetric Estimates.  Dual polarization radar has been proven to yield improved 
rainfall estimates as well as other advantages for weather radar.122 Polarimetric radar 
measurements take advantage of the flattened raindrop shape approximated by an 
oblate spheroid (a flattened sphere having a horizontal dimension greater than its verti -
cal dimension), and its propagation and scattering characteristics, to obtain accurate 
rain-rate estimators. Seliga and Bringi123 and Sachidananda and Zrnic124 show how the 
co-polar measurements of Z at horizontal ( Zh) and vertical ( Zv) polarizations can pro -
duce two independent measurements and, therefore, provide more accurate rainfall-rate 
measurements than those related to simple reflectivity. Bringi and Chandra24 give the 
following rain-rate estimators for measurements at 10 cm (S band). Other wavelengths 
have different constants because of Mie factors entering into the calculations and the 
wavelength dependence of phase measurements.
 R(Zh, Zdr) = 0.0067 Zh 0.93 Zdr–3.43 (19.54)
             R(Kdp) = 50.7 Kdp0.85 (19.55)
           R(Kdp, Zdr) = 90.8 Kdp0.93 Zdr–1.69 (19.56)
The reflectivity-based rain-rate estimators corresponding to the Marshall-Palmer 
(Z = 200R1.6) and the common Nexrad WSR-88D ( Z = 300R1.4) relations are
 RMP (Z) = 0.0365 Z0.625 for Marshall-Palmer (19.57)
   R88D (Z) = 0.0170 Z0.714 for Nexrad WSR-88D (19.58)
The polarimetric precipitation measurements bring unique characteristics that 
address not only improved precipitation measurements, but also improved data qual -
ity characteristics.125 The differential reflectivity between the horizontal and verti -
cal polarizations ( Zdr) allows estimating the effective drop size, whereas differential 
phase ( Kdp) gives additional, somewhat independent information on estimation of 
rainfall rates. Kdp is an especially important parameter when the radar is confronted 
with typical contaminants as beam blockage, ground clutter domination, and calibra -
tion errors. Furthermore, Ryzhkov and Zrnic126 have shown that Kdp-based rainfall 
measurements are less dependent on the unknown and variable drop-size distribu -
tion (DSD) than power-based measurements. Furthermore, other inferences from the

polarimetric measurements allow one to estimate the parameters of the gamma func -
tion form of the DSD,127 which may further improve rainfall estimation. And, self 
consistency constraints of the polarimetric precipitation covariance matrix impose 
relatively strict bounds on the absolute reflectivity measurements, allowing one to 
calibrate the reflectivity measurement and make improved rainfall rate estimates.128 
For short wavelength radars, one must consider Mie scattering effects when measur -
ing rainfall rate by reflectivity measurement. Lhermitte25 and Kollias et al.129 give an 
analysis of Mie scattering and show that if the scattering is properly accounted, the 
rainfall measurements are accurate.
Polarimetric radars may be configured in different ways for different measure -
ments. Research radars explore the depolarization ratios by alternating horizontally 
and vertically polarized pulses. However, the preferred configuration for opera -
tional radars is to transmit both horizontal and vertical polarizations simultaneously 
while independently receiving both orthogonal signals for polarimetric processing, 
allowing reception of the important co-polar quantities. The relative phase of each 
transmitted polarization is arbitrary, but the differential magnitude and phase of 
the co-polar received signals in each polarization are sufficient for the polarimetric  
measurements.
It is our opinion that no single topic in radar meteorology has received more 
attention than rainfall rate measurement. Although useful empirical expressions have 
evolved and dual-polarization techniques show significant improvements in accu -
racy, a completely satisfactory approach remains to be developed.
Polarimetric measurements by the WSR-88D radars will allow more accurate 
precipitation measurements and ice-water phase knowledge that is important for 
making improved forecasts, separating winter precipitation into regions of rain and 
snow, and detecting hazardous aircraft icing conditions.130 Implementation of phase-
coding algorithms allow these radars to separate multiple time around (or multi -
ple trip) echoes67,131,132 and to compute dealiased velocities in the range dealiased 
echoes133; to classify and separate precipitation echoes from artifacts as ground clut -
ter, sea clutter, and insects echoes72; to accommodate flexible scan strategies; and 
to incorporate improved data resolution in range and azimuth. These performance 
enhancements are readily achieved by installing greater and more flexible signal and 
data processing power.
Severe Storm Warning.  One of the primary purposes of weather radars is to 
provide timely warnings of severe weather phenomena such as tornadoes, damaging 
winds, flash floods, and landfalling hurricanes. Accurate long-term forecasting of the 
precise location and level of severity of these phenomena, through data assimilation 
and numerical weather prediction techniques, is beyond the present state of the art. 
Operational radars, however, can detect these phenomena and provide local warn -
ings of approaching severe events; they can also detect the rotating mesocyclones 
in severe storms that are precursors to the development of tornadoes at the Earth’s 
surface.134 Ground-based coastal and airborne radars can also measure the severity 
of approaching hurricanes and define their most intense landfall positions for evacu -
ation warnings.135,136
Tornado Detection.  A single doppler radar can measure only the radial compo -
nent of the vector wind field. Hence, exact measurements of vector winds at a point 
are generally not possible. However, rotating winds or vortices can be detected and

their intensities measured by simply measuring the change in radial velocity with 
azimuth angle, as shown in Figure 19.6. The radar scans in azimuth and detects a 
couplet in radial velocity at constant range. The azimuth shear is given simply by the 
expression
 dv
dxv
rr r≈2
α (19.59)
where x is in the direction orthogonal to the radius of the circulation and a is the angle 
subtended by the circulation at range r.
Because mesocyclones may spawn tornadoes and can be many kilometers in diam -
eter, radars with about 1 ° beamwidth have the spatial resolution to detect mesocy -
clones at ranges in excess of 60 km. It should be clear that any mean translational 
motion would change the absolute values of the measured radial velocities but would 
not affect the shear measurement. Azimuthal shear values of the order of 10–2 s–1 
or greater and with vertical extent greater than the diameter of the mesocyclone are 
deemed necessary for a tornado to occur.137
Detection of the tornado vortex itself is not generally possible beyond about 30 km 
using typical weather radar beamwidths, since its horizontal extent may be only a few 
hundred meters. Detection of the radial shear, therefore, is not possible unless the tor -
nado is close enough to the radar to be resolved by the beamwidth. However, in cases 
where the tornado falls entirely within the beam, the doppler spectrum width may be 
used to estimate tornadic intensity. In some cases, both a mesocyclone and its incipient 
tornado can be detected. Wilson and Roesli138 show an excellent early example of a 
tornado vortex signature (TVS) embedded within a larger mesocyclone.
Microbursts.  Fujita and Caracena139 first identified the microburst phenomenon 
as the cause of an airliner crash that took place in 1975. The microburst and its effects 
on an aircraft during takeoff or landing are depicted in Figure 19.7. The microburst is 
simply a small-scale, short-duration downdraft emanating from a convective storm. 
This “burst” of air spreads out radially as it strikes the ground, forming a ring of 
diverging53air about 0.3 to 1 km deep and of the order of 2 to 4 km in diameter with 
divergent winds greater than 10 m/s and lasting less than 20 minutes. Aircraft pen -
etrating a microburst first experience an increase in head wind and then a continu -
ous, performance-robbing decrease in head wind, which can cause the plane to crash 
if encountered shortly before touchdown or just as the aircraft is taking off. More 
complete descriptions of microbursts and their effects on aviation safety are given by 
Fujita140,141 and McCarthy and Serafin.142

Microburst detection, like tornado detection, is accomplished by estimating shear. 
However, in the case of the microburst, it is the radial shear of the radial velocity that is 
typically measured. Human interpretation of microburst signatures in color-enhanced 
radial velocity displays is easily accomplished with trained observers50 and automatic 
detection has been implemented on the TDWR radar system. Radial velocity differ -
ences of 10 to 50 m/s are observed in microbursts. A radial velocity difference of more 
than 25 m/s over the length of a jet runway ( ≈3 km) is a serious concern.
One principal problem concerning microbursts is their short lifetimes, which are 
on the order of 15–20 minutes but the duration of peak intensity is only 1 or 2 min -
utes. Field research143 has clearly demonstrated that a few minutes advance warning 
using doppler radar can be achieved. Operational microburst detection radars use this 
automated detection algorithm with high performance ground clutter mitigation tech -
niques since the phenomenon occurs near the ground and oftentimes in very light or 
no precipitation.
C band is the preferred operational frequency for several reasons. First, a C-band 
antenna will have a smaller beamwidth than an S-band antenna of the same size 
and allow improved air flow measurements with strong clutter suppression near the 
airport surface. Second, since short range detection is important, radar attenuation 
effects are not a primary concern. Third, C band offers improved signal-to-clutter FIGURE   19. 7 Depiction of a microburst and its effect 
on an aircraft during takeoff. The loss of airspeed in the 
divergent wind field near to the ground is extremely haz -
ardous. A similar loss of airspeed near the ground occurs 
during landing. ( Courtesy of University Corporation for 
Atmospheric Research © 2007 , Boulder, CO )

performance since the large clutter targets are limited in radar cross section by Mie 
scattering, whereas the atmosphere-borne wind tracing scatterers are small and obey 
Rayleigh scattering cross section physics. X-band radars have been considered to 
some degree but the more severe attenuation that can occur in very heavy rain will 
limit performance unless the radar is located very near to the airport runways. In 
the mid-1990s the C-band Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) system was 
installed at 45 major airports to detect and warn aircraft of hazardous wind shear 
conditions, approaching gust fronts that may affect the airport approach and departure 
configuration, and microbursts.7 This network of radars along with much improved 
pilot training and awareness has all but eliminated aircraft accidents caused by micro -
bursts and strong wind shear.
Hail. The Nexrad radar makes use of a hail-detection algorithm that combines 
a high reflectivity factor with echo height and upper-level divergent radial velocity 
winds to detect the occurrence of hail. Polarimetric radar techniques improve quantita -
tive hail detection. Bringi et al.,15 Aydin et al.,144 and Illingworth et al.145 proposed a 
hail detection technique using differential reflectivity measurements. This technique 
depends upon the fact that for tumbling hail the differential reflectivity, the ratio of 
horizontal to vertical reflectivity, is near unity ( ≈0 dB). This differs sharply from 
heavy rain, where this ratio can be as large as 5 dB because large water droplets are 
horizontally oriented. The combination of absolute reflectivity factor and the dual 
polarization differential reflectivity gives unique signatures for hail and heavy rain, 
each of which is characterized by a high reflectivity factor. The difference in the differ -
ential reflectivity signatures is easily explained. Large raindrops assume flatter shapes 
(approximated by oblate spheroids) as they fall and thus scatter back the horizon -
tally polarized electric field more strongly than the vertically polarized electric field. 
Hailstones, having an irregular shape, physically tumble while they fall and, therefore, 
exhibit no preferred orientation on average. Thus, the horizontal and vertical scattered 
fields have nearly the same average value.
Wind Measurement . Lhermitte and Atlas146 were the first to show how a single 
doppler radar can be used to measure vertical profiles of the horizontal wind field when 
precipitation is present. This technique is most accurate if the wind field is uniform in 
the region scanned by the radar. The method depends upon an analysis of the radial 
velocity measured during a complete scan in azimuth with a single fixed elevation 
angle. At any slant range r, the height of the measurement is r sin a and the radius of 
the region scanned is r cos a, where a is the elevation angle as depicted in Figure 19.8. 
If b is the azimuth angle, Vh is the horizontal wind speed, and Vf is the fall speed of the 
particles, then the radial velocity at range r is given by
 Vr (b) = Vh cos b cos a + Vf sin a (19.60)
A harmonic analysis (least square fitting the amplitude, phase, and offset of a sinu -
soid) can be used to obtain Vh, the horizontal wind speed, the wind direction where cos 
b is maximum, and Vf, the mean particle fall speed all plotted as a function of height. 
This technique is referred to as the Velocity-Azimuth-Display (V AD). Browning and 
Wexler147 later showed how the V AD technique could be extended to measure other 
parameters of the wind field including wind-field divergence and wind-field deforma -
tion by employing an extended harmonic or Fourier series analysis. The V AD has been 
implemented on the Nexrad as a standard product that can be used in precipitation and

frequently in clear air. The V AD technique is most often applied to wind profiler radars 
that point vertically and step scan at relatively large elevation angles. An alternative 
determination of boundary layer wind fields using a single weather radar has found 
success using an echo tracking technique.148
Thunderstorm Prediction . Wilson and Schreiber149 illustrate how meteorologi -
cal doppler radar can be used to detect locations where new thunderstorm develop -
ment is likely to occur. Many weather radars have sufficient sensitivity to detect 
discontinuities of clear air echoes in the lower 2 to 4 km of the atmosphere out to 
50 or 100 km. This detection occurs principally in the summer months when the 
backscattering mechanism is caused by insects in the lower levels of the atmospheric 
boundary layer and sometimes may also be due to Bragg-scattered refractive index 
inhomogeneities. Wilson and Schreiber have found that about 90% of the thunder -
storms that occur in the Front Range of the Rockies in the summertime develop 
over such “boundaries” between two different air masses. Since these boundaries 
can be detected before any clouds are present and it is possible to infer the air mass 
convergence (or coming together of two air masses) where insects are forced to 
accumulate along these boundaries by doppler radar measurements, more precise 
prediction of thunderstorm occurrence is possible. From the radar designer’s stand -
point, such applications dictate the use of antennas with very low sidelobes (along 
with low-phase noise transmitters and receiver components) and signal processors 
having significant ground clutter rejection capability. The Nexrad radar system, with 
its high quality antenna and 50 dB of clutter rejection, is well suited to this important 
operational task.
Refractivity and Water Vapor Measurements.  Conventional weather radar pro -
cessing is generally designed to emphasize precipitation and wind-field measurements FIGURE   19. 8 Velocity-Azimuth-Display geometry for 
measuring horizontal wind with a single doppler radar.

scan (b) at elevation angle a permits an estimate of the 
vertical profile of horizontal winds. ( Courtesy of University

and to suppress ground clutter. However, it is known that radar beam bending caused 
by atmospheric refraction and the resulting anomalously propagated ground clutter 
echo gives an indication of the vertical profiles of temperature and moisture in the 
intervening lower atmosphere. Moreover, measuring the propagation speed of the 
radar pulse between normally propagated clutter targets (those directly viewed by 
the radar) gives an estimate of the refractive index of air along this propagation path. 
By measuring the absolute phase of the radar signal received from stationary ground 
clutter targets and comparing them with reference absolute phase measurements under 
known refractive conditions, one can measure the near surface propagation speeds 
of the radar pulse along these paths. Then, the refractive index, or refractivity, of the 
atmosphere of these atmospheric paths may be determined.17 Refractivity is a func -
tion of temperature, pressure, and moisture content. Consequently, if surface tem -
perature and pressure are independently available, as they frequently are, then the 
refractive index measurements may be converted to spatial fields of water vapor in the  
surface boundary layer. Such water vapor measurements are critical for obtaining 
accurate forecasts using numerical models and simulations of the atmosphere.150 This 
experimental measurement technique can be used to ranges of about 40 km where the 
Earth’s curvature prevents routine observation of ground clutter targets and is being 
considered for operational use in Nexrad.
19.6 RESEARCH APPLICATIONS
Operational meteorological radars are designed for reliability and simplicity of opera -
tion while providing the performance needed for operational applications. Research 
radars are considerably more complex, since cutting-edge research requires more 
detailed and more sensitive measurements of a multiplicity of variables simultane -
ously. In the research community, multiple-parameter (polarization and wavelength) 
radar studies, multiple doppler radar network studies, and a new generation of airborne 
and spaceborne radars are receiving considerable attention.
Dual Polarization/Wavelength Radar.  It is clear that polarimetric doppler 
radars provide a significant increase in the useful information that can be obtained 
from meteorological targets. The detection of hail and more accurate rainfall esti -
mates has primary significance. Dual polarization measurements at multiple wave -
lengths provide even more information related to the eventual interpretation of the 
size distributions, water-phase states, and hydrometeor (water or ice particles) types 
in different classes of precipitation and clouds. The capabilities of multiple-parameter 
meteorological radars are presented in Bringi and Hendry,14 Bringi and Chandra,24 and 
in the collection of papers edited by Hall.151 Whereas longer-wavelength radars are 
necessary for the study of severe storms, shorter wavelength millimeter-wave radars 
are useful for sensing and probing newly developing clouds. Researchers often need 
a wide range of these capabilities simultaneously. From the radar engineering stand -
point, the challenge is considerable, requiring radar designers to develop coherent 
waveform, polarization-diverse, and wavelength-diverse radars. As noted, there exist 
several polarimetric research radars and operational radars in the world.26
Multiple Radars.  A single doppler radar measures only a single radial compo -
nent of velocity. Lhermitte152 was among the first to describe how two or more doppler 
radars could be used, scanning together, to obtain the full three-dimensional air motion

fields in precipitation. This pioneering work led the way toward the use of networks 
of doppler radars for studies of individual clouds to examine the three-dimensional 
structure of vector air motion in precipitation. A point should be made here regarding 
the use of two doppler radars for measurements of three-dimensional winds. Since, 
in principle, two independent looks can measure only two components of vector air 
motion, the assumption of atmospheric mass continuity is invoked. This equation of 
mass continuity53( )∇ ⋅ =V0is used to obtain the third-dimensional component, where 
V is the vector air motion and is constrained to be zero at the surface. The vertical air 
motion is calculated from vertical integration of the mass continuity equation.
Figure 19.9 illustrates an air motion field obtained by two doppler radar observa -
tions in an individual convective storm cell. Shown are the horizontal vector fields in 
a plane approximately 100 m above the surface. The phenomenon being measured is 
a low-level divergent outflow (or microburst) just to right of the center. Figure 19.10 
shows another example of precipitation intensity and air motion fields superposed on 
a photograph of a convective thunderstorm cell. The data are taken from three doppler 
radars spaced about 40 km apart.
A developing network of short range doppler radars not range limited by the Earth’s 
curvature will provide more detailed observations close to the surface than the rela -
tively widely spaced WSR-88D network. The Collaborative, Adaptive Sensing of the 
Atmosphere (CASA) radar network will include many inexpensive, low power, scan -
ning, short wavelength radars mounted on towers of opportunity, primarily cell phone 
towers that blanket much of the U.S.153,154 Existing equipment on these towers will

provide a shared infrastructure for the CASA radars. This radar system will include 
intelligent decision making for scanning and tracking important low-level atmospheric 
features that are deemed critical for the aviation, weather forecasting, transportation, 
and local emergency response users. The CASA radars can communicate with each 
other for collaborative use of the data and adaptively change their operating param -
eters to best meet the prescribed needs at a given time. Depending on the final costs 
of deployment and operation, CASA networks may be developed only around critical 
areas such as urban areas, airports, etc.
Rapid Scan (Phased Array) Radar.  Doppler weather radars that use phased array 
antennas and complex waveform design may be applied to some of the more difficult 
radar meteorology observations. The use of multiple doppler radars has provided dra -
matic new information on the internal winds in large precipitating systems—information 
that can be obtained in no other way. Despite the power of this technique, the spatial 
resolution in the derived three-dimensional motion fields is generally not better than FIGURE   19. 10 Radar reflectivity contours and

of the order of 1 km. There are several reasons for this. The finite beamwidth limits the 
resolution available at longer ranges. At shorter ranges, the large solid angle that must 
be scanned in order to cover all regions of a storm requires total scanning times of the 
order of 3 to 5 min even for well-situated storms. This is a consequence of the on-target 
dwell time necessary for accurate measurements. Finally, the storm itself is evolving and 
moving during this measurement time, thus complicating the data registration in space 
and time.
Some operational and many research applications require faster scanning than 
conventional mechanically scanned radars can provide.155 These applications include 
longer lead times for tornado warnings, the study of finer scale storm features, interac -
tions between the internal motions and hydrometeor growth processes in the storms, 
and studies of electric charge separation in clouds. Brook and Krehbiel156 were among 
the first to discuss a very rapid-scanning radar (although nondoppler) for effectively 
obtaining snapshots of convective storms. Keeler and Frush157 discuss design consid -
erations for a more capable rapid-scanning doppler radar.
Any rapid-scanning approach generally must encompass two features: (1) the trans -
mit waveform must have a relatively large bandwidth to increase the number of inde -
pendent samples available in the desired spatial resolution cell; and (2) the antenna must 
be rapidly scanned throughout the desired atmospheric volume either mechanically or 
electronically. Mechanically scanned single frequency (standard) weather radars use a 
long dwell time to acquire an adequate number of independent samples to accurately 
estimate the spectral moment data used for meteorological measurements. A large 
bandwidth system (e.g., pulse compression radar) can acquire independent samples in 
range in a short dwell time that can be averaged, thus reducing the dwell time for each 
beam and reducing the total volume coverage scan time. Fast mechanical scanning  
(> 60 deg/sec) produces deleterious spectrum broadening effects157 that electronic step 
scanning easily avoids since the beam is fixed in space during the dwell time. A favored 
approach is to utilize a one-dimensional phased array that is electronically scanned in 
elevation while slowly rotating in azimuth.158 In this way, a full hemispheric volume 
can be covered in 1–2 minutes and smaller sector volumes may be covered in less than 
1 minute.159 Several military radars and aviation radars utilize electronically scanned 
beams but the expense of a fully capable system has prevented more than only a few 
meteorological radar systems from being designed and built.160,161 Rapid-scanning 
phased array radars have also been studied extensively in Europe.162
An alternative approach is to employ digital beamforming or frequency-steering  
techniques to transmit and simultaneously receive multiple beams using parallel 
receivers. Such military radars have been operated for several decades163 but none of 
these systems were ever designed or used for weather measurements. A mechanically 
scanned multiple beam weather radar system using simultaneous frequency scanned 
beams has been designed and constructed on a small truck. The Rapid Doppler on 
Wheels (Rapid-DOW) X-band radar, shown in Figure 19.11, uses six simultaneous 
frequency-steered beams separated by a few degrees emanating from a slotted wave -
guide phased array and independent receivers to acquire a volumetric coverage of 
convective storms in 1–3 minutes.164 Pulse compression is not used. The rapid data 
acquisition speed of this system has the potential to give new insights into thunder -
storm evolution, hurricanes at landfall, hail formation plus microburst, gust front and 
tornado genesis mechanisms that may likely evolve into an operational capability .
In the early 1990s, the FAA led an effort to develop dual-use weather and aircraft 
surveillance radar based on electronic scanning and pulse compression techniques,165

and an effort beginning a decade later continued the development of phased array 
radars for civil applications.166 Radars initially designed for military applications 
were modified for weather detection and successfully demonstrated the concept.167 In 
the early 2000s, a joint effort between the U.S. Navy, the National Weather Service, 
the National Severe Storms Laboratory, and the University of Oklahoma led to the 
development of the so-called National Weather Radar Testbed facility in Norman, 
Oklahoma, by combining a single panel SPY-1 phased array radar on a rotating pedes -
tal with a WSR-88D transmitter and custom receiver.168 Although this particular radar 
is not likely to be the preferred design for a future weather radar, the Oklahoma Phased 
Array Radar testbed can be used to explore electronic scanning strategies together with 
new pulsing and processing concepts that may lead to future development of a phased 
array weather radar system.
Airborne Radars.  Whereas commercial aviation weather radars are nose 
mounted X-band radars for severe weather and turbulence detection and avoidance, 
airborne research radars must have relatively more complex architectures169 in order to 
make more sensitive, high-resolution measurements. This powerful technique permits 
the use of a mobile platform, which therefore allows measurements over regions not 
accessible by ground-based systems. Moreover, the mobility of the aircraft permits 
longer term observations of rapidly moving but long-lived storms and cloud systems, 
thereby allowing more complete studies of evolution during various phases of the 
system.170
NCAR’s Eldora airborne doppler radar system,171 shown in Figure 19.12, consists 
of two slotted waveguide fixed-beam antennas mounted in the tail of the P-3 air -
craft, which is operated by the Naval Research Laboratory and covered by a rotating FIGURE   19. 11 Rapid-DOW (Doppler on Wheels) is a mobile X-band radar 
that uses six simultaneous beams to cover a volume of atmosphere in a much 
shorter volume coverage time than a mechanically scanned single beam radar. 
This rapid update scan is important for measuring violent convective storms, espe -
cially tornadoes as shown in photo. ( Photo courtesy of University Corporation

radome—a roto-dome. One beam points forward about 18 ° and the other aft by the 
same angle, thereby obtaining two radial components of common target volumes. With 
such a system, each antenna scans in a conical surface—one cone pointing forward, 
the other one rearward—thus permitting synthesis of a dual-doppler radar system 
along the aircraft track. The aircraft is flown alongside storms to synthesize dual-dop -
pler observations and, therefore, to obtain vector winds. Because the aircraft need not 
fly orthogonal tracks, the time required for measurements of cloud systems is dramati -
cally reduced as are the errors in these measurements. Moreover, severe storms (which 
could otherwise not be penetrated along an orthogonal track) and hurricanes (which 
can be penetrated by such aircraft) can be observed fully by an aircraft outside the 
regions of severe weather.
Various airborne radars exist in the research community for different applications 
and user groups. NASA has developed the dual wavelength (3 cm and 3 mm) EDOP 
radar for the high altitude ER-2 aircraft172 and a W-band 94-GHz airborne cloud radar 
for the DC-8 research aircraft.173 NOAA has operated two X-band radars similar to 
the ELDORA radar for hurricane tracking and research.174 JPL developed the ARMAR 
radar175 to test space radar concepts for the Tropical Rainfall Measurements Mission 
(TRMM). The University of Wyoming uses a 3-mm cloud radar mounted on a King 
Air aircraft.176 In the mid-2000s, NCAR acquired the High-performance Instrumented 
Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HAIPER, a Gulf Stream G-5 medium-
size jet aircraft) and designed a dual wavelength (8 and 3 mm) removable pod-mounted 
radar for cloud studies.177 The Canadian National Research Council has developed a 
similar airborne radar system.178
Spaceborne Radars.  Among the more significant challenges facing researchers 
today is the need to make global measurements of precipitation. Understanding global 
climate requires that quantitative measurements of precipitation be made throughout 
the world, particularly in the tropics and over the oceans. Satellite observations appear FIGURE   19. 12 Tail-mounted ELDORA doppler weather radar

to offer the only practical mechanism for obtaining these measurements. The TRMM 
satellite was launched in 1997 carrying the Ku-band single frequency Precipitation 
Radar (PR)179 and a 2.4 m single beam array antenna that is steered 17 ° on either side 
of the spacecraft track. Its relatively low inclination orbit at 350 km altitude provides 
tropical precipitation measurements with 250 m range resolution and a 4.5 km foot -
print over a 250 km swath. A TRMM follow-on program, the Global Precipitation 
Measurement (GPM) program, envisions extending precipitation coverage to the 
mid-latitude (65 ° N and S latitude) flying in a 250 km altitude orbit and using dual 
wavelength precipitation radar (DPR)180 at Ku and Ka bands for more accurate rainfall 
estimates using attenuation techniques.181,182 The two radars will have matched beams 
from two slotted waveguide array antennas and provide coverage under the spacecraft 
track similar to TRMM.
CloudSat is a satellite launched in 2006 flying a W band (3 mm) cloud profiling 
radar (CPR) orbiting the Earth in a sun synchronous orbit at an altitude of about  
700 km.183 The transmitter is an Extended Interaction Klystron (EIK) high-power 
amplifier generating a 3.3 msec monochromatic pulse having peak power of 1.7 kW. 
The antenna is a 1.85 m diameter reflector offset fed by a quasi-optical transmission 
line and produces a 0.12 ° beam with extremely low sidelobes. These radar design 
parameters allow an exceptional sensitivity of –26 dBZ at the Earth surface. CloudSat 
orbits in formation with four other satellites as part of the so-called A-train constel -
lation of satellites that provide combined radar, lidar, and radiometric measurements 
for Earth studies. The CPR on-board CloudSat has 500 m vertical resolution with a 
1.4 km footprint and is similar to the NASA Airborne Cloud Radar that has flown for 
several years on board the NASA DC-8 aircraft173. Combining these high-resolution 
cloud measurements with high sensitivity is one of the technical goals for acquiring 
new information regarding cloud effect on the Earth’s climate.
Clear-Air Wind Profiling Radars.  Another form of doppler radar that has 
become widely used, especially in the research community, is the so-called wind pro -
filing radar,10 or “wind profiler.” Wind profilers usually take the form of VHF and 
UHF multiple fixed-beam systems, pointing vertically and at angles approximately 
15° from the zenith to infer profiles of the horizontal wind averaged over the area of 
measurement. Such radars can make doppler measurements throughout the range of 
altitudes from a few hundred meters to 20 km or more above the surface, depending 
upon the wavelength selected and the power-aperture product available. These radars 
have the ability to measure high resolution winds continuously, which permits the 
observation of smaller scale temporal and spatial wind-field features that cannot be 
obtained from the global 12-hour rawinsonde (balloon launch) network. These smaller 
scale measurements are important for understanding local and regional weather and 
for effective forecasting on these scales.
Very powerful radars of this type are referred to as Mesosphere, Stratosphere, 
Troposphere (MST) radars because of their ability to make measurements throughout 
most of these atmospheric regions up to 60–100 km in altitude. Several major MST 
radar facilities located at facilities around the world operate at VHF frequencies around 
50 MHz and observe upper atmospheric (tropospheric and lower stratospheric) winds 
or the higher level stratospheric and mesospheric winds. Shorter wavelength UHF wind 
profilers operating at 400–450 MHz sense atmospheric winds up to 20–25 km and these 
“tropospheric wind profilers” are the most widely used for operational weather obser -
vations. UHF wind profilers operating at 915 MHz in the U.S. and 1200–1300 MHz

in Europe cover the lower atmospheric winds up to 3–5 km (or a few km higher with 
larger antennas) where the strong moisture fluctuations present in the atmospheric 
boundary layer provide strong scattering signatures at these shorter wavelengths. 
These UHF boundary-layer wind profilers are typically used for air pollution moni -
toring and warnings as well as various research applications.
These clear-air radars receive energy backscattered from refractive index inho -
mogeneities caused by naturally occurring atmospheric turbulence.184 The antenna 
systems usually take the form of phased arrays that form beams several degrees 
wide that are switched to 3, 4, or 5 nearly vertical beams for 1–2 minutes each and 
measure vertical profiles of wind every 5–30 minutes. The antennas are frequently 
of the coaxial collinear (co-co) style for those radars and Yagi array elements for 
those at the higher frequencies. The higher frequency UHF profilers typically use 
either Yagi or microstrip patch array antennas. Transmitters are generally in the 
form of high-powered, coherent transmitting tubes or solid-state amplifiers. At the 
University of Kyoto, Japan, the antenna-transmitter system consists of 475 crossed 
Yagi radiating elements, each with its own solid-state transmitter.185 This approach 
allows for very flexible electronic scanning of the beam. NOAA operates a net -
work of over thirty 404 and 449 MHz wind profilers in the central United States 
using solid-state transmitters that supply continuous wind profiles up to 20 km for 
improved weather forecasts and current upper air wind information for aviation 
applications.186
It is important to recognize that three-beam doppler systems can accurately 
measure horizontal winds in all three velocity components if the wind is uniform. 
Four- and five-beam systems allow one to determine the quality of the measure -
ments by detecting the presence of a nonuniform wind flow. Carbone, Strauch, and 
Heymsfield187 and Strauch et al.188 address the issue of wind measurement error 
in detail. The reader is referred to the review paper by Röttger and Larsen10 for a 
thorough treatment of wind-profiler technology and to the sequence of Tropospheric 
Profiling Symposia for tropospheric profiling applications of winds and other mete -
orological parameters.189
Spaced Antenna Techniques.   An additional advantage of these long wavelength 
radars is their ability to measure not only the radial vertical wind components directly, 
but also the mean horizontal wind that is transverse to the vertical beam without 
scanning that beam off zenith. These profilers use the so-called spaced antenna tech -
niques with multiple receivers to process the amplitude and phase differences of 
the echo structures as they translate over two adjacent antennas (usually subarrays 
of the same array antenna) to measure components of the horizontal or transverse 
wind.190 In this manner, two orthogonal subarrays can measure components of the 
horizontal wind using cross-spectral or correlation processing techniques.191 Since 
the measurement is made in pairs of overlapping beams directly above the radar, it is 
no longer necessary to assume or require horizontal homogeneity of the wind field in 
the larger area above the radar and/or the long integration times necessary to assure 
this homogeneity. These spaced antenna techniques are most frequently used when 
high spatial and temporal resolution measurements are required such as estimating 
detailed boundary layer turbulence fields. Zhang and Doviak have investigated using 
the dual beam–spaced antenna technique implemented with an electronically scanned 
phased array radar to estimate the transverse, as well as the radial, wind components 
at arbitrary scan angles.192
