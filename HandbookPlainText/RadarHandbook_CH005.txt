Carlo Kopp Monash University 5.1 INTRODUCTION In spite of more than a half century of improvements in radar performance and  reliability, the effort required for deployment, operation, and maintenance of most  radars is substantial. Furthermore, the power-aperture product is never as large as  desired. The forward projected area as well as avionics weight is very costly in most  fighter aircraft parameters. 
These parameters have motivated users, buyers, and  designers to want more functions in a single radar and its complementary processing  suite. As a result, most modern fighter radars are multifunctional—providing radar,  navigation, landing aids, data link, and Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) func - tions.1,2 The primary enabler for multifunctional radar is software-defined signal  and data processing, first introduced in the mid 1970s.3–6 Software programmability  allows many radar system modes to be performed using the same RF hardware. In  addition, modern navigation aids work so well that each radar mode is defined by  its earth situation-geometry with almost all waveform parameters set by local earth  conditions.7,9 The modern radar often is net-centric, using and providing data to a  communications network and where suitably equipped, has its own Internet protocol  (IP) address. 
Multifunctionality is not dependent on antenna type. In fact, the mechanically  scanned AN/APG-65, 70, and 73 radars have demonstrated multifunctionality in  combat.7 However, multifunctionality is facilitated by Active Electronically Scanned  Antenna (AESA) arrays. The multifunctional AESA radar in the F/A-18E/F fighter is  shown with a protective cover over the array in Figure 5.1. 
The AESA is shaped and  canted upward to aid in some modes and to minimize reflections to enemy radars.8Chapter 5 ch05.indd   1 12/17/07   1:26:20 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

5.2 RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 This chapter addresses what  signals are emitted and why they are needed in a  Multifunctional Fighter Aircraft Radar (MFAR). The why begins with typical mis - sions, which shows the geometry that gives rise to each radar mode and waveform,  lists representative radar modes, and shows typical modern airborne radar mode inter - leaving and timing. The answer to what  is provided by typical waveform variations  and a few examples. 
The examples are not from any single radar but are a composite  of modern radars. The general MFAR idea is illustrated in Figure 5.2. It shows time  multiplexed operations for air-to-air (A-A), air-to-surface (A-S), electronic warfare  (EW), and communication from the same radio frequency (RF) hardware and process - ing complex often over most of the microwave band.9,11 Sometimes, multiple functions  can be performed simultaneously if a common waveform is used. 
The antenna aperture usually has multiple phase centers enabling measurement for  Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP),13 Displaced Phase Center Antenna (DPCA) FIGURE 5.1  AN/APG-79 Multifunctional AESA Radar ( Courtesy Raytheon  Company 12 ) FIGURE 5.2  MFAR interleaves A-S, A-A, and EW functions ( adapted 9 ) ch05.indd   2 12/17/07   1:26:22 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.36x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 processing, conventional monopulse angle tracking, jammer nulling, and out-of-band  angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation. The optimum placement of phase centers is an  important design tradeoff. A phase center is an antenna aperture channel, which is off - set in space and provides a partially or fully independent measurement of an incoming  electromagnetic wavefront. 
For example, a one-dimensional phase monopulse has two  phase centers, a two-dimensional phase monopulse has four phase centers, DPCA has  two or more phase centers, a radar with a guard horn for sidelobe suppression has two  phase centers, and an adaptive array may have many phase centers.13–16 STAP is an  extension of the classic theory for a matched filter in the presence of non–white noise,  which includes both time and space. Overall weapon system requirements usually favor X or Ku band for the operating  frequency of a MFAR. In addition, the MFAR apertures and associated transmitter are  usually the largest on an aircraft and hence, can create the highest Effective Radiated  Power (ERP) for jamming adversary radars and data links, where these are in-band. 
Multifunctional Radar Architecture.  An example MFAR block diagram is  shown in Figure 5.3. The modern integrated avionic suite concept blurs the boundaries  between traditional radar functions and other sensors, countermeasures, weapons, and  communications (see Figures 5.12 and 5.14 later in the chapter). 
There is a microwave  and RF suite; an electro-optical, infrared, ultraviolet (EO) suite; a stores management  suite; a controls and displays suite; a multiply-redundant vehicle management suite,  and a multiply-redundant processor complex. Each microwave and/or RF aperture may have some embedded signal conditioning  but then may be multiplexed to standardized common design RF, filter, frequency ref - erence, analog to digital conversion (A/D), input-output (I/O), and control modules. A  similar design concept is used for the electro-optical (EO) sensors, stores management,  FIGURE 5.3  MFAR merged with other sensors ( adapted2) ch05.indd   3 12/17/07   1:26:30 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

There  is substantial data traffic between the core processing and the sensors to provide point - ing, cueing, tracking, and multisensor fusion of detections. The aim of this approach is  to provide a shared pool of computational resources, which may be flexibly allocated  between sensors and functions. The sensors may contain dedicated motion sensing, but long-term navigation is pro - vided by the vehicle management global positioning system and inertial navigation sys - tem (GPS/INS). 
The on-radar motion sensing must sense position to a fraction of the  transmitted wavelength over the coherent processing interval. This is usually done with  inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyros with very high sampling rates. An  inertial navigation system estimates the position of the aircraft in a worldwide coordinate  space by integrating the outputs of the gyros and accelerometers, typically using Kalman  filtering techniques. 
Accumulated errors in such a system can be corrected by using GPS  updates as well as known reference points measured with the radar, or EO sensors. There may be dozens or hundreds of stored program devices distributed throughout  the avionics. These lower level functional suites are connected by standardized bus - ses, which may be fiber optic or wired. 
The programmable devices are controlled by  software operating environments invoking programs. The architecture objective is to  have standard interfaces, few unique assemblies, and single-level maintenance. The suite of microwave and RF apertures in a fighter aircraft might appear as  shown in Figure 5.4. 
As many as 20 apertures may be distributed throughout the vehi - cle, performing radar, data link, navigation, missile warning, direction finding, jam - ming, or other functions over a frequency range covering several decades.2 There are  apertures distributed over the aircraft that point forward and aft, right and left, as well  as up and down. Some apertures will be shared for communications, radio navigation,  and identification (CNI) as well as identification, friend or foe (IFF) due to compatible  frequencies and geometries. Data links such as JTIDS/Link 16 and Link 22 can share  apertures with GPS and L band satellite communications (L SATCOM). 
EW apertures  must be broadband by nature and can be shared with radar warning receivers (RWR),  radar auxiliaries, and some types of CNIs.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.56x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 The apertures are signal conditioned, controlled, and interfaced through busses in the  aircraft with remaining processing performed either in a common processor complex,  as shown in Figure 5.5, or in federated processors distributed throughout the aircraft. 
 One important class of standardized modules contains basic timing and programmable  event generators (PEG) that create accurate timing for Pulse Repetition Frequencies  (PRFs), analog to digital conversion (A/D) sampling, pulse and chip widths, blank - ing gates, beam repointing commands, and other synchronized real-time interrupts. A  second class contains RF and intermediate frequency (IF) amplification and mixing.  A third class contains low noise frequency synthesizers, which may include Direct  Digital-frequency Synthesis (DDS). 
A/D converters and control interface modules are  the final class. Bussing protocols and speeds must have adequate reserves to insure  fail-safe real-time operation. The functional block diagram and operation of a specific sensor mode is then over - laid on this hardware and software infrastructure. 
A specific mode is implemented in an  applications program in the same sense that word-processing is on a personal computer  (PC). Carrying the analogy further, common experience with the unreliability of PC  hardware and software requires that a system of the type depicted in Figure 5.3 must  be redundant, error checking, trusted, fail safe in the presence of faults, and embody  strict program execution security. This is a very challenging system engineering task. 
 Exhaustive mathematical assurance and system testing is required, which is completely  different from current commercial personal computer practice. A notional MFAR integrated core processing complex with its corresponding inter - faces similar to that shown in Figure 5.3 is shown in Figure 5.5, where there are  multiple redundant processing arrays that contain standardized modules connected in  a non-blocking switched network. Internal and external busses connect the individual  processing arrays to each other as well as to the other suites, sensors, controls, and  displays. 
Usually, there are both parallel electrical signal busses as well as serial fiber  optic busses depending on speed and total length in the aircraft.2 The signal and data   processor complex contains multiple processor and memory entities, which might be FIGURE 5.5  MFAR processing ( adapted 2 ) ch05.indd   5 12/17/07   1:26:32 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

5.6 RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 on a single chip or on separate chips depending on yield, complexity, speed, cache  size, and so on. Each processor array may consist of programmable signal processors  (PSP), general purpose processors (GPP), bulk memory (BM), input-output (I/O), and  a master control unit (MCU). The PSPs perform signal processing on arrays of sensor  data. 
The GPPs perform processing in which there are large numbers of conditional  branches. The MCU issues programs to PSPs, GPPs, and BM, as well as manages  overall execution and control. Typical processing speed is 6000 MIPS (millions of  instructions per second) per chip but might be 32 GIPS (billions of instructions per  second) in the near future.17 Clock frequencies are limited by on-chip signal propaga - tion but are up to 4 GHz (gigahertz) and could be 10 GHz in the near future.18 Sensor  processing has arrived at the point where the conception of successful algorithms is  more important than the computational horsepower necessary to carry them out. 
MFAR Software Structure . Improper operation of many fighter systems  can be hazardous. As previously mentioned, the software must be exhaustively  tested, error checked, mathematically trusted, failsafe in the presence of faults,  and embody strict program execution security. 
One of the most important aspects  is rigid adherence to a structured program architecture. An object-based hierarchi - cal structure, where each level is subordinate to the level above and subprograms  are called in strict sequence, is necessary. It also requires, among other things,  that subprograms never call themselves (recursive code) or any others at their  execution level. 
Subprograms (objects) are called, receive execution parameters  from the level above (the parent), and return results back to the calling level.94 An  example of such a software structure is shown in Figures 5.6 and 5.7. The software  would be executed in the hardware shown in Figure 5.5. FIGURE 5.6  MFAR structured software ch05.indd   6 12/17/07   1:26:38 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.76x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 An MFAR can support many activities (or modes) concurrently by interleaving  their respective data collections. 
Surveillance, track updates, and ground maps are  examples of such activities. The software needed to support each activity is mapped to  a specific client module, as shown in Figure 5.7. Each client module is responsible for  maintaining its own object database and for requesting use of the aperture. 
Requests  are made by submitting antenna job requests that specify both the waveform to be used  (how to do it) and the priority and urgency of the request. A scheduler executes during each data collection interval and decides what to do  next, based on the priorities and urgencies of the antenna job requests that have been  received. This keeps the aperture busy and responsive to the latest activity requests. 
 Following the selection of the antenna job by the scheduler, the front-end (transmit and  receive) hardware is configured, and in-phase and quadriture (I/Q) data is collected and  sent to the signal processors. There, the data is processed in a manner defined by the  sensor mode, and the signal processing results are returned to the client that requested  them. This typically results in database updates and/or new antenna job requests from  the client. 
New activities can be added at any time using this modular approach. Although this structure is complex and the software encompasses millions of lines  of code, modern MFAR software integrity can be maintained with strict control of  interfaces, formal configuration management processes, and formal verification and  validation software tools. In addition, most subprograms are driven by read-only  tables, as shown in Figure 5.7, so that the evolution of aircraft tactics, capabilities, and  hardware do not require rewrites of validated subprograms. 
Software versions (builds)  are updated every year throughout the lifetime of the system, which may be decades.  Each subprogram must have table driven error checking as well. Many lower levels are  not shown in Figures 5.6 and 5.7; there may be several thousand subprograms in all. 
Range Doppler Situation.  Modern radars have the luxury of interleaving most  of the modes suggested in Figure 5.2 in real time and selecting the best available time  or aircraft position to invoke each mode as the mission requires.7,9 The geometry that must be solved each time is shown in Figure 5.8. The fighter  aircraft pulse doppler geometry is centered around the aircraft traveling at a velocity,  Va, and at an altitude, h, above the Earth’s surface. 
The radar pulse repetition frequency FIGURE 5.7  MFAR priority scheduling ch05.indd   7 12/17/07   1:26:39 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

5.8 RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 (PRF) gives rise to a series of range (1, 2, 3, 4) and doppler ( x, y, z) ambiguities, as  shown in Figure 5.8, which intercept the Earth’s surface as range “rings” and iso-   doppler “hyperbolas” (because the Earth is a rough geoid, constant range and doppler  contours are not actually rings or hyperbolas). The radar antenna pattern intercepts the  limb of the Earth usually in both the main beam and sidelobes. A target in the main  beam at range, Rt, and velocity, Vt, may have to be observed in the presence of both  range and doppler ambiguities. 
Only the target’s line-of-sight velocity, Vtlos, is observ - able on a short term basis. The radar designers’ problem is to select the best waveform  in this target-clutter geometry. Historically, these waveforms were selected ahead of  time and built into the radar hardware and software. 
Most modern airborne radars  solve this geometry in real time and continuously select the best available frequency,  PRF, pulsewidth, transmit power, scan pattern, etc. Unfortunately, the specifics of the waveform are unpredictable even to the radar  without exact knowledge of the aircraft-target-earth velocity-geometry set and mode  of operation requested by the operator or mission software. This makes testing quite  difficult; fortunately, test equipment has come a long way. 
Hardware-in-the-loop test - ing using real-time simulation of the entire geometry and external world in the radar  integration laboratory is commonly employed. Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA).  Although multifunctional radars  have been deployed with mechanically scanned and electronically scanned antennas,  fully multifunctional radars use Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA), which  contain a transmit-receive channel (T/R) for each radiator.1 The advantages of AESA  are fast adaptive beam shaping and agility, improved power efficiency, improved  mode interleaving, simultaneous multiple weapon support, and reduced observabil - ity.19–23 Perhaps half the cost and complexity of an AESA is in the T/R channels. 
That  said, however, the feed network, beam steering controller (BSC), AESA power supply,  and cooling subsystem (air or liquid) are equally important.9,11FIGURE 5.8  Strike fighter pulse doppler geometry7,9 ch05.indd   8 12/17/07   1:26:40 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.96x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 A major enabler for AESAs is the state of the art in microwave integrated circuits.1  This has followed the dramatic cost and performance gains available in most semicon - ductor technologies. Each T/R channel has self-diagnosis features, which can detect  failure and communicate that to the beam steering controller for failure compensation.  AESAs can accommodate up to 10% failures with very little degradation if properly  compensated in the BSC.24 From an MFAR point of view, the important parameters are volumetric densities  high enough to support less than 1/2 wavelength spacing; radiated power densities high  enough to support 4 watts per sq. 
cm.; radiated-to-prime-power efficiencies greater  than 25%; bandwidth of several GHz on transmit and almost twice that bandwidth on  receive; phase and amplitude calibration and control adequate to provide at least –50 dB  rms sidelobes; amplitude control adequate to provide 50 dB power management; noise  performance adequate to support the subclutter visibility requirements; and finally, suf - ficient storage and computing to allow beam repointing/adjustment in a fraction of  1 msec. Fast beam adjustment requires high-speed busses to each T/R channel. One of the principal advantages of an AESA is the ability to manage both power  and spatial coverage on a short-term basis (10s of msec.). 
Often another advantage is  that both the noise figure is lower and radiated power is higher for a given amount of  prime power. This is because the RF path lengths can be much shorter, which usually  leads to lower front-end losses. Each radiating element is usually designed to be very  broadband and is driven by a T/R channel in a typical AESA array. 
There are typi - cally a few thousand channels in an MFAR AESA. Each channel contains first-level  power regulation, filtering, logic, calibration tables as well as the obvious RF func - tions. Some channels in the array are dedicated to other functions such as calibration,  jammer nulling, sidelobe blanking, close in missile datalink, out-of-band direction  finding, etc.19,25,26, 27 Also, there are usually some channels at the edge of the array that  are passive and improve the sidelobes and RCS pattern.8 Figure 5.9 shows the comparison between a conventional mechanically scanned  radar with the low-noise amplifier and a high-power traveling wave tube transmit - ter mounted off the gimbal versus a real-time adapted AESA with two different scan  regimes for the same amount of input prime power. 
AESA performance falls off for  large scan coverage because of the lower projected aperture area for a fixed mounting as  shown in Figure 5.1. A mechanical scan has the same projected area in all directions and  large scan angles marginally reduce radome losses, which results in slightly improved  large angle performance. Nonetheless, AESA performance is usually superior inside  FIGURE 5.9  Example AESA management comparison ( adapted 9 ) ch05.indd   9 12/17/07   1:26:41 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.10  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 a ±50° azimuth scan.9,11,28 Usually, a fighter can’t engage at long range outside this  azimuth for kinematic reasons. 
The performance differences depicted in Figure 5.9 are the result of three factors:  the installed aperture can be 20% larger in net projected area at the aircraft in-flight  horizontal due to elimination of gimbal swing space, 2:1 higher radiated power due to  lower losses and better efficiency, and 60% lower losses before the low-noise ampli - fier. The other major advantage is that search volume can be changed dynamically to  fit the instant tactical situation, as suggested in Figure 5.9.28 The feed network is mundane but critically important. In single tube transmit - ters, the feed is heavy because it must carry high power at low loss. 
AESA feeds use  smaller coax, stripline, microstrip, or RF modulated light in fiber optics for transmit  and receive RF, since less than 10 watts RF or optical is usually required. However,  significant DC power is still required for RF feed distribution amplifiers because thou - sands must be driven. Cost, weight, and complexity is still an issue because multiple  phase centers necessary for adaptive array performance require multiple manifolds. 
 Usually, once a subarray is formed in the manifolds, it is digitized and multiplexed for  adaptive signal processing. Another important function is beam steering control (BSC). The BSC does array  calibration, failed element compensation,8,24 phase and amplitude setting for beam  steering as well as space-time adaptive operation.29–33 The BSC is usually realized  with a combination of general purpose processing of the type found in a personal  computer with very high speed incremental phase and amplitude calculation and T/R  module interface hardware. 
Both scanning and adaptive operation require very low  latency (i.e., the time between the sensed need and the first pulse at the target is usually  1 msec) beam control in a high-speed aircraft platform. Lastly, the AESA requires a very significant power supply.1 Power supplies have  a history of being heavy, hot, and unreliable. Even the best systems still have overall  power efficiencies (prime power in to RF out in space) in the 10–25% region in spite  of years of development. 
The typical AESA requires low voltage and high current  at the T/R channel. This forces large conductors in the absence of high power light - weight superconductors (not available at this writing). It also requires very low voltage  drop rectifiers and regulators. 
Cooling is generally a significant performance burden.  Usually, the power supplies are distributed to improve reliability and fault tolerance.  Often, power converters are operated at switching frequencies up to several hundred  megahertz to reduce the size of magnetics and filter components, and sometimes, the  switching frequencies are synchronized to the radar master clock. 
5.2 TYPICAL MISSIONS AND MODES Air-to-Surface Mission Profile . The mode structure of any modern fighter air - craft arises from mission profiles.7,9 One typical mission profile for an air-to-surface  (A-S) strike is shown in Figure 5.10. The mission profile begins with a takeoff, con - tinues through flight to a target, and ultimately returns to the starting point. 
Along the  way, the aircraft uses a variety of modes to navigate, search and acquire targets, track  targets, deliver weapons, assess battle damage, engage in countermeasures, and moni - tor and calibrate its performance. AESAs have demonstrated simultaneous multiple  weapon deliveries.22 ch05.indd   10 12/17/07   1:26:41 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.116x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 Air-to-Surface Mode Suite.  The mission naturally creates the need for an air- to-surface mode suite7,9 for fighter radar, as shown in Figure 5.11. 
Each general cat - egory of operation contains modes primarily for that function, but modes will often  be invoked during other parts of the mission. Within each mode shown in Figure 5.11,  there is optimization for the particular combination of altitude, range to the target,  antenna footprint on the Earth’s surface, relative target and clutter doppler, dwell time  available, predicted target statistical behavior, transmitted frequency, and desired reso - lution. Obviously, each mode must not compromise some required level of mission  stealth.34–37 A modern fighter is net-centric and exchanges substantial information with  other systems. 
Both the fighter’s wingman, support aircraft, and surface nodes may  exchange complete data and tasking in real time to facilitate a mission. The fighter  and its wingman will coordinate mode tasking so that during a high resolution ground  map, which could take a minute to form, the wingman might be performing an air-to- air search and track to protect both of them.FIGURE 5.10  Typical air-to-surface mission profile7,9 FIGURE 5.11  Fighter aircraft air-to-surface radar mode suite7,9 ch05.indd   11 12/17/07   1:26:43 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.12  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 Some modes are used for several operational categories, such as real beam map  (RBM), fixed target track (FTT), doppler beam sharpening (DBS), and synthetic aper - ture radar (SAR), used not only for navigation but also for acquisition and weapon  delivery to fixed targets.38–43 SAR may also be used to detect targets in earthworks or  trenches covered with canvas and a small amount of dirt, which are invisible to EO  or IR sensors. Similarly, air-to-surface ranging (A-S Range) and precision velocity  update (PVU) may be used for weapon support to improve delivery accuracy as well  as navigation.7,9 Terrain following and terrain avoidance (TF/TA) is used for navigation at very  low altitudes or in mountainous terrain. 
Sea surface search (SSS), sea surface track  (SST), and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), which will be described later in  the chapter, are used primarily for the acquisition and recognition of ship targets.  Ground moving target indication (GMTI) and ground moving target tracking (GMTT)  are used primarily for the acquisition and recognition of surface vehicle targets but  also for recognizing large movements of soldiers and materials in a battle-space. High  power jamming (HiPwrJam) is a countermeasure available from AESAs due to their  natural broadband, beam agile, high gain, and high power attributes. 
AESAs also allow  long range air-to-surface data links (A-S Data Link) through the radar primarily for  map imagery. Because there may be thousands of wavelengths and a gain of millions  through a radar, automatic gain control and calibration (AGC/CAL) is usually required  fairly often. Modes optimized for this function are invoked throughout a mission. 
Waveform Variations by Mode.  Although the specific waveform is hard to pre - dict, typical waveform variations can be tabulated based on observed behavior of a  number of existing A-S radar systems. Table 5.1 shows the range of parameters that  can be observed as a function of radar mode. 
The parameter ranges listed are PRF,  pulse width, duty cycle, pulse compression ratio, independent frequency looks, pulses  per coherent processing interval (CPI), transmitted bandwidth, and total pulses in a  Time-On-Target ( TOT). Obviously, most radars do not contain all of this variation, but modes exist in many  fighter aircraft, which represent a good fraction of the parameter range. Most fighter  radars are frequency agile since they will be operated in close proximity to similar or  identical systems. 
The frequency usually changes in a carefully controlled, completely  coherent manner during a CPI.8 This can be a weakness for certain kinds of jamming  since the phase and frequency of the next pulse is predictable. Sometimes to counter - act this weakness, the frequency sequence is pseudorandom from a predetermined set  with known autocorrelation properties, for example, Frank, Costas, Viterbi, P codes.16  A major difficulty with complex wideband frequency coding is that the phase shift - ers in a phase scanned array must be changed on an intra- or inter-pulse basis greatly  complicating beam steering control and absolute T/R channel phase delay. Another  challenge is minimizing power supply phase pulling when PRFs and pulsewidths vary  over more than 100:1 range. 
MFAR systems not only have a wide variation in PRF  and pulsewidth but also usually exhibit large instant and total bandwidth. Coupled  with the large bandwidth is the requirement for long coherent integration times. This  requirement naturally leads to extreme stability master oscillators and ultra low-noise  synthesizers.44 Air-to-Air Mission Profile. 
 Just as with an air-to-surface mission, the mode  structure of a modern fighter aircraft air-to-air mission arises from its profile.45 A typi - cal mission profile for air-to-air (A-A) is shown in Figure 5.12.

Air-to-Air Mode Suite.  Similarly, the A-A mission naturally creates the need for  a corresponding mode suite for the radar, as shown in Figure 5.13.46,47 At the radar sen - sor and air-to-air mode software level, there is adaptive task prioritization to insure that  the highest processor prioritized, pilot-selected threat is serviced first. Passive modes  are interleaved with active operation to improve survivability and passive tracking and  ID. 
Each mode shown in Figure 5.13 is optimized in real time for the particular combi - nation of altitude, range to the target, density of target threats, antenna footprint on the  Earth’s surface, relative target and clutter doppler, dwell time available, predicted target  statistical behavior, transmitted frequency, and desired resolution.9,11 The mode category “autonomous and cued search” contains the modes most com - monly associated with fighter radars. There are usually two range-gated high pulse rep - etition frequency (HPRF) modes: velocity search (VS) primarily dedicated to longest  range detection and range while search (RWS), which uses some form of FM ranging  to estimate target range. There is a medium PRF (MPRF) mode, which provides all  aspect velocity-range search (VRS) at the expense of poorer long-range performance. 
 In addition, there are two passive modes: passive search and ranging, in which the  radar detects and estimates range and angle to an emitter or bistatically (wingman or  support aircraft) illuminated target and ESM shared aperture in which the RF and pro - cessor complex detects, estimates waveform parameters, and records them for future  use. Passive search may be combined with cued burst ranging to better estimate emit - ter location. Extended volume search is a mode used with cueing from another on- or  off-board sensor in what normally would be an unfavorable geometry.85 Many modes and functions are shared in common with A-S, especially countermea - sures and performance monitoring. 
Extremely important in both modes is implementa - tion of emissions control to minimize the ability of the adversary to detect, track, and  attack using the radar emission.16 Without care, these emissions can easily serve as a  strong guidance signal for a hostile antiradiation missile (ARM).50,51 Antenna apertures  that have multiple independent phase centers can perform both adaptive clutter cancel - lation as well as jammer cancellation with suitable hardware and software.14,27,29–33 FIGURE 5.13  A-A mode suite9 ch05.indd   14 12/17/07   1:26:45 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.156x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 The subsuite of multi-target track (MTT) contains conventional track while scan  (TWS), passive tracking of emitters or echoes from bistatic illumination, missile track - ing with or without a missile datalink or beacon, and several modes to recognize  target number and type: raid assessment and noncooperative target recognition (usu - ally incorrectly called target identification ). The fighter and wingman will coordinate  modes through the net so that both have situational awareness during the long time  span required to provide target recognition. Another important fighter category is weapon support. 
Missile update is the mea - surement of missile and target position, velocity and acceleration to allow statistically  independent measurements for transfer alignment, as well as missile state-of-health.  Missile update provides the latest target information and future dynamics prediction  by data link. IR missile slaving co-aligns radar and seeker. 
Since gun effective ranges  are very short, gun ranging causes the radar to sense the gun field of fire, predicts  angle rate, and measures range to a target for tentative gunfire.9 It may also track gun  rounds during fire. There are thousands of electrical degrees of phase between free space and the A/D  converters. The combination of temperature, time, and manufacturing tolerances gives  rise to the need for self calibration, test, fault detection, failure diagnosis, and needed  corrections, which are performed by a subsuite of performance monitor software. 
Timing Structure.  The significance of the remaining parameters in Tables 5.1  and 5.2 can best be illustrated with a timing structure typical of fighter radars.7,8,9   Figure 5.14 shows a modern radar timing structure in a sequence of progressively  expanded timelines. The first row of Figure 5.14 shows a typical scan cycle covering  the required volume of interest for a specific mode. 
The time span for a full scan cycle  might be 1 to 5 seconds. Inside the total scan cycle time, there may be several bars of  a scanned region of space with a time span of a few tenths of a second. A bar is a scan  segment along a single angular trajectory, as shown in Figure 5.20, later in the chapter.

5.16  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 Each bar consists of multiple beam positions of a few tens of milliseconds each, which  are computed on the fly to optimally cover the selected volume. Each beam cycle, in turn,  may contain one or more radar modes or submodes, such as those contained in Tables 5.1  or 5.2 and depicted in the lowest line of Figure 5.6. The modes may not be invoked each  time depending on the geometry between the aircraft and the intended target set. 
The mode time is broken up into coherent processing intervals (CPI’s). A coher - ent processing interval is segmented, as shown in the bottom row of Figure 5.14. The  particular example shown is tracking that might be used in FTT, GMTT, PVU, or A-G  Ranging, as shown previously in Figure 5.10, and later in Figures 5.32 and 5.38. 
It  consists of a frequency change; settling time; passive receiving to be sure the band isn’t  jammed; calibrate that doesn’t intentionally radiate but often there is some RF leakage  radiated; an automatic gain control (AGC) interval in which a number of pulses are  transmitted to set the receiver gain; and finally two intervals in which range, doppler, and  angle discriminants are formed. These CPIs often but not always have constant power,  frequency sequence, PRF sequence, pulsewidth, pulse compression, and bandwidth.7,8,9 5.3 A-A MODE DESCRIPTIONS & WAVEFORMS Air-to-Air Search, Acquisition and Track — Medium PRF.  It may be instruc - tive to examine how several modes are generated and processed to understand why the  waveforms must be the way they are. 
Medium PRF trades long-range detection perfor - mance (see Figure 5.21, later in the chapter) for all aspect target detection.28,52,53 Often  high and medium PRF waveforms are interleaved on alternate scans (see Figure 5.20) to  improve total performance.28,54,55 After 30 years of searching for an optimum set, most  modern medium PRF modes have devolved to a range of PRFs between 8 and 20 kHz  in a detection set of 8 for the time on target.44,56–61 These PRFs are chosen to minimize  range and velocity blind zones while simultaneously allowing unambiguous resolu - tion of target range and doppler returns in a sparse target space.62,63,64 Range blind  zones are those ranges in which a target is eclipsed by the transmitted pulse. Velocity  or doppler blind zones are those velocities or dopplers that are excluded due to the FIGURE 5.14  Typical MFAR timing sequences7,8,9 (Courtesy SciTech Publishing ) ch05.indd   16 12/17/07   1:26:47 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.176x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 main-beam clutter and ground moving target filter rejection notch. Target detec - tion requires detections in at least 3 of the 8 PRFs with all PRFs clear at maximum  range. 
The PRF selection criteria usually requires that the PRF set is 96% clear—in  other words, at least a specified number (typically 3) of PRFs must have an above  threshold return echo for the minimum specified target for the full specified range- doppler coverage. A typical processing block diagram is given in Figure 5.15. Each PRF processing  interval is different, but they average out to an optimum, as shown later in Figure 5.17. 
 Both main and guard channel processing is required to reject false targets.25 Some  STAP processing may have been performed before this process, but traditional side- lobe and main-beam clutter is less of a limit than ground moving targets, which have  very large cross sections and exo-dopplers (i.e., doppler far enough out of main-beam  clutter that detection is not limited by the clutter return). MPRF usually has a small  amount of pulse compression (1:1 to 169:1), which still may require doppler compen - sation.65 Main and guard channels are processed in the same way. Obviously, the two  spectra are quite different and separate false alarm and noise ensemble estimates are  made. 
This leads to separate threshold settings. Multiple channels are used to estimate  interference and select ECCM strategy. Main channel detections are examined for  GMTs and centroided in range and doppler (because a return in range or doppler may  straddle multiple bins, the centroid of those returns in multiple bins must be estimated  from the amplitude in each bin and the number of bins straddled). 
The guard channel  is detected and the thresholded results are used to gate the main channel results for the  final hit-miss count. Genuine targets are resolved in range and doppler, presented to a  display and used for TWS correlation and tracking.8 False alarms are a critical issue in most radar modes. These are usually suppressed  for thermal noise by constant false alarm rate thresholding, coincidence detection,  and post-detection integration with frequency agility. 
Clutter false alarms are sup - pressed by adaptive aperture tapering, low-noise front-end hardware, wide dynamic  range A/Ds, clutter rejection filtering (including STAP), pulse compression sidelobe  suppression, doppler filter sidelobe control, guard channel processing, radome reflec - tion lobe compensation, angle ratio tests (see Figure 5.37 and the “fringe region” for  an example angle-ratio- test), and adaptive PRF selection.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.18  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 MPRF-Typical Range-Doppler Blind Map.  For example, a typical MPRF set  for X band with range-doppler coverage of 150 km–100 kHz is shown in Figure 5.16. 
 This set is for a 3 ° antenna beamwidth, ownship (i.e., the radar carrying fighter)  velocity of 300 m/s, and an angle off the velocity vector of 30 °. The PRF set is 8.88,  10.85, 12.04, 12.82, 14.11, 14.80, 15.98, and 16.77 kHz. Historically, a PRF set was  calculated during design and remained fixed during deployment. 
Modern multifunc - tional radar computing is so robust that PRF sets can be selected in real time based  on situation geometry and look angle. The set, which generated Figure 5.16, on the  average is clear on 5.6 out of 8 PRFs for a single target. Except for two small doppler  regions, all the PRFs are clear at maximum range, which provides maximum detec - tion and minimum loss at the design range. 
For some pulse compression waveforms,  the eclipsing loss is almost linear and partial overlap still allows shorter-range detec - tion. Eclipsing loss is that diminishment of received power when the receiver is  off during the transmitted pulse. It is often the largest single loss in high duty ratio  waveforms. 
The bad news is that the average detection power loss is slightly over  3 dB (see Figure 5.21). MPRF Selection Algorithms.  Obviously, selecting PRFs in real time requires  several rules to get close to a final set. 
This is followed by small iterations to pick the  optimum set. For medium PRF, both range and velocity blind zones are important.52,65  First, the software must pick a central PRF about which all the other PRFs are devia - tions to fill out the desired visibility criteria. Second, the PRF set should all be clear at  the maximum design range so that detection losses are at a minimum. 
Figure 5.17 shows one example criteria for selecting the central PRF, i.e., the high - est probability of visibility ( PV).45 In the example, the product ( PV) of the range ( PR)  and doppler ( PD) target visibility probabilities for a single PRF peaks at approximately  0.47 and thus the other PRFs must fill in to reach 96% clear or higher. There are several FIGURE 5.16  Medium PRF range-velocity blind zones ch05.indd   18 12/17/07   1:26:49 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.196x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 other factors to be considered: doppler and range blind zones and eclipsing and side- lobe clutter. Even with STAP, sidelobe clutter is a major limitation.67,68,93 Both sidelobe  and main-beam clutter can be minimized by narrow doppler and/or range bins (i.e.,  resolution cells), which imply longer dwell times and higher transmit bandwidth. 
One example method for selecting a set of PRFs for MPRF is given in Eq. 5.1. The  basic idea is to find a time interval, TA, representing the desired maximum clear range,  and then to choose a set of PRIs in which all will be clear at maximum range. 
This can  be achieved by dividing TA by an integer, typically 9 to 17. This set will generally not  provide 96% clear over the range-doppler space. The even divisor PRIs can be perturbed  iteratively by a small amount to achieve the desired visibility. 
The normalized target sig - nal-to-noise ratio, TP , varies dramatically with straddle and eclipsing losses (for example,  see Figure 5.18). The function to be optimized is a thresholded version of TPk or j.FIGURE 5.17  Medium-PRF central PRF selection example45 FIGURE 5.18  Example RGHPRF eclipsing and straddle near maximum range ch05.indd   19 12/17/07   1:26:52 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.20  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 For example, the threshold scheme might be 15 dB SNR per PRI and 3 out of 8  for all PRIs. Often multiple and different thresholds are used for each CPI and PRI. 
 Lower thresholds are allowable for higher numbers of total hits.28 It should be noted  that eclipsing and straddling, and so on, have much less effect at closer ranges where  there is usually more than enough SNR. Another serendipitous effect of this selection  technique is that as an individual PRI range clear region gets smaller, the doppler clear  region gets larger, filling-in the blind zones in both dimensions.

Range-gated high PRF (RGHPRF) performance is  dramatically better for detection of higher speed closing targets.44,54,55,70 (Range gates  are often smaller than range resolution cells or bins). RGHPRF produces the longest  detection range against closing low cross section targets.71 Ultra-low noise frequency  references are required to improve subclutter visibility on low RCS targets even using  STAP. 
Range gating dramatically improves sidelobe clutter rejection, which allows  operation at lower ownship altitudes. Principal limitations of RGHPRF closing target  detection performance are eclipsing (a radar return when the receiver is off during the  transmitted pulse) and range gate straddle losses (the range gate sampling time misses  the peak of the radar return).15 Figure 5.18 shows TPi with eclipsing and straddle losses  near maximum range for a high performance RGHPRF. This mode is optimized for low  cross section targets out to just beyond 75 km maximum range. 
The particular example  has overlapping range gates to minimize straddle loss and two PRFs to allow at least  one clear PRF near maximum range. The PRFs are 101.7 kHz and 101.3 kHz. Duty  ratio is 10% with 15 dB required detection SNR. 
Averaged over all possible target posi - tions and closing dopplers, the losses for this mode are a surprisingly small 0.4 dB. The range-doppler blind zones plot is shown in Figure 5.19 corresponding to the  Figure 5.18 waveform. Compared to the medium PRF plot shown in Figure 5.16, the  clear region (and corresponding losses) is dramatically better. 
Unfortunately, range  is very ambiguous. Normally, a RGHPRF range-while-search (RWS) mode is inter - leaved with the highest performance velocity-search (VS) mode to range on previ - ously detected targets. Often, RWS is RGHPRF with three phases in which a constant frequency and two  chirp (linear FM) frequencies (triangular up-down or up-steeper up) are used to resolve  range and doppler in a sparse target space. 
At low altitudes, sidelobe clutter, even   with STAP processing, limits performance for all targets but especially opening targets.   ch05.indd   20 12/17/07   1:26:54 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.216x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 This limitation leads to the need for another mode interleaved with RGHPRF.  Fortunately, the timeline for opening targets is much longer (net speed is less) and the  engagement range is much shorter (weapon closure rates are too slow). 
Often in general search, MPRF-VRS (medium PRF velocity-range search) is  interleaved with HPRF VS and RWS, as shown in Figure 5.20, to provide all aspect  detection. Unfortunately, both RWS and VRS have poorer maximum detection range.  RGHPRF can provide all aspect detection but tail performance is dramatically poorer  due to sidelobe clutter. 
Even with STAP, which significantly improves sidelobe clutter  rejection, low altitude tail aspect detection for RGHPRF is poorer .44,45,55FIGURE 5.19  RGHPRF range-velocity blind zones, corresponding to Figure 5.18 waveforms FIGURE 5.20  High and medium PRF interleave for all aspect detection45 ch05.indd   21 12/17/07   1:26:56 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

5.22  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 An example comparison of HPRF and MPRF as a function of altitude for a given  maximum transmitter power, power-aperture product, and typical antenna and radome  integrated sidelobe ratio is shown in Figure 5.21. At high altitude and nose-on, there is  more than an 11 dB difference caused by blind zones, straddle, folded clutter, process - ing, and thresholding losses.9,11,28 RGHPRF Selection Algorithms.  First, as in the MPRF case, all PRFs should be  clear at the maximum design range. 
Second, all PRFs should be clear to the maximum  doppler of interest. One possible selection criteria is given in Eq. 5.2. 
Although the  details are quite different, the basic philosophy in PRF selection is to optimize long- range clear regions.  TR cPRIV VIT PRAc p A a tA=×+ =× +=2 0 25τλand and ceil.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.236x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 identification methods such as JTIDS, IFF, and RF tagging that can be unique. TID   depends on detecting features of the radar signature in fusion with emissions and  other sensors. 
The five most common TID signatures are monopulse extent (similar  to the example shown in Figure 5.25), resonances, high resolution range (HRR)  profiles, doppler spread, stepped frequency waveform modulation or multifre - quency (SFWM/MFR), which can be transformed into a range profile, and inverse  synthetic aperture radar (ISAR).16,45 Monopulse extent allows estimation of length  and width as well as separation of closely spaced aircraft. A high range resolution  profile also allows the separation of targets flying in close formation as well as the  separation of a missile from a target. A high range resolution profile on a single  target can allow recognition, assuming the target attitude is known or has been  guessed. 
Length, width, and location of major scattering features can be projected  into a range profile if the attitude is known. The number of types of major civilian  and military aircraft and ships is at most a few thousand, easily storable in memory.  Unfortunately, recognition is limited to broad categories rather than MIG-29M2  versus MIG-29S (even though there are significant differences that air show visi - tors can easily see89). 
The basic notion of doppler, resonances, stepped (SFWM), and multifrequency  (MFR) signatures is modulation either by reflections from moving parts, e.g., engine  compressor, turbine, rotor, or propeller blades, or by interactions from scatterers along  the aircraft or vehicle, e.g., fuselage, wing, antennas, or stores. SFWM/MFR signa - tures are closely related to high range resolution signatures (a Fourier transform easily  converts one to the other), and they suffer the same attitude estimation limitations. The  principal advantage to MFR is that many deployed radars have multiple channels and  switching between them on a single target is relatively easy. 
A simplified version of  the recognition process is summarized in Figure 5.22. Doppler signatures require high doppler resolution, which is usually easily achieved  and limited only by dwell time. The individual scatterers, which give rise to doppler  spread, are small and so recognition is usually limited to a fraction (1/2 typical) of  maximum range. 
Jet engine modulation (JEM), a subset of doppler signatures, is an  excellent target recognition method. Even aircraft, which use the same engine type,  often have variations in the engine application, such as the number of compressor  blades or number of engines, which allows unique type recognition. The real picture  of JEM is not so clean because of multiple on-aircraft bounces, straddling, and speed  variations, but centroiding of each line improves the signature estimate. 
The last  method of TID, ISAR, will be dealt with in another section. ISAR works well on both  aircraft and ships. A typical tail hemisphere air-to-air ISAR is shown in Figure 5.23.

5.24  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 The fusion of the recognition of each of the signatures above provides excellent  noncooperative recognition. Weather Avoidance.  Many aircraft have separate weather radars. 
Weather  avoidance is normally incorporated into modern fighter radars. The normal operating  frequency for a fighter radar has not been considered optimum for weather detection  and avoidance15—primarily due to lack of penetration depth into a storm and reduced  operating range. However, with complex atmospheric attenuation compensation and  doppler methods, weather can be detected well enough to allow warning and avoid - ance of storms. 
The principal challenge is compensating for backscatter from the  leading edge of a storm and adjusting for attenuation to see far enough into a storm to  evaluate its severity. The backscatter from each cell is measured, the power remaining  is calculated, the attenuation in the next cell is estimated, and then the backscatter in  the next cell is measured, and so on. When the power in the cells drops to the noise  level, those cells behind it are declared blind. 
Since penetration range into a storm is  not great, the MFAR weather mode usually has provisions to mark the last visible or  reliable range on the weather display. This is so the pilot does not fly into a dark area  believing there is no weather. Air Data Links. 
 The MFAR is part of a network of sensors and informa - tion sources (C3ISR net) sometimes called the Global Information Grid (GIG) .   A major use of radar and aircraft data links is to provide total situational awareness.21   By using on-board and off-board sensor fusion, a total air and ground picture  can be presented in the cockpit. This picture can be a combination of data from  FIGURE 5.23  A-A ISAR example TA-3B45 ch05.indd   24 12/17/07   1:27:02 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Because the modern fighter is net-centric, using everything  available on- and off-board the aircraft, net-centric operation requires dramatically  higher levels of data exchange and fusion of data for presentation to the operator.  Radar modes can be scheduled between multiple aircraft in real time through the   data links. The two main uses for data links associated with high performance aircraft are  high bandwidth imagery transmission from a weapon or sensor platform to a second  platform or ground station and low bandwidth transmission of context, targeting data,  guidance, and housekeeping commands.74–79 The largest quantity of data links are  associated with weapons. 
The waveform selected to transmit this and other data must  not compromise the signature of the platform at either end of the link.8,34–37 There are numerous data links on fighters. Table 5.3 shows air data links that might  be on a fighter platform. In spite of this fact, the radar or part of its aperture is often  used for a data link, especially to missiles on the fly and in response to peacetime  air traffic control interrogations. 
Pulse amplitude (including on-off), pulse position,  phase shift, and frequency shift modulation are commonly used. Links may be unidi - rectional or bidirectional. Some missiles require semi-active illumination as well as  reference signals and midcourse command data derived from missile and target track - ing. 
The data to and from the missile is often an encrypted phase-code in or near the  radar operating band. In some cases, the frequency channel is randomly selected at  the factory and hardwired into the missile. Frequency channels are typically selected  or communicated to the radar immediately before launch. 
If the data link frequency is  well below the radar band, usually a small number of radiators at that lower frequency  are imbedded in the radar aperture. If the frequency is close enough to the radar band,  the radar aperture or a segment of the aperture is used. Radar Aperture Datalinking.81 Historically, datalink functions embedded in  MFARs have been used for the midcourse guidance of missiles. 
An emerging applica - tion is the use of the radar aperture as a high power, high gain primary datalink antenna,  Link Freq Band Data Rate (kb/s) ECCM ARC-164 UHF 1.8 High ARC-126 UHF 1.8 High ARC-201 VHF    8 Moderate ARC-210 VHF/UHF    8 Moderate–High TADIL UHF-L 1.8–56.6 Moderate–High JTIDS L 28.8–56.6 Moderate JTIDS LET L 383.6–1,180.8 Moderate JTRS VHF-X 1.8–1,544 Moderate–High TADIXS UHF 9.6 Moderate MFAR X-Ku 2–105 Moderate–High Milstar UHF, Ku - Ka 4.8–1,544 High TCDL X - Ku 1,000–256,000 ModerateTABLE 5.3 Air Data Links80 ch05.indd   25 12/17/07   1:27:03 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

5.26  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 where datalink transmission and reception are interleaved with other modes. The prin - cipal limitation of most general-purpose datalink equipment is the low power-aperture  performance associated with omnidirectional, often shared, antenna apertures and lim - ited power levels. This constrains achievable data transfer rates, regardless of channel  bandwidth. 
An associated problem is vulnerability to intercept and jamming inherent in  widebeam apertures. An X or Ku band MFAR can emit power levels in the multi-kilo - watt range with main-beam beamwidths of a few degrees, affording high data rates and  significant resistance to jamming and intercept. Transmit data rates of over 500 Mbps,  and receive data rates of up to 1 Gbps have been demonstrated using a production AESA  and a modified Common Data Link (CDL) waveform.82 Modeling using representative  MFAR parameters indicates that performance bounds are at several Gbps throughput  over distances in excess of 400 nautical miles, subject to MFAR performance, platform  altitude, tropospheric conditions, and forward scattering effects.81 Implementation requires accurate antenna pointing, since there is relative motion  with respect to the other end of the link. 
One technique involves the use of an out-of- band datalink channel, e.g., JTIDS, to carry GPS position updates.83 Doppler shifting  due to link geometry dynamics must be actively compensated. A related issue is syn - chronization in time to allocate transmission and reception windows and to synchronize  timebases. When existing waveforms must be used, this can present challenges. 
Existing  aperture scheduling algorithms can then allocate time for transmission or reception.81 To achieve very high throughputs, phase linearity in transmit and receive paths  is critical since data transmission waveforms rely on modulation that is every bit as  complex as many radar modes. This can also impact choice of taper function because  angular variations in phase across the main-beam wavefront may incur performance  penalties. Where the MFAR is phase steered, aperture fill and sidelobe steering effects  constrain usable aperture bandwidth similar to SAR limitations. 
The latter is because  the element phase angles required to point the main beam are not the same as those for  the outer sidelobes of the modulation used.81 Low bandwidth data links can use all the radar bandwidth to improve encryption  and signal-to-jam ratios. However, the data link on a weapon is traveling to the target,  which will inevitably attempt to protect itself. When the weapon is near the target,  the signal-to-jam ratio can be very unfavorable. 
Antenna jammer nulling is usually  required since transmitting more power to burn through may not be possible. Clearly,  the data from and to a weapon must also be sufficiently encrypted to prevent take-over  of the weapon in flight.8 Time synchronized with a radar transmission on a different set of beams and/or fre - quencies, messages are sent to one or more missiles on the fly to the targets. Obviously,  all the random frequency diversity, spread spectrum, and encryption necessary for  robust communication should be incorporated into the message.78 Each missile may  answer back at a known but randomized offset frequency and time with image or  housekeeping data. 
Again a waveform as robust as possible is used, but since the base - band data and link geometry may be quite different, the data compression, diversity,  and encryption may be different. The missile datalink waveform usually must be stealthy and greatly attenuated in  the direction of the target since one countermeasures strategy is a deception repeater  jammer at the target. High accuracy time and frequency synchronization, including  range opening and doppler effects between both ends of the link can dramatically  reduce the effectiveness of jamming by narrowing the susceptibility window. 
Time  and frequency synchronization also minimizes acquisition or reacquisition time. ch05.indd   26 12/17/07   1:27:04 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies. All rights reserved.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.276x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 An aircraft using a data link is moving with respect to the other end of the link,  so the link geometry is continually changing in time, frequency, aspect, and attitude.  The signal processor will generate waveforms for transmission by the seeker or data  link. 
It will also measure target range, angle, doppler, and so on, and provide those to  the other platform. The MFAR signal processor sends motion sensing and navigation  estimates to correct measurements; to track, encode, and decode datalink messages;  and to perform jammer nulling. Beacon Rendezvous and Station Keeping. 
 Most modern military aircraft  depend on in-flight refueling for many missions. This requires rendezvous with tanker  aircraft during all weather conditions as well as station keeping until aircraft currently  in line for refueling depart. This may involve detecting a coded beacon on the tanker,  skin tracking tankers and other aircraft at close range. 
Station keeping ranges can be  between 30 and 1000s of meters. Special short-range radar modes are usually used for  this purpose. Low power, short pulse or FM-CW waveforms are often used. 
One meter  accuracy and 30 meter minimum range is usually required for blind tanking. High Power-Aperture Jamming.  The basic notion behind MFAR high power- aperture jamming is suggested in Figure 5.24.9,11,71,84 A threat emitter, whether surface or airborne, is first detected and recognized  by the spherical coverage radar warning receiver (RWR) function (possibly just an  application overlay on the RF and processing infrastructure shown in Figure 5.4). 
 If the intercept is inside the radar field of view (FOV), fine angle-of-arrival (AOA)  and possibly burst ranging are performed with the primary radar aperture, as shown  in the top portion of Figure 5.24. High-gain electronic support measures (ESM) are  then performed and recorded on the emitter main beam or sidelobes using the nose  aperture. If it is determined from an on-board threat table, current rules of engage - ment, or mission plan, high power density jamming based on the corresponding  on-board techniques table may be initiated using the high-gain nose aperture.84   FIGURE 5.24  MFAR ECM example9 ch05.indd   27 12/17/07   1:27:05 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.28  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 Because the adversary radar may also be a MFAR, threat tables will be required to  categorize them by their apparent statistical nature. 
Old style matching by PRF, pulse - width, and pulse train envelope won’t work very well because waveforms vary so  much. The typical nose aperture radar–based effective radiated peak power (ERPP)  can easily exceed 75 dBW, which is normally more than enough to play hob with threat  radars.39,85 For example, assuming a 10 GHz in-band signal, –3 dBi threat sidelobe,  and –110 dBW threat sensitivity, a jamming pulse 60 dB above minimum sensitivity  can be generated at 20 km. Obviously, in the near sidelobes or main beam, the range  for a 60 dB pulse will be much greater.84 5.4 A-S MODE DESCRIPTIONS & WAVEFORMS Terrain Following, Terrain Avoidance. 
 The next example is terrain following,  terrain avoidance (TF/TA) shown in Figure 5.25. In terrain following (TF), the antenna  scans several vertical bars oriented along the aircraft velocity vector and generates an  altitude-range profile that is sometimes displayed to the pilot on an E-scan display.  Depending on the aircraft’s maneuvering capabilities, there is a control profile 1g  acceleration maneuver control line shown as an upward curving line in the upper right  of Figure 5.25.86–8 8 If this conceptual line intercepts the terrain anywhere in range, an  automatic up maneuver is performed. 
There is also a conceptual pushover line, not  shown in the figure, which causes a corresponding down maneuver. The control pro - file in modern aircraft is automatic because a human pilot does not have the reflexes  to avoid all possible detected obstacles. In terrain avoidance (TA), the antenna scan is in a horizontal plane (shown in the  upper left of Figure 5.25). 
Several altitude plane cuts are estimated and presented to  FIGURE 5.25  TF/TA mode example ( adapted8; courtesy SciTech Publishing ) ch05.indd   28 12/17/07   1:27:07 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.296x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 the pilot on an azimuth-range display (shown in the lower right of Figure 5.25). The  terrain avoidance scan pattern shows all the terrain that is near or above the flight  altitude and one cut below at a set clearance altitude (500 ft. typically).86 Figure 5.25  (lower left and lower right) shows the situation geometry of an aircraft flying toward  two hills and the corresponding altitude cuts displayed to the pilot. 
This allows either  manual or automatic turning flight to maintain a lower altitude. TF/TA allows an aircraft to penetrate at low altitude using the terrain as masking,  thus preventing early detection. TF/TA is an important aspect of stealth even when the  altitude is not all that low because lower altitudes provide some terrain obscuration  and many other competing targets with similar cross-sections.8 Terrain Height Estimation. 
 Some of the features of TF/TA are the required scan  pattern, the number of independent frequency looks required to obtain a valid estimate  of the height of a possibly scintillating object along the flight path, and the range cov - erage. Because terrain height is estimated through an elevation measurement, angle  accuracy is critical. The range coverage, although short, requires multiple overlapping  beams and multiple waveforms. 
One method for calculating terrain height8 is shown in  Figure 5.26. It consists of measuring the centroid and extent of each individual beam  position over many pulses and estimating the top of the terrain in each beam, as shown  in the figure. The calculation is summarized in Eq.

Usually the range-elevation profile is measured in multiple segments with separate  PRFs and pulsewidths. 
The lowest PRF is used to measure the longest-range portion  of the profile at the top of the elevation scan. It uses the largest pulse compression ratio  (16:1–32:1). Each beam position overlaps by as much as 90% and multiple frequency  FIGURE 5.26  Terrain height estimation8 (Courtesy SciTech Publishing ) ch05.indd   29 12/17/07   1:27:09 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

The shortest range at the  bottom of the elevation scan uses a short pulse with no pulse compression and a much  higher PRF, but the same number of looks. The pulses in a TOT are all the pulses that  illuminate a single spot from the overlapping beams. Each overlapping beam must be  compensated for the antenna look angle before the beams can be summed for a terrain  height estimate from all the beams.8 The radar cross section of the terrain could be  quite low (e.g., snow-covered level treeless terrain), so some pulses may be integrated  coherently to improve signal-to-noise ratio for a CPI of up to 8 pulses, as shown in the  TF/TA entry in Table 5.1. 
Terrain Database Merging.  For the purposes of safety as well as stealth, active  radar measurements are merged with a prestored terrain database.87 Figure 5.27 shows  the general concept of merged TF/TA measurements with stored data. Active radar measurements are made out to a few miles. 
The instant use terrain data - base extends out to perhaps ten miles. The terrain database cannot be completely current  and may contain certain systematic errors. For example, the database cannot contain  the height of wires strung between towers or structures erected since the database was  prepared. 
For the lowest possible flight profiles with less than 10–6 probability of crash  per mission, the prestored data is merged and verified with active radar measurements.  Low crash probabilities may also require some hardware and software redundancy. In  addition, as the aircraft flies directly over a piece of terrain, combined terrain profile is  verified by a radar altimeter function (TERCOM/TERPROM) in the RF and processor  complex. 
Usually the prestored data is generated at the required resolution before a  mission from the worldwide digital terrain elevation database (DTED). Sea Surface Search, Acquisition, and Track.  Sea surface search, acquisition,  and track are oriented toward three types of targets: surface ships, submarines snorkel - ing or near the surface, and search and rescue. 
Tracking may be preliminary to attack  with antiship weapons. Although most ships are large radar targets, they move rela - tively slowly compared to land vehicles and aircraft. In addition, sea clutter exhibits  both current and wind-driven motion as well as “spiky” behavior. 
These facts often  require high resolution and multiple looks in frequency or time to allow smoothing of  sea clutter for stable detection and track.16,45 If the target is a significant surface ves - sel, then RCS might be 1000 m2, and a 30 m range resolution might be used for search  FIGURE 5.27  TF/TA terrain merging7,8,8 7 (Courtesy SciTech Publishing ) ch05.indd   30 12/17/07   1:27:10 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.316x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 and acquisition. If the target is a periscope or person in a life raft then 0.3 m resolu - tion might be used since the RCS might be less than 1 m2 and smoothing is especially  important. DPCA and doppler processing is often interleaved with traditional bright  (20 dB or greater above background) target detection. 
Lower PRFs are usually used,  which imply relatively high pulse compression ratios, as shown in Table 5.1. Scan  rates are often slow with one bar taking 10 seconds. A high range resolution profile can be used to recognize a ship just as with an  aircraft.72 It naturally has the same weakness previously mentioned, and the aspect  or attitude must be known. 
If the attitude is known, then the major scatterers can be  mapped into a range profile and correlated with the ship power return in each cell. An  example of a ship range profile is shown in Figure 5.28. These profiles are usually  generated in track when the profile is stabilized in range. 
The wake of a surface ship or submarine near the surface provides a substantial  cross section over time but requires surface stabilized integration over 10–100s of  seconds.16,45 Earth’s surface stabilized integration can be done using a motion com - pensated doppler beam sharpening (DBS) mode. Inverse SAR.  A far more reliable method of ship recognition is inverse synthetic  aperture radar (ISAR).16,72 The basic notion is that the motion of a rigid object can be  resolved into a translation and rotation with respect to the line of sight to the target. 
The  rotation gives rise to a differential rate of phase change across the object. The phase  history differences can be match filtered to resolve individual scatterers in a range cell.  Conceptually, such a matched filter is no different than a filter used to match a phase- coded pulse compression waveform. 
This is the basis of all SAR, RCS range imaging,  observed geometric target acceleration, turntable imaging, and ISAR. A ship in open water exhibits roll, pitch, and yaw motions about its center of grav - ity (c.g.). For example, Figure 5.29 shows a rolling motion of ± 2.3° that might be  exhibited by a ship in calm seas. 
The roll motion might have a period of 10 seconds.  The motion of almost all the scatterers on a large combatant are moving in arcs of  circles projected as segments of ellipses to a radar observer.45 For a radar observer the  change in range, dR, associated with a roll movement is a function of the height, h, FIGURE 5.28  Range profile ship recognition45 ch05.indd   31 12/17/07   1:27:11 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.32  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 of the scatterer above the center of gravity. The approximate range rate for each scat - terer in rolling (pitch, yaw) motion at a height, h, is the time derivative of R shown in  Figure 5.29. 
For a given desired cross range resolution with reasonable sidelobes, ∆rc,  b must be equal to ∆rc /l. For the example, 5 ft cross range resolution is obtainable  with a 10-second observation time. The corresponding doppler and doppler rates are  also given in Figure 5.29. 
For a ship whose principal scatterers are less than 85 ft above the center of gravity,  the dopplers will be in the range of ± 50 Hz at X band with a rate of change of up to   ± 31 Hz/s. As long as the image resolution is not too great, each range-doppler bin can  be match filtered using the hypothesized motion for each scatterer and an image can  be formed on the ship. Each range bin may contain multiple scatterers from the ship  in a given roll plane, and they may be distinguished by their differing phase history. 
 However, scatterers in the pitch axis at the same range and roll height cannot be sepa - rated. Although pitch and yaw motions are slower, they also exist and allow separation  in other similar planes. Reasonably good images coupled with experienced radar operators allow recogni - tion of most surface combatants. 
Recognition aids using prestored ship profiles allow  identification to hull number in many cases. An example of a single ISAR image of  a landing assault ship is given in Figure 5.30. The radar in this case is illuminating FIGURE 5.29  Inverse SAR notion45 FIGURE 5.30  Single ISAR ship image45 ch05.indd   32 12/17/07   1:27:13 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

The bright scatterers exhibit cross  range sidelobes, which can be partially reduced by sensing large returns, then apply - ing amplitude weighting and display compression, as has been done in this image.  Integration of multiple ISAR images dramatically improves quality . Air-to-Ground Ranging. 
 Air-to-ground ranging is used most often for target - ing of guns, dumb bombs, and missiles with short-range seekers against fixed or  slow moving targets. The target is detected and designated in some other mode  such as GMTI, DBS, SAR, or SSS. The designated target is tracked in range and  angle to provide a more accurate distance and angle to the target. 
The tracking  may be open or closed loop. The estimates are then provided to the weapon before  and after launch. Depending on distance, another designator, such as a laser, and  the radar may be alternately slaved to one another. 
Both the radar and the other  designator may be subject to atmospheric refraction, especially at low altitudes,  which is sometimes estimated and compensated. Precision Velocity Update.  Precision velocity update (PVU) is used for naviga - tion correction to an inertial platform. 
Although GPS updates are commonly used to  provide navigation in many situations, a military aircraft cannot depend solely on its  availability. Furthermore, inertial sensors are used to fill in between GPS measure - ments even under the best circumstances. Inertial sensors are extremely good over  short span times, but velocity drift is a major long-time error source, e.g., 1 km/h  accumulates 16.6 m error per minute. 
A radar mode may require position to 0.1 km  for proper operation. PVU generally uses three or more antenna beam positions in which it makes a  velocity measurement, as shown in Figure 5.31.15 This mode directly emulates dedi - cated radar doppler navigators. There is a three-stage velocity measurement process. 
 First, the surface is automatically acquired in range. Second, a fine range measurement  is made, often using monopulse discriminants and range centroiding similar to that  shown in Eq. 5.3. 
Third, a line-of-sight velocity measurement, VLOS, using doppler  and/or range rate, is made also using centroiding. Because terrain may be rising or fall - ing at the illuminated patches giving rise to velocity errors, terrain slope is estimated  and used to correct the estimated velocity.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.34  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 A Kalman filter (a recursive filter that adaptively combines models of target mea - surements and of errors10) is employed to provide a better estimate of aircraft velocity. 
 Although this procedure can be performed over land or water, sea currents make over- water measurements far less accurate. This velocity measurement provides in-flight  transfer alignment of the various inertial platforms (aircraft, weapons, and radar). A set  of outputs is provided to the mission management computer function, including North- East-Down (NED) velocity errors and estimates of statistical accuracies. 
Sniff or Passive Listening.  Most modes have a precursor subprogram called  sniff, which looks for passive detections in a tentative operating channel before any  radar emissions in that channel. The detections could be a friendly interferor, a jammer,  or an inadvertent interferor such as a faulty civilian communications transponder.99  This last example is the most common in the author’s experience. 
It is not uncommon  for a faulty transponder to appear as a million square meter tar get. Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS).16,45,97 DBS is very similar to synthetic aper - ture radar (SAR) since both use the doppler spread across the antenna main beam to  create higher resolution in the cross beam direction.8,9,28,52 The principal difference is  the amount of angular coverage, beam scanning, resolution, data gathering time, and  accuracy of matched filtering in each range-doppler cell. A DBS map may take a sec - ond to gather over an angle of 70 °. 
Depending on the angle from the aircraft velocity  vector, a SAR map of a few feet resolution may take tens of seconds to gather at X  band. DBS and SAR are compared in a qualitative way in Figure 5.32. As the beam is positioned closer to the velocity vector, the doppler spread is smaller  and so coherent dwell times must increase for the same resolution. 
Usually, there is a  transition from shorter coherent processing intervals (CPIs) and longer post detection  integrations (PDIs) to longer CPIs and shorter PDIs as the beam approaches the air - craft velocity vector. Near nose-on dwell times become prohibitive and the scan center  is filled with real beam mapping. The real beam uses the same range resolution, but  because returns from the entire beam are used, some amplitude equalization is required  to provide uniform contrast and brightness across the whole map. 
Some effort is made  FIGURE 5.32  Doppler beam sharpening (DBS) comparison to SAR9 ch05.indd   34 12/17/07   1:27:14 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

 MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.356x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 to match filter (both in range closure and phase history) the doppler spread since iso- range and iso-dopplers are not close to orthogonal near the aircraft velocity vector (see  Figure 5.8). SAR, on the other hand, is usually fully matched (relative to the desired  resolution and phase history) in every range-doppler cell. Figure 5.33 shows the signal processing that might be found in DBS mode. 
It  consists of multiple time around echo (MTAE) suppression, amplitude weighting to  improve sidelobes, presummation, an FFT filter bank, magnitude detection in each  usable filter output, placement of each filter output in the correct ground stabilized  location followed by post detection integration, and scaling for the display for con - stant brightness and dynamic range. Depending on grazing angle, ambiguous returns  may compete with the region to be imaged. Often, a combination of sensitivity time  control (STC) and pulse to pulse phase coding is used to reject multiple time around  echoes (MTAE).8,16,62,63 The amount of presummation (PRESUM) and post detection  integration (PDI) as a function of beam position off the velocity vector is shown in the  lower right of Figure 5.33. 
For each different angle, there is a different doppler spread  across the beam. Therefore, in order to maintain a constant beam-sharpening ratio,  different amounts of presumming must be used for each beam position. Presumming   is the formation of an unfocussed synthetic beam (i.e., there is little or no attempt to  match the exact phase history of surface points) inside the real antenna beam by what  is essentially a lowpass filter. 
This would result in different target brightness and con - trast if it were not compensated by applying a corresponding post detection integration  (PDI) for each angle, as shown in Figure 5.33. Multiple frequency looks are used to reduce speckle in the image and so several  different frequencies are PDIed. The CPI is the presum ratio times the number of filter  samples (128–800 is typical). 
Each CPI may have minor changes in the PRF to sim - plify processing and compensate for aircraft maneuvers. The aircraft may travel 1000 ft   during the gathering time. There is considerable transport delay in most SAR and  DBS processing; as a result, processed returns must be rectified (i.e., compensated for  geometric distortion), motion compensated, and mapped into the proper space angle  and range position. 
Since DBS usually maps a large area to provide overall ground  situational awareness, the total range coverage is often covered in multiple elevation  beams and range swaths. This is transparent to the operator but requires different  PRFs, pulsewidths, filter shapes, and dwell times.FIGURE 5.33  DBS processing ( adapted8; courtesy SciTech Publishing ) ch05.indd   35 12/17/07   1:27:15 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.36  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 Although an MFAR contains a very stable time reference, uncertainties in the rate  of change of terrain height, refraction, winds aloft, and very long coherent integration  times force the measurement of the clutter doppler error versus predicted frequency to  maintain proper focus and bin registration, as shown in the upper right in Figure 5.33.  A similar function is performed in SAR as well. 
Synthetic Aperture Radar.  As is the case for DBS, SAR is a multirate-filtering  problem, i.e., a cascade of filters in which the input sampling rate is higher than the  output sampling rate, as shown in Figure 5.35, which requires very careful attention to  range and azimuth filter sidelobes. Typically, the spacing of individual pulses on the  ground is chosen to be much closer than the desired ultimate resolution. 
This allows  linear range closure and phase correction since each point on the surface moves a  significant fraction of a range cell pulse to pulse.38,40–42,66,69,91 The input signal, point  A in Figure 5.34, is shown as a spectrum at A, folded about the PRF on the left in  Figure 5.35. Subsequently, presummation is applied, which forms an unfocussed synthetic beam  or filter inside the main-beam ground return (point B in Figure 5.34), which improves  azimuth sidelobes and narrows the spectrum, as suggested in the center graph shown  in Figure 5.35. The presummer output is resampled at a lower rate, fS, consistent with  acceptable filter aliasing. 
Then, range pulse compression is performed, assuming the  transmitted pulse is very long compared to the range swath. If chirp (linear FM) is used,  part of the “stretch” pulse compression processing is performed in the range compres - sion function with the remainder performed in polar format processing. The dechirped  and partially filtered or compressed output, shown at point C in Figure 5.34, may be  resampled again at a new fS, as indicated in the right graph shown in Figure 5.35, point  C. 
In any case, azimuth variable phase adjustment and bin mapping (which compen - sates for changes in measurement space angles and range closure since significant  motion occurs during the data gathering time) must be performed before azimuth filter - ing (sometimes called compression because it is similar to phase matched pulse com - pression). The output of azimuth compression is shown at point C. The complex SAR  output map must be checked for depth of focus and usually requires autofocus since  both atmospheric effects and locally rising or falling terrain may cause defocusing. 
 Subsequent to refocusing, the map is magnitude detected and histogram averaged to  maintain uniform brightness. The map is integrated with other looks, which requires  FIGURE 5.34  SAR processing ( adapted8; courtesy SciTech Publishing ) ch05.indd   36 12/17/07   1:27:16 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

The total map dynamic range can  easily be greater than 60 dB. 
The typical cockpit display is limited to 15–25 dB and  dynamic-range compression, such as converting map amplitudes into their logarithms,  is often performed. DBS or SAR PRF, Pulse Length and Compression Selection.  For each SAR  or DBS geometry, the transmitted pulse width, pulse repetition interval, and pulse  compression ratio must be calculated. 
One possible set of selection criteria is given  in Eq. 5.4.45 Usually, the last range ambiguity before the range swath is chosen to be outside  the main beam, far enough to be at least 20 dB down, including R4 effects. Often in  SAR, the transmitted pulse is much larger than the range swath, Rswath. 
Clearly, in  each of the cases, the nearest integral clock interval and nearest convenient pulse  compression ratio is selected because the values in Eq. 5.4 will be clock integers only  by coincidence.

Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) and Track (GMTT).  GMTI is  the detection and acquisition of ground moving targets. GMTI and GMTT radar  modes have a different set of challenges. 
First, target detection is usually the easy  part; the RCS of most anthropogenic objects and many natural moving targets is  large (10–1000 m2). Unfortunately, there are many stationary objects with moving  parts such as ventilators, fans, water courses, and power lines that lead to apparent  false alarms.93 Often slow-moving vehicles have fast-moving parts (e.g., helicop - ters and agricultural irrigators). Most areas have large numbers of vehicles and scatterers that could be vehicles. 
It is  typical to have up to 20,000 bona fide GMTs in the field of view. Processing capacity  must be adequate to handle and discriminate thousands of high SNR threshold crossings  and hundreds of moving targets of interest. Usually multi-hypothesis tracking10 filters  will be following several hundred GMTs of interest simultaneously. 
In most cases, all  targets must be tracked and then recognized on the basis of doppler spectrum (helicopters  vs. wheeled vehicles vs. tracked vehicles vs. 
scanning antennas), rate of measured loca - tion change (ventilator locations don’t change), and consistent trajectory (e.g., 60 mph  where there are no roads is improbable for a surface vehicle).94 In addition, vehicles of  interest may have relatively low radial velocities requiring endoclutter processing16 (i.e.,  far enough inside main-beam clutter that detection is limited for doppler only filtering). A processing block diagram for GMTI is shown in Figure 5.36. Although there  are alternate ways to perform endoclutter processing, a multiple phase center–based  FIGURE 5.36  Ground moving target detection processing ( adapted8; courtesy SciTech  Publishing ) ch05.indd   38 12/17/07   1:27:21 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Multiple channels or phase centers are  digitized and pulse compressed. Periodic calibration signals are used to create a gain,  phase and beam steering correction table for all frequencies, antenna beam steering,  and channels, which are then applied to the digitized measurements in each channel.  Motion compensation to a fraction of a wavelength for platform maneuvers or devia - tions is applied to the data. 
A coarse two-dimensional FFT is performed followed by  space-time adaptive calculations, and filter weighting is applied to reject some clut - ter and jamming. High resolution doppler filtering is performed in a conventional  FFT,90,96,97 perhaps with DPCA clutter cancellation. Doppler filter outputs are used  to form main-beam clutter error discriminants for precisely measuring doppler center  frequency to provide fraction of wavelength motion compensation. 
Main-beam clutter  is not in the same frequency location for each range bin, and so filter output order must  be adjusted to present a common input to the threshold detector. The doppler filter  bank outputs also are applied to a multilevel threshold detector for ground moving  target detection similar to those described in “Ground Moving Target Thresholding.”  Sum and difference discriminant functions are formed and stored in buffer storage for  each detected moving target to improve target tracking and geolocation accuracy. Often PRFs are ambiguous in both range and doppler but unambiguous inside  the main beam and near sidelobes (i.e., there is only one range or doppler ambigu - ity interval in the main beam and near sidelobes). 
PRF selection is similar to A-A  MPRF. Usually fewer PRFs are used; four or five are typical.97 A range ambigu - ity may be in the main beam at low grazing angles. Two out of four or three out  of five is usually the final detection criteria. 
PRFs typically are 4–8 kHz. Coded  waveforms are often used to reject ambiguous returns outside the antenna main  beam that compete with the region of interest. A 10 ft range cell size is often used  to match the smallest vehicle of interest and to reduce background clutter. 
Ground  moving target recognition may require 0.25 ft resolution. Antenna illumination  must be ground stabilized since the aircraft will engage in both intentional and  unintentional maneuvers.94 Ground Moving Target Thresholding.  The typical multilevel threshold has  several unique features. 
In addition to the obvious alert-confirm properties (a double  thresholding method in which a lower first threshold nominates radar returns as pos - sible targets to be confirmed by a return observation with a higher threshold), it also  uses multiple phase center discriminants as well as near sidelobe threshold multipli - ers.94 Even with STAP, the non-gaussian nature of clutter requires higher thresholds in  the main beam and near sidelobes.98 Threshold crossings are correlated in range and  doppler and buffered along with corresponding phase center discriminants, which are  presented to tracking filters or activity counters. There are three regions of thresholding: main-beam clutter-limited detection, near  sidelobe clutter-limited detection, and thermal-noise-limited detection. Near surface  targets of interest will often have radial velocities of a few miles per hour for long  periods of time, which forces the detection of ground moving targets well into main- beam clutter. 
Phase monopulse, DPCA, or STAP processing allows the first order  cancellation of clutter for many slow-moving targets. Unfortunately, clutter does not  always have well-behaved statistical tails, and to maintain a constant false alarm rate,  the threshold must be raised for endoclutter targets. The output of the doppler filter  bank might be thought of as a two dimensional range-doppler image. 
There will still be  parts of main-beam clutter that are completely discarded except for motion compensa - tion because clutter cancellation is inadequate.98 ch05.indd   39 12/17/07   1:27:22 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

5.40  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 An example thresholding scheme based on these concepts is shown in Figure 5.37.  The range-doppler space is broken up into a grid of range bins and doppler filters, as  shown in the figure. Each cell in the grid might be 64 × 64 range-doppler bins with 256  grid cells total. 
Some grid locations close to main-beam clutter (MLC in figure) are  used for forming main-beam clutter discriminants only and are otherwise discarded.  The bins (642 in the example) in each grid cell are ensemble averaged (EA) in sum and  difference channels. The power in each bin in a grid cell in the clear (thermal noise  limited) region is compared to a threshold, PTH1(EA), which is a function of the EA  in that grid cell. 
In the endoclutter near sidelobe region, a discriminant, Cs, is formed  and used to provide additional clutter cancellation prior to thresholding. Again, the  threshold, PTH2(EA), is a function of the EA in that grid cell and a priori knowledge of  the clutter statistics. Although only one threshold is described, two are actually used  before hits and their corresponding discriminants are passed to the track files. 
All low  threshold hits are passed to activity counters. As complex as this thresholding scheme  seems to be, it is very detection power efficient. Typical GMT Weapon Delivery. 
 As mentioned previously, missile guidance  requires tracking of both targets and missiles (also bullets in gun laying radar; gun lay - ing is a term invented by the U.K during WWII for radar pointing of antiaircraft guns).  Range accuracy is at least an order of magnitude better than angle accuracy. Some  method must be used to improve angle accuracy for weapon delivery. 
An example pro - cessing diagram for GMT weapon delivery is shown in Figure 5.38. In this case, three  different classes of target or missile are tracked. A single waveform may be used to track  stationary, endo- and exoclutter moving targets, and missiles or bullets. 
Each class of  return, based on its range and doppler location, is separately tracked and geolocated.94 There are several common types of geolocation; many of them are based on using  either DTED or cartographic data. One method using cartographic data is shown  FIGURE 5.37  Multiregion GMT thresholding8 (Courtesy SciTech Publishing ) ch05.indd   40 12/17/07   1:27:23 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL RADAR SYSTEMS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT  5.416x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 in Figure 5.39. An error ellipse and its corresponding eccentricity are calculated for  each target. 
If the eccentricity is less than some arbitrary threshold (e.g., 0.866 rela - tive), the minimum perpendicular distance is calculated for road segments inside the  3-sigma ellipse. As shown in the figure, the perpendicular intercept may not lie inside  the road segment and will be discarded. The minimum distance for valid road segment  distances will be selected as the GMT location. 
If the eccentricity is greater than the  threshold, the road segments that have a major ellipse axis intercept inside 3 sigma  are compared, and the minimum distance is selected. Obviously, some other screening  must also be applied. For example, some roads cannot support high speeds and tanks  do not have to be on roads. 
A common SAR-MTI display may be presented to the operator. In addition, guid - ance commands or errors are derived from the measurements and provided to down - links to either missiles on the fly or gun directing computers for the next rounds.  Short-term coherent change detection may be used to separate stationary targets from  slow-moving endoclutter targets. 
Short-term coherent change detection is a method in  which two coherent SAR maps taken within a few hours of one another at the same  frequency are registered and cross-correlated pixel by pixel. The fast-moving target  category usually includes both targets and bullets or missiles.FIGURE 5.38  Typical GMT weapon guidance ( adapted8; courtesy SciTech Publishing ) FIGURE 5.39  Cartographic-assisted GMT geolocation94 ch05.indd   41 12/17/07   1:27:27 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Multifunctional Radar Systems for Fighter Aircraft. 5.42  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 5 Missile Performance Assessment, Track, and Update.  Missile midcourse guid - ance usually consists of assessing the missile performance, measurement of the target  and missile location, prediction of the path of each, and updating the resulting data to  the missile for the best future intercept of the target. 
It may also include the most current  estimate of the target type and attitude for best fuzing. The missile usually sends data  about its state of health, ownship measurements, remaining fuel amounts, and target  acquisition, if any.74 When the missile is close to the data link aircraft (which may or may  not be the launching platform), communication is often through an aperture other than in  the main MFAR. As the distance gets greater, the primary MFAR aperture is used. 
As the  data link aircraft maneuvers, the aperture that has the largest projected area in the direc - tion of the missile is used. The bandwidth to the missile is very low and can be redundant  and highly encrypted to provide good antijam (A/J) protection. If it contains imagery,  the uplink bandwidth from the missile is relatively large and will have comparatively  lower A/J performance. 
An adaptive MFAR primary aperture can improve a wider band  missile uplink A/J if the jammer is offset from the target. At the missile end, the missile  antenna can have jammer nulling to improve downlink A/J.43,85 AGC, Calibrate and Self-Test.  Usually at the beginning of a new mode, the  end of each scan bar, or once per second, the calibrate and self-test subprogram is  invoked by the operational flight program (OFP) executive. 
A sequence of subroutines  is executed that measures phase and gain unbalance between channels using a signal  injected on the antenna. This is usually done over a range of input amplitudes, frequen - cies, and AGC settings because of the nonlinear characteristics of most RF front ends.  Also for modes like TF/TA, a full set of off-angle diagnostics is performed, which  tests the integrity of the entire measurement, processing, and flight control chain often  enough to keep the probability of a failure-induced crash per flight below 10–6 in the  presence of jamming or component failures. 
In addition, there are initiated built-in tests at two levels: an operational readiness  test performed as part of mission initiation and a fault isolation test performed by the  maintenance crew in response to an operator deficiency report. Both tests take longer  and are more exhaustive. In the best case, the specific flight line or a first-level main - tenance replaceable assembly is identified with high probability. 
Such assemblies are  then sent to a depot for replacement, repair, failure tracking, and/or reclamation. For  assemblies that have a very low failure rate, it is usually cheaper to replace and reclaim  rather than repair even when the assembly is very expensive.
