Trunk The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory 7.1 INTRODUCTION As digital processing has increased in speed and digital hardware has decreased in cost  and size, radars have become more and more automated, so that automatic detection  and tracking (ADT) systems are associated with almost all but the simplest of radars.
In this chapter, automatic detection, automatic tracking, and sensor integration  techniques for surveillance radars are discussed.
Included in the discussion are vari - ous noncoherent integrators that provide target enhancement, thresholding techniques  for false alarms and target suppression, and algorithms for estimating target position  and resolving targets.
Then, an overview of the entire tracking system is given, fol - lowed by a discussion of its various components such as track initiation, correlation  logic, tracking filter, and maneuver-following logic.
Finally, the chapter concludes  with a discussion of sensor integration and radar netting, including both colocated and  multisite systems.
7.2 AUTOMATIC DETECTION In the 1940s, Marcum1 applied statistical decision theory to radar and later Swerling2  extended the work to fluctuating targets.
They investigated many of the statistical  problems associated with the noncoherent detection of targets in gaussian noise.
 (Note: If the inphase and quadrature components are gaussian distributed, the enve - lope is Rayleigh distributed and the power is exponentially distributed.) Marcum’s  most important result was the generation of curves of probability of detection ( PD) ver- sus signal-to-noise ratio ( S/N) for a detector that sums N envelope-detected samples  (either linear or square-law) under the assumption of equal signal amplitudes.
Whereas  for a phased array, the equal amplitude assumption is valid; for a rotating radar, the  returned signal amplitude is modulated by the antenna pattern as the beam sweeps over Chapter 7 7 .1 ch07.indd   1 12/17/07   2:12:45 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Many authors have investigated various detectors, comparing detection per - formance and angular estimation results with optimal values, and many of these results  are presented later in this section.
In the original work on detectors, the environment was assumed known and homo - geneous, so that fixed thresholds could be used.
However, a realistic radar environ - ment (e.g., containing land, sea, and rain) will cause an exorbitant number of false  alarms for a fixed-threshold system that does not utilize excellent coherent processing.
 Three main approaches—adaptive thresholding, nonparametric detectors, and clutter  maps—have been used to solve the noncoherent, false-alarm problem.
Both adaptive  thresholding and nonparametric detectors are based on the assumption that homo - geneity exists in a small region about the range cell that is being tested.
The adap - tive thresholding method assumes that the noise density is known except for a few  unknown parameters (e.g., the mean and the variance).
The surrounding reference  cells are then used to estimate the unknown parameters, and a threshold based on the  estimated density is obtained.
Nonparametric detectors obtain a constant false-alarm  rate (CFAR) by ranking (ordering the samples from smallest to largest) the test sample  with the reference cells.
Under the hypothesis that all the samples (test and refer - ence) are independent samples from an unknown density function, the rank of the test  sample is uniform; and consequently, a threshold that yields CFAR can be set.
Clutter  maps store an average background level for each range-azimuth cell.
A target is then  declared in a range-azimuth cell if the new value exceeds the average background level  by a specified amount.
Optimal Detector.
 The radar detection problem is a binary hypothesis-   testing problem in which H0 denotes the hypothesis that no target is present and H1  is the hypothesis that the target is present.
While several criteria (i.e., definitions of  optimality) can be used to solve this problem, the most appropriate for radar is the  Neyman-Pearson.3 This criterion maximizes the probability of detection PD for a given  probability of false alarm Pfa by comparing the likelihood ratio L (defined by Eq.
7.1)  to an appropriate threshold T that determines the Pfa.
A target is declared present if  L x xp x x H p x x HTnn n( , , )( , , | ) ( , , | )11 1 1 0…… …= ≥  (7.1) where p(x1,…, xn|H1) and p(x1,…, xn|H0) are the joint probability density functions of  the n observations xi under the conditions of target presence and target absence, respec - tively.
For a linear envelope detector, the samples have a Rayleigh density under H0  and a Ricean density under H1, and the likelihood ratio detector reduces to  in i iIA xT =∏  ≥ 10 2σ (7.2) where I0 is the modified Bessel function of zero order, s2 is the noise power, and Ai is  the target amplitude of the ith pulse and is proportional to the antenna power pattern.

The most  important facts concerning these detectors are the following: ● The detection performances of the linear and square-law detectors are similar, dif - fering only by less than 0.2 dB over wide ranges of PD, Pfa, and n.
● Because the signal return of a scanning radar is modulated by the antenna pattern, to  maximize the S/N when integrating a large number of pulses with no weighting (i.e.,  Ai = 1), only 0.84 of the pulses between the half-power points should be integrated,  and the antenna beam-shape factor (ABSF) is 1.6 dB.4 The ABSF is the number by  which the midbeam S/N must be reduced so that the detection curves generated for  equal signal amplitudes can be used for the scanning radar.
● The collapsing loss for the linear detector can be several decibels greater than the  loss for a square-law detector5 (see Figure 7.1).
The collapsing loss is the additional  signal required to maintain the same PD and Pfa when unwanted noise samples along  with the desired signal-plus-noise samples are integrated.
The number of signal sam - ples integrated is N, the number of extraneous noise samples integrated is M, and the  collapsing ratio r = (N + M)/N.
● Most automatic detectors are required not only to detect targets but also to make angu - lar estimates of the azimuth position of the target.
Swerling6 calculated the standard  deviation of the optimal estimate by using the Cramer-Rao lower bound.

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration 7 .4 RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 are shown in Figure 7.2, where a normalized standard deviation is plotted against the  midbeam S/N.
This result holds for a moderate or large number of pulses integrated,  and the optimal estimate involves finding the location where the correlation of the  returned signal and the derivative of the antenna pattern is zero.
Although this esti - mate is rarely implemented, its performance is approached by simple estimates.
Practical Detectors.
 Many different detectors (often called integrators ) are used  to accumulate the radar returns as the radar sweeps by a target.
A few of the most  common detectors7 are shown in Figure 7.3.
The feedback integrator8,9 and two-pole  filter10,11 are detectors that minimize the data storage requirements.
While these detec - tors may still be found in older radars, they probably would not be implemented in  new radars and will not be discussed in this edition.
Though all the detectors are  shown in Figure 7.3 as being constructed with shift registers, they would normally be  implemented with random-access memory.
The input to these detectors can be linear  video, square-law video, or log video.
Because linear video is probably the most com - monly used, the advantages and disadvantages of the various detectors will be stated  for this video.
Moving Window .
The moving window in Figure 7.3 a performs a running sum of  n pulses in each range cell,  Si = Si−1 + xi − xi−n (7.5) where Si is the sum at the ith pulse of the last n pulses and xi is the ith pulse.
The per - formance12 of this detector for n ≈ 10 is only 0.5 dB worse than the optimal detector  given by Eq.
7.3.
The detection performance can be obtained by using an ABSF of  1.6 dB and standard detection curves for equal amplitude pulses.
The angular estimate  that is obtained by either taking the maximum value of the running sum or taking the  midpoint between the first and last crossings of the detection threshold has a bias of  n/2 pulses, which is easily corrected.
The standard deviation of the estimation error of  both these estimators is about 20 percent higher than the optimal estimate specified 2 1 0.5 0.2 0.1 −2 0 S/N (dB)2 4 6 8 10 12N/qσ √FLUCTU ATING NON FLUCTU ATING FIGURE 7.2  Cramer-Rao bound for angular estimates for fluctuating and nonfluctuating targets; s  is the standard deviation of the estimation error, and N is the number of pulses within the 3-dB beam - width, which is q.

A disadvantage of this detector is that it is susceptible to  interference; that is, one large sample from interference can cause a detection.
This  problem can be minimized by using soft limiting.
The detection performance discussed previously is based on the assumption that the  target is centered in the moving window.
In the real situation, the radar scans over the  target, and decisions that are highly correlated are made at every pulse.
Hansen13 ana- lyzed this situation for N = 2, 4, 8, and 16 pulses and calculated the detection thresh - olds shown in Figure 7.4, the detection performance shown in Figure 7.5, and the  angular accuracy shown in Figure 7.6.
Comparing Hansen’s scanning calculation with  the single-point calculation, one concludes that about 1 dB of improvement is obtained  by making a decision at every pulse.
The angular error of the beam-splitting procedure  is about 20 percent greater than the optimal estimate.
For large signal-to-noise ratios,  the accuracy (rms error) of the beam-splitting and maximum-return procedures will be  limited by the pulse spacing8 and will approach  σ θ θ (ˆ)= ∆ / 12 (7.6) FIGURE 7.3  Block diagrams of various detectors.

Consequently, if the num - ber of pulses per beamwidth is small, the angular accuracy will be poor.
For instance,  if pulses are separated by 0.5 beamwidth, σ θ(ˆ)is bounded by 0.14 beamwidths.
 However, improved accuracy can be obtained by using the amplitudes of the radar  returns.

Because the estimate should lie between q1  and q2 and Eq.
7.7 will not always yield such an estimate, ˆθ should be set equal to q1  ifˆθ< q1 and ˆθ should be equal to q2 if ˆθ > q2.
The accuracy of this estimator is given  in Figure 7.7 for the case of n = 2 pulses per beamwidth.
This estimation procedure  can also be used to estimate the elevation angle of a target in multibeam systems where  q1 and q2 are the elevation-pointing angles of adjacent beams and A1 and A2 are the  corresponding amplitudes.
Binary Integrator .
The binary integrator is also known as the dual-threshold detec - tor, M-out-of-N detector, or rank detector (see “Nonparametric Detectors,” later in this  section), and numerous individuals have studied it.14–18 As shown in Figure 7.3 d, the  input samples are quantized to 0 or 1, depending on whether or not they are less than  a threshold T1.
The last N zeros and ones are summed (with a moving window) and  compared with a second threshold T2 = M.
For large N, the detection performance of  this detector is approximately 2 dB less than the moving-window integrator because  of the hard limiting of the data, and the angular estimation error is about 25 percent  greater than the Cramer-Rao lower bound.
Schwartz16 showed that within 0.2 dB the  optimal value of M for maximum PD is given by  M=1 5.N (7.9)FIGURE 7.6  Angular accuracy obtained with beam-splitting estimation procedure  for the no-fading case.

The optimal value of Pn, the probability of  exceeding T1 when only noise is present, was calculated by Dillard18 and is shown in  Figure 7.8.
The corresponding threshold T1 is  T1 = s (−2 ln PN)½ (7.10) A comparison of the optimal (best value of M) binary integrator with various other  procedures is given in Figures 7.9 and 7.10 for PD = 0.5 and 0.9, respectively.
The binary integrator is used in many radars because (1) it is easily implemented;  (2) it ignores interference spikes that cause trouble with integrators that directly use  signal amplitude; and (3) it works extremely well when the noise has a non-Rayleigh  density.19 For N = 3, comparison of the optimal binary integrator (3 out of 3), another  binary integrator (2 out of 3), and the moving-window detector in log-normal interfer - ence (an example of a non-Rayleigh density, where the log of the return has a gaussian  density) is shown in Figure 7.11.
The optimal binary integrator is much better than  the moving-window integrator.
The optimal values for log-normal interference were  calculated by Schleher19 and are M = 3, 8, and 25 for N = 3, 10, and 30, respectively.
Batch Processor .
The batch processor (Figure 7.3 e) is very useful when a large  number of pulses are within the 3-dB beamwidth.
If KN pulses are in the 3-dB beam - width, K pulses are summed (batched) and either a 0 or a 1 is declared, depending  on whether or not the batch is less than a threshold T1.

For instance, if there were 80 pulses  on target, one could batch 16 pulses, quantize this result to a 0 or a 1, and declare a target  with a 3-out-of-5 (or 2-out-of-5) binary integrator.
The detection performance of the  batch processor for a large number of pulses integrated is approximately 0.5 dB worse  than the moving window.
The batch processor has been successfully implemented by  the Applied Physics Laboratory20 of The Johns Hopkins University.
To obtain an accu - rate azimuth estimate ˆθ, approximately 20 percent greater than the lower bound,  ˆθθ=∑ ∑B Bi i i (7.11) is used, where Bi is the batch amplitude and qi is the azimuth angle corresponding to  the center of the batch.
False-Alarm Control.
 In the presence of clutter, if fixed thresholds are used with  the previously discussed integrators, an enormous number of detections will occur and  will saturate and disrupt the tracking computer associated with the radar system.
Four  important facts should be noted: ● A tracking system should be associated with the automatic detection system (the  only exception is when one displays multiple scans of detections).
● The Pfa of the detector should be matched to the tracking system to produce the  overall lowest S/N required to form a track without initiating too many false tracks  (see Figure 7.38, later in this chapter).
● Random false alarms and unwanted targets (e.g., stationary targets) are not a prob - lem if they are removed by the tracking system.
● Scan-to-scan processing can be used to remove stationary point clutter or moving- target indication (MTI) clutter residues.
One can limit the number of false alarms with a fixed-threshold system by setting  a very high threshold.
Unfortunately, this would reduce target sensitivity in regions of  low noise (clutter) return.
Three main approaches—adaptive threshold, nonparamet - ric detectors, and clutter maps—have been used to reduce the false-alarm problem.
 Adaptive thresholding and nonparametric detectors assume that the samples in the  range cells surrounding the test cell (called reference cells ) are independent and identi - cally distributed.
Furthermore, it is usually assumed that the time samples are indepen - dent.
Both kinds of detectors test whether the test cell has a return sufficiently larger  than the reference cells.
Clutter maps allow variation in space, but the clutter must be  stationary over several (typically 5 to 10) scans.
Clutter maps store an average back - ground level for each range-azimuth cell.
A target is then declared in a range-azimuth  cell if the new value exceeds the average background level by a specified amount.
Adaptive Thresholding .
The basic assumption of the adaptive thresholding tech - nique is that the probability density of the noise is known except for a few unknown  parameters.
The surrounding reference cells are then used to estimate the unknown  parameters, and a threshold based on the estimated parameters is obtained.
The sim - plest adaptive detector, shown in Figure 7.12, is the cell-average CFAR (constant  false-alarm rate) investigated by Finn and Johnson.21 If the noise has a Rayleigh den - sity, p(x) = x exp ( −x2/2s2)/s2, only the parameter s (s2 is the noise power) needs to  be estimated, and the threshold is of the form T = KΣxi = Knπ σ/2ˆ, where ˆσis the  ch07.indd   11 12/17/07   2:13:11 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

However, since T is set by an estimate ˆσ, it has some error and must be  slightly larger than the threshold that one would use if s were known exactly a priori.
 The raised threshold causes a loss in target sensitivity and is referred to as a CFAR  loss.
This loss has been calculated22 and is summarized in Table 7.1.
As can be seen,  for a small number of reference cells, the loss is large because of the poor estimate of  s.
Consequently, one would prefer to use a large number of reference cells.
However,  if one does this, the homogeneity assumption (i.e., all the reference cells are statisti - cally similar) might be violated.
A good rule of thumb is to use enough reference cells  so that the CFAR loss is below 1 dB and at the same time not let the reference cells  extend over a range interval that violates the homogenous background assumption.
 Unfortunately, for a specific radar this might not be feasible.
If there is uncertainty about whether or not the noise is Rayleigh-distributed, it is  better to threshold individual pulses and use a binary integrator as shown in Figure 7.13.
 This detector is tolerant of variations in the noise density because by setting K to yield  a 1 with probability 0.1, a Pfa ≈ 10−6 can be obtained by using a 7-out-of-9 detector.
 While noise may be non-Rayleigh, it will probably be very Rayleigh-like out to the  FIGURE 7.12  Cell-averaging CFAR.

Furthermore, one can use feedback based on several scans of data  to control K in order to maintain a desired Pfa on either a scan or a sector basis.
This  demonstrates a general rule: to maintain a low Pfa in various environments, adaptive  thresholding should be placed in front of the integrator.
If the noise power varies from pulse to pulse (as it would in jamming when fre - quency agility is employed), one must CFAR each pulse and then integrate.
While the  binary integrator performs this type of CFAR action, analysis23,24 has verified that the  ratio detector shown in Figure 7.14 is a better detector.

The denominator is the maximum-likelihood estimate of σi2, the  noise power per pulse.
The ratio detector will detect targets even though only a few  returned pulses have a high signal-to-noise ratio.
Unfortunately, this will also cause  the ratio detector to declare false alarms in the presence of narrow-pulse interference.
 To reduce the number of false alarms when narrow-pulse interference is present, the  individual power ratios can be soft-limited24 to a small enough value so that interfer - ence will cause only a few false alarms.
A comparison of the ratio detector with other  commonly used detectors is shown in Figures 7.15 and 7.16 for nonfluctuating and  fluctuating targets.
A typical performance in sidelobe jamming when the jamming  level varies by 20 dB per pulse is shown in Figure 7.17.

 It should be noted that the CFAR loss associated with a two-parameter threshold is  larger than those associated with a one-parameter threshold (see Table 7.1), and for  that reason, a two-parameter threshold is rarely used.

Thus, it should not be used in this situation.
However, if the correlation  time is less than a batching interval, the batch processor will yield a low Pfa without  modifications.
Target Suppression .
Target suppression is the loss in detectability caused by other  targets or clutter residues in the reference cells.
Basically, there are two approaches to  solving this problem: (1) remove large return from the calculation of the threshold25–27 or  (2) diminish the effects of large returns by either limiting or using log video.
The technique  that should be used is a function of the particular radar system and its environment.
Rickard and Dillard26 proposed a class of detectors DK, where the K largest samples  are censored (removed) from the reference cells.
A comparison of D0 (no censoring)  with D1 and D2 for a Swerling 2 target and a single square-law detected pulse is shown  in Figure 7.18, where N is the number of reference cells, b is the ratio of the power of  the interfering target to the target in the test cell, and the bracketed pair ( m, n) indicates  the Swerling models of the target and the interfering target, respectively.
As shown  in Figure 7.18, when one has an interfering target, the PD does not approach 1 as S/N  increases.
Another approach25 that censors samples in the reference cell if they exceed  a threshold is briefly discussed in the “Nonparametric Detector” subsection.
Finn27 investigated the problem of the reference cells spanning two continuous dif - ferent “noise” fields (e.g., thermal noise, sea clutter, etc.).
On the basis of the samples,  he estimated the statistical parameters of the two noise fields and the separation point  between them.
Then, only those reference cells that are in the noise field containing  the test cell are used to calculate the adaptive threshold.
An alternative approach for interfering targets is to use log video.
By taking the  log, large samples in the reference cells will have less effect than linear video on the  threshold.
The loss associated with using log video, rather than linear video, is 0.5 dB   FIGURE 7.18  Detection probability versus SNR for a Swerling Case 2 primary target  (after J.

In many systems, the antilog shown in  Figure 7.19 is not taken.
To maintain the same CFAR loss as for linear video, the  number of reference cells Mlog for the log CFAR should equal  Mlog = 1.65 Mlin − 0.65 (7.16) where Mlin is the number of reference cells for linear video.
The effect of target suppres - sion with log video is discussed later in this section (see Table 7.2, later in the chapter).
Nonparametric Detectors .
Usually nonparametric detectors obtain CFAR by rank - ing the test sample with the reference cells.30,31 Ranking means that one orders the  samples from the smallest to the largest and replaces the smallest with rank 0, the next  smallest with rank 1, .
.
.
, and the largest with rank n − 1.
Under the hypothesis that  all the samples are independent samples from an unknown density function, the test  sample has equal probability of taking on any of the n values.
For instance, referring to  the ranker in Figure 7.20, the test cell is compared with 15 of its neighbors.
Since, in the  set of 16 samples, the test sample has equal probability of being the smallest sample (or  equivalently any other rank), the probability that the test sample takes on values 0, 1, .
.
.
,  15 is 1/16.
A simple rank detector is constructed by comparing the rank with a threshold  K and generating a 1 if the rank is larger, a 0 otherwise.
The 0s and 1s are summed in a  moving window.
This detector incurs a CFAR loss of about 2 dB but achieves a fixed  Pfa for any unknown noise density as long as the time samples are independent.
This  detector was incorporated into the ARTS-3A postprocessor used in conjunction with the  Federal Aviation Administration airport surveillance radar (ASR).
The major shortcom - ing of this detector is that it is fairly susceptible to target suppression (e.g., if a large  target is in the reference cells, the test cell cannot receive the highest ranks).
If the time samples are correlated, the rank detector will not yield CFAR.
A mod - ified rank detector, called the modified generalized sign test (MGST),25 maintains  a low Pfa and is shown in Figure 7.21.
This detector can be divided into three parts:  a ranker, an integrator (in this case, a two-pole filter), and a threshold (decision  process).
A target is declared when the integrated output exceeds two thresholds.

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration 7 .18  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 The first threshold is fixed (equals m + T1/K in Figure 7.21) and yields Pfa = 10−6  when the reference cells are independent and identically distributed.
The second  threshold is adaptive and maintains a low Pfa when the reference samples are cor - related.
The device estimates the standard deviation of the correlated samples with  the mean deviate estimator, where extraneous targets in the reference cells have  been excluded from the estimate by use of a preliminary threshold T2.
The basic disadvantages of all nonparametric detectors are that (1) they have  relatively large CFAR losses; (2) they have problems with correlated samples; and   (3) one loses amplitude information, which can be a very important discriminant  between target and clutter.32 For example, a large return ( cross section ≥ 1000 m2) in  a clutter area is probably just clutter breakthrough.
See “Radar Detection Acceptance”  in Section 7.3.
Clutter Mapping.
 A clutter map uses adaptive thresholding where the threshold  is calculated from the return in the test cell on previous scans rather than from the sur - rounding reference cells on the same scan.
This technique has the advantage in that  for essentially stationary environments (e.g., land-based radar against ground clutter),  the radar has interclutter visibility—it can see between large clutter returns.
Lincoln  Laboratory33 in its moving-target detector (MTD) used a clutter map for the zero-dop - pler filter very effectively.
The decision threshold T for the ith cell is  T = A Si−1 (7.17) where the clutter is estimated using a simple feedback integrator  Si = K Si−1 + Xi (7.18) FIGURE 7.20  Rank detector: output of a comparator C is either a zero or a  one ( from G.

In the MTD used for the ASR application, K is 7/8, which effectively averages  the last eight scans.
The purpose of the clutter map is to detect, in clutter free areas,  crossing targets that would have been removed by the doppler processing.
The main  utility of clutter maps is with fixed-frequency, land-based radars.
While clutter maps  can be used with frequency-agile radars and on moving platforms (e.g., radars on  ships), they are not nearly as effective in these environments.
Target Resolution.
 In automatic detection systems, a single large target will prob - ably be detected (i.e., cross a detection threshold) many times, e.g., in adjacent range  cells, azimuth beams, and elevation beams.
Therefore, automatic detection systems  have algorithms for merging the individual detections into a single centroided detec - tion.
Most algorithms have been designed so that they will rarely split a single target  into two targets.
This procedure results in poor range resolution capability.
A merg - ing algorithm34 often used is the adjacent-detection merging algorithm, which decides  whether a new detection is adjacent to any of the previously determined sets of adjacent  detections.
If the new detection is adjacent to any detection in the set of adjacent detec - tions, it is added to the set.
Two detections are adjacent if two of their three parameters  (range, azimuth, and elevation) are the same and the other parameter differs by the  resolution element: range cell ∆R, azimuth beamwidth q, or elevation beamwidth g.
A study34 compared the resolving capability of three common detection proce - dures: linear detector with T A= +ˆ ˆµ σ , linear detector with T B=ˆµ, and log detector  with T C= + ˆµ, where the constants A, B, and C are used to obtain the same Pfa for  all detectors.
The estimates ˆµandˆσof m and s were obtained from either (1) all the  reference cells or (2) the leading or lagging half of the reference cells, choosing the  FIGURE 7.21  Modified generalized sign test processor ( after G.

The first simulation involved two targets separated by  1.5, 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 range cells and a third target 7.0 range cells from the first target.
 When the two closely spaced targets were well separated, either 2.5 or 3.0 range cells  apart, the probability of detecting both targets ( PD2) was < 0.05 for the linear detector  with T A= +ˆ ˆµ σ ; 0.15 < PD2 < 0.75 for the linear detector with T B=ˆµ; and PD2 > 0.9  for the log detector.
A second simulation, involving only two targets, investigated the  effect of target suppression on log video, and the results are summarized in Table 7.2.
 The maximum value of PD2 is obtained when both targets have an S/N of 20 dB.
If one  of the targets has a larger S/N than the other target, suppression occurs—either target 1  suppresses target 2 or vice versa.
Also, one notes an improved performance for a small  S/N (10 to 13 dB) when calculating the threshold using only the half of the reference  cells with the lower mean value.
The resolution capability of the log detector that uses  only the half of the reference cells with the lower mean is shown in Figure 7.22.
The  probability of resolving two, equal-amplitude targets does not rise above 0.9 until they  are separated in range by 2.5 pulse widths.
By assuming that the target is small with respect to the pulse width and that the pulse  shape is known, the resolution capability can be improved by fitting the known pulse  shape to the received data and comparing the residue square error with a threshold.35   If only one target is present, the residue should be only noise and hence should be  small.
If two or more targets are present, the residue will contain signal from the  remaining targets and should be large.
The results of resolving two targets with   S/N = 20 dB are shown in Figure 7.23.
These targets can be resolved at a resolu - tion probability of 0.9 with a false alarm probability of 0.01 at separations varying  between one-fourth and three-fourths of a pulse width, depending on the relative phase   difference between the two targets.
Moreover, this result can be improved further by  processing multiple pulses.
Automatic Detection Summary.
 When only 2 to 4 samples (pulses) are avail - able, a binary integrator should be used to avoid false alarms due to interference.
When  a moderate number of pulses (5 to 16) are available, a binary integrator or a mov - ing-window integrator should be used.
If the number of pulses is large (greater than  20), a batch processor should be used.
If the samples are independent, a one-param - eter (mean) threshold can be used.
If the samples are dependent, one can either use  Thresholding  TechniqueTarget  SeparationS/N of Target no.

For the purpose of  applying the previous discussions on noncoherent processing to coherent processing,  the integrated output in a range-doppler cell of the doppler processor for a single coher - ent processing interval (CPI) can be treated as a single noncoherent pulse.
Because  three ambiguous measurements (i.e., detections) are usually required to remove the  range and doppler ambiguities,36,37 4 to 8 CPIs may be transmitted, and hence, there  are usually 4 to 8 noncoherent pulses available for processing.
7.3 AUTOMATIC TRACKING A track represents the belief that a physical object or “target” is present and has actu - ally been detected by the radar.
An automatic radar tracking system forms a track when  enough radar detections are made in a believable enough pattern to indicate a target is  actually present (as opposed to a succession of false alarms) and when enough time has  passed to allow accurate calculation of the target’s kinematic state—usually position  and velocity.
Thus, the goal of tracking is to transform a (time-lapse) detection picture  (shown in Figure 7.24 a), consisting of target detections, false alarms, and clutter, into  a track picture (shown in Figure 7.24 b), consisting of tracks on real targets, occasional  false tracks, and occasional deviations of track position from true tar get positions.
Figures 7.24 a and 7.24 b also illustrate some of the challenges of automatic track - ing.
Detections are made on targets, but some detections are missing because of target  fades or multiple targets in the same resolution cell, whereas additional detections are  present due to clutter or noise.

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration  AUTOMATIC DETECTION, TRACKING, AND SENSOR INTEGRATION  7 .236x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 Automatic tracking can generally be divided into the five steps shown in Figure 7.25  and detailed here: 1.
Radar detection acceptance: accepting or rejecting detections for insertion into the  tracking process.
The purpose of this step is to control false track rates.
2.
Association of accepted detections with existing tracks.
3.
Updating existing tracks with associated detections.
4.
New track formation using unassociated detections.
5.
Radar scheduling and control.
The result of the automatic tracking process is a track file that contains a track state  for each target detected by the radar.
As shown in Figure 7.25, there is a feedback loop between all these functions so the  ability to update existing tracks accurately naturally affects the ability to associate detec - tions with existing tracks.
Also, the ability to correctly associate detections with existing  tracks affects the track’s accuracy and the ability to correctly distinguish between an exist - ing track and a new one.
The detection accept/reject step makes use of feedback from the  association function that measures the detection activity in different regions of the radar  coverage.
More stringent acceptance criteria are applied in more active regions.
Track File.
 When a track is established in the computer, it is assigned a track num - ber.
All parameters associated with a given track are referred to by this track number.
 Typical track parameters are the filtered and predicted position; velocity; acceleration  (when applicable); time of last update; track quality; signal-to-noise ratio; covariance  matrices (the covariance contains the accuracy of all the track coordinates and all the  statistical cross-correlations between them), if a Kalman-type filter is being used; and  FIGURE 7.24 b Thirty-minute time lapse of tracks formed from data   in Figure 7.24 a, using Global Nearest-Neighbor (GNN) Technique ( after   H.

Tracks and detections can be accessed in vari - ous sectored, linked-list, and other data structures so that the association process can  be performed efficiently.39 In addition to the track file, a clutter file is maintained.
A  clutter number is assigned to each stationary or very slowly moving echo.
All param - eters associated with a clutter point are referred to by this clutter number.
Again, each  clutter number is assigned to a sector in azimuth for efficient association.
Radar Detection Acceptance.
 When the radar system has either no or limited  coherent processing, not all the detections declared by the automatic detector are used  in the tracking process.
Rather, many of the detections (contacts) are filtered out in  software using a process called activity control.32,40 The basic idea is to use detection  signal characteristics in connection with a map of the detection activity to reduce the  rate of detections to one that is acceptable for forming tracks.
The map is constructed  by counting the unassociated detections (those that do not associate with existing  tracks) at the point in the track processing shown in Figure 7.25.
Counts are averaged over many revisits of the radar to achieve statistical signifi - cance.
The detection signal characteristics (such as amplitude or signal-to-noise) are  then re-thresholded to reduce sensitivity in regions of unacceptably high activity.
In  no circumstances are detections eliminated if they fall within a track gate (i.e., a gate  centered on the predicted position of a firm track).
Figure 7.26 illustrates an example  FIGURE 7.26 Histogram of detection signal-to noise ratio detection  illustrating the effectiveness of the activity control using the signal-to-noise  test in rain clutter.
Ungated contacts generally represent clutter.
Gated con - tacts generally represent targets.
Re-thresholding, in this case, successfully  eliminates large numbers of clutter detections while preserving most target  detections.

In this case, activity control effectively eliminates most of the  clutter detections without eliminating many of the actual target detections.
However,  because this process essentially constitutes controlled desensitization of the radar, it  must be used with care.
The mapping of the detection activity must be precise so that  desensitization occurs only in those regions requiring it.
Updating Existing Tracks with Associated Detections.
 The simplest method  of updating a track state is the a-b  filter41 described by  xs(k) = xp (k) + a [xm(k) − xp(k)] (7.19)  vs(k) = vs(k − 1) + b [xm(k) − xp(k)]/T (7.20)  xp(k + 1) = xs(k) + vs(k)T (7.21) where xs(k) is the filtered position, vs(k) is the filtered velocity, xp(k) is the predicted  position, xm(k) is the measured position, T is the time between detections, and ( a, b)  are the position and velocity gains, respectively.
The selection of ( a, b) is a design  tradeoff.
Small gains make a small correction in the direction of each detection.
As a  result, the tracking filter is less sensitive to noise but is more sluggish to respond to  maneuvers—deviation from the assumed target model.
Conversely, large gains pro - duce more tracking noise but quicker response to maneuvers.
These errors are readily  calculated as a function of a and b using the formulas shown in Table 7.3.
To tune the a-b filter for radar tracking, one uses the radar parameters to calculate  the tracking errors listed in Table 7.3 as a function of the tracking gains a and b.
 Then one selects the gains that best meet the needs of the application.
For example,  consider a radar that has 50-meter range measurement accuracy and a two-second  constant update interval.
The application of this radar system is to track a target that  moves linearly but with occasional unpredictable maneuvers of up to 1 g (9.8 m/s2).

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration  AUTOMATIC DETECTION, TRACKING, AND SENSOR INTEGRATION  7 .276x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 For simplicity, assume the Benedict-Bordner constant relationship41 [b  = a2/(2 - a)]  between a  and b.
The position accuracy of the filter can then be calculated using the formulas in  Table 7.3 and is shown in Figure 7.27.
When the target is nonmaneuvering, accuracy,  as measured by the standard deviation of the predicted tracking state, improves mono - tonically as the tracking gain a decreases to 0.
Conversely, when the target is per - forming the 1-g maneuver, accuracy, as measured by the lag (or bias) in the predicted  tracking state, improves monotonically as the tracking gain increases to 1.
The total  tracking error can be defined as the error that is exceeded only 1% of the time due to  the sum of random errors and bias.
The total range-tracking error is best in the region  0.6 < a < 0.9 with a minimum around 0.75.
If accuracy for maneuvers is the dominant  concern, then one would probably tune this filter to 0.75 to achieve the lowest total  error for a 1-g acceleration.
This same technique can be applied to many different  radar-tracking problems using the equations in Table 7.3 to calculate a graph such as  the one shown in Figure 7.27.
For simple tracking problems, the a-b   filter with constant gains selected for the appli-   cation will often be adequate.
However, more complex tracking problems require vari - able tracking gains (e.g., larger gains at the beginning of the track and larger gains after  missed detections or when the range to the track decreases, making angle noise less of  an issue).
A systematic method for calculating the gains depending on the situation is the  FIGURE 7.27  Example of the tuning of an a-b radar range-tracking filter by selecting the gain that mini - mizes total error (radar parameters: range accuracy, 50 meters; update interval, 2 seconds; target parameter,  1 g unknown acceleration; gain relation, [ b = a2/(2 - a)]) ch07.indd   27 12/17/07   2:14:00 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

The Kalman filter can be formulated for target motion  in one, two, or three dimensions in polar, Cartesian, or Earth-centered coordinates and  for three-dimensional, two-dimensional, or one-dimensional radar measurements.
For  simplicity, a three-dimensional tracking problem in Cartesian space with three measured  radar dimensions is considered here.
Target motion is described by  X(tk+1) = f(tk) X(tk) + A(tk) + Ap(tk) (7.22) where X(tk) is the target state at time tk, consisting of position and velocity components;  f(tk) is a transition matrix that moves the target linearly over an elapsed time, Tk = tk+1 − tk,  from time tk to time tk+1; A(tk) is the target state change due to an unknown acceleration  caused by a maneuver or atmospheric drag; and Ap(tk) is target state change due to a known  acceleration that can be corrected, such as gravity for a falling object or Coriollis accelera - tion.

The function h is the coordinate transform that relates the measurements to the  state at time tk according to the coordinate frame design choices (see Table 7.5, later in  the chapter).

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration 7 .30  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 using the Kalman gains  Kk+1 = P(k + 1 | k)HT(tk+1)[H(tk+1)P(k + 1 | k)HT(tk+1) + ℜk]−1 (7.33) Because the gains are calculated using the history of all past update times and  accuracies, the gains automatically increase after missed detections and automatically  increase to give greater weight to a detection when it is known to be more accurate,  and they automatically decrease as the track ages, reflecting the value of the detections  already filtered.
For example, for a zero random acceleration, Qk = 0, and a constant  detection covariance matrix, ℜk, the a – b filter can be made equivalent to the Kalman  filter by setting  α=− +2 2 1 1( ) ( )k k k (7.34) and  β=+6 1 k k( ) (7.35) on the kth scan.
Thus, as time passes, a and b approach zero, applying heavy filtering  to the new samples.
In practical radar applications Qk > 0, and so the tracking gains  eventually settle to a non-zero value termed the steady-state tracking gains.
The tradeoffs for employing a Kalman filter for radar tracking generally are tuning  the filter for the desired degree of filtering, selecting the tracking coordinates, and  adapting the filter to deal with changes in the target motion (e.g., maneuvers, different  phases of ballistic flight, and so on).
Tuning the Kalman Filter.
 The greatest advantage of the Kalman filter for radar  tracking is that it provides a systematic way of calculating gains.
However, a disadvan - tage is that this gain calculation assumes linear target motion with random perturba - tions (Eq.
7.22).
Most practical radar-tracking problems involve targets that deviate  from linear motion in more complex ways (e.g., course corrections, terrain following,  evasive maneuvers, and atmospheric drag).
The Kalman filter is tuned to a practical  radar-tracking problem through the selection of the covariance matrix, Q(tk), of the  unknown random maneuver.
The goal of this selection is to obtain the best possible  tracking performance for the more complex cases of interest while still using the sim - ple Kalman random perturbation model.
For example, in the simplified case of a single  dimension and constant tracking conditions, the measurement covariance matrix is  simply a single, constant measurement variance, ℜk = s�2 m, and the time between detec - tions is a constant Rk = T.
In this case, the Kalman filter described in Eqs.
7.29 to 7.33  has gains that are a function of the dimensionless track-filtering parameter gtrack:  γσtrack=qT m3 2  (7.36) Because the radar measurement accuracy, as represented by the covariance matrix  ℜ, and the time between detection opportunities, T, are parameters of the radar design  itself, the selection of Q(tk) is the degree of freedom available to the tracking filter  design.
Table 7.4 summarizes the methods for tuning the Kalman filter.

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration  AUTOMATIC DETECTION, TRACKING, AND SENSOR INTEGRATION  7 .336x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 As seen in Figure 7.28, the selection of Q(tk) and thus gtrack allows one to uniquely  determine the steady-state tracking gains as a function of gtrack.
One can see that  large assumed maneuvers (large q, aa, or a); larger time between updates, T; or very  accurate radar measurements (small ℜ) will result in large tracking gains.

For random changes in velocity at  each measurement interval (model no.
3), the gains increase to ( a, b)  = (1,1), which  is very conservative from a filter stability point of view.
For white noise acceleration  sampled by radar measurements (model no.
1), the gains are a compromise, increasing  to ( , ) ( ,( )) α β = −1 3 3.
Because this model is a sampled continuous time acceleration,  it is preferred when update times are variable because the target does not maneuver  more or less when the update interval changes.
The equations in Table 7.3 can then be used to calculate the filter performance in  terms of variance reduction ratios and tracking lags.
Adjustments to parameters of gtrack  can be made to obtain the desired noise and lag tradeoff.
Selection of Tracking Coordinates.
 The Kalman filter assumes linear target  motion and a linear relation between the radar detections and the target coordinates.
 However, radars make detections in polar coordinates (range, angle, doppler), while  target motion is most likely linear in Cartesian coordinates ( x, y, z).
Therefore, some  compromises must generally be made in selecting a coordinate system for filtering.
 Table 7.5 describes the design tradeoffs for different selections.
The polar Kalman filter is rarely used because of the pseudo-accelerations intro - duced by propagating the state in polar coordinates.
The Cartesian/Earth-centered  Kalman filter can work well but may have difficulty accommodating radar measure - ments of less than three dimensions.
The extended/dual coordinate system Kalman  filter prevents pseudo-accelerations and accommodates measurements of any dimen - sionality.
Both the Cartesian/Earth-centered Kalman filters involve nonlinear transfor - mations resulting in an imperfect calculation of the tracking accuracy.
When prediction  times are long and/or when very accurate results are needed, these imperfections in  the Kalman filter covariance calculation can be significant, and the tracking errors can  be quite non-gaussian.
Particle filters typically propagate a large number of random  samples (particles) from a state transition prior distribution to estimate posterior dis - tributions that are not required to be gaussian in form.
Thus, in a particle filter, even  multi-modal distributions can be used as prior and realized as posterior distributions.
 However, particle filters require quite a bit of computation.
The unscented Kalman filter55 more efficiently calculates the tracking accuracy by  propagating selected cardinal points through the filter.
The unscented Kalman Filter  approximates the covariance matrix with a set of 2 L + 1 sample points, where L is the  number of state dimensions.
The sample points are propagated through an arbitrary  transform function and then used to reconstruct a gaussian covariance matrix.
This  technique has the advantage of representing the covariance accurately to the third  order of a Taylor series expansion.
As a result, the calculated tracking accuracy is (at  least to third order) uncontaminated (or “unscented”) by the nonlinearity .
Adapting Filter to Deal with Changes in Target Motion.
 The Kalman filter  assumes linear target motion perturbed by a random maneuver model as a mathemati - cal convenience in calculating tracking gains.
However, most radar targets do not  move in a random maneuver but instead move linearly at times and then maneuver  unpredictably at times.
The challenge in adapting the filter to deal with changes in the  target motion (e.g., maneuvers, ballistic re-entry) is to adapt the target motion model  for the Kalman filter over time so that more accurate tracking occurs than with a single  model.
The simplest form of adaptation is a maneuver detector to monitor the tracking  filter residuals (differences between measured and predicted position).

Upon  maneuver detection, the maneuver spectral density, q, is increased in the Kalman filter  model, resulting in higher tracking gains and better following of the maneuver .
A more complex approach is to use multiple Kalman filters running simultaneously  with different target motion models—generally, different q values or different equa - tions for target motion (e.g., constant acceleration or constant velocity).
Figure 7.29  shows a bank of multiple parallel filters all fed by the same stream of associated mea - surements.
At each detection time, tk, one of the several filter outputs must be selected  to be the track state used for detection to track association.
A systematic way of employing multiple target motion models is the Interacting  Multiple Model (IMM) approach diagrammed in Figure 7.30.56 Multiple models run  simultaneously; however, they do not run independently.

The update equation for the ith model depends not only on the ith  model state but also on the states of all other models.
These states are mixed using  inferred probabilities of the target transitioning from one motion model to another.
As an example, consider radar tracking of a ballistic missile that undergoes distinct  phases of flight: boost, exo-atmospheric flight, and endo-atmospheric re-entry.
Each of  these phases of flight has a distinct target model.57 During boost, the target is continually  accelerating and increasing speed.
This acceleration is unknown and must be estimated.
 During exo-atmospheric flight, the object is falling with the known acceleration of  gravity.
During endo-atmospheric re-entry, the target continues to fall but experiences a  drag acceleration due to its ballistic coefficient (an unknown target parameter related to  the shape and mass of the target).
An IMM filter can be used to systematically transition  between these different phases of flight, providing a single filter output.
Figure 7.31  shows the model probabilities for such an IMM filter application.

 The goal of detection- to-track association is to correctly assign radar detections to existing tracks so the track  states in the track file can be correctly updated.
The basis for assignment is a measure of  how close together the detection and track are in terms of measurable parameters such  as range, angle, doppler, and, when available, target signature.
The statistical distance  is calculated as a weighted combination of the available detection-to-track coordinate  differences.
In the most general case, this is a complex quadratic form:  D Y h X t t H t P k k H tk k k kT 2 1 1 1 1 = − ++∧ + + ( ( ( | ))[( ) ( | ) (k k k k k kTR Y h X t t+− + +∧ + −11 1 1 ) ] ( ( ( | ))     (7.37) For most single radar-tracking problems, it reduces to a simple weighted sum  Dr rm p rm p pm p 22 2 22 2 2=− ++− ++− ( ) ( ) ( σ σθ θ σ σϕ ϕ θ θ pr) ) ( )2 2 22 2 2σ σ σ σϕ ϕ++− +pm p DD D pD (7.38) where ( rm, qm, jm, Dm) are the measured range, azimuth, elevation, and doppler with  accuracies ( sr, sq, sj, sD); (rp, qp, jp, Dp) are the range, azimuth, elevation, and dop - pler predicted by the automatic tracker with accuracies ( spr, spq, spj, spD).
The pre - dicted accuracies are a byproduct of the radar tracking filter.
Statistical distance rather  than Euclidean distance must be used because the range accuracy is usually much  better than the azimuth accuracy.
When targets are widely spaced and in a clear environment, only one target detection  pair has a small D2, making these assignments obvious.
Thus, the design of detection-to- track association is usually dominated by the more difficult conditions of closely spaced  targets or closely spaced targets and clutter.
Figure 7.32 shows a common situation for  closely spaced targets and/or clutter.
Three association gates are constructed around the  predicted positions of three existing tracks.
Three detections are made, but assignment of  the detections to the tracks is not obvious: two detections are within gate 1; three detec - tions are within gate 2; and one detection is within gate 3.

If  the detection is outside the track gate, the statistical distance is set to infinity.
Nearest-neighbor assignment is the most common solution to this problem.
The  simplest form of nearest neighbor works sequentially on incoming data.
As each new  detection is made, it is assigned to the track with which it has the smallest statistical  distance.
Hence, if detection no.
9 was received first, it would be assigned to track no.
 2.
However, it is better to delay the association process slightly so that all detections in  a local neighborhood are received and stored and an association table, such as Table 7.6,  generated.
(This has implications about how sectors are scanned with a phased array.) Nearest-neighbor assignment can now be applied to the association table by finding  the smallest statistical distance between a detection and a track, making that associa - tion, and eliminating that detection and track (row and column) from the table.
This  process is repeated until there are either no tracks or no detections left.
Applying this  algorithm to Table 7.6 results in detection no.

Performing this optimization can  be done using Munkres algorithm.58 Munkres algorithm is an exact solution of  the minimization problem but is rarely used because it is computationally slow.
A  more computationally efficient exact solution is the Jonker, V olgenant, Castanon  (JVC) algorithm.59 The JVC is much more efficient for sparse assignment matrices  (which are likely for practical radar-tracking problems).
Speed improvements of   30 to 1000 times have been reported.
An effective suboptimal solution is the Auction  algorithm, which views the tracks as being “auctioned off” to the detections—   iteratively assigning higher costs to tracks competed for by more detections.60   Figure 7.33 provides a comparison61 of the Munkres, JVC, and Auction algorithms  optimized for sparse data.
The JVC and Auction algorithms provide a significant  increase in computational speed.
Although the Auction algorithm is simpler, requir - ing less lines of code, the JVC algorithm generally requires less computation time.
2.
Probabilistic Data Association (PDA)  Another alternative is the probabilistic  data association (PDA) algorithm62,63,64 where no attempt is made to assign tracks  to detections, but instead, tracks are updated with all the nearby detections— weighted by the perceived probability of the track being the correct association.
 Because PDA relies on erroneous associations essentially “averaging out,” it is  most effective when tracks are far enough apart that nearby detections originate  from spatially random noise or clutter exclusively and when the tracking gains  are small (i.e., when the tracking index gtrack is small).

Multiple Hypothesis Algorithms  The most sophisticated algorithms are multiple  hypothesis algorithms in which all (or many) possible tracks are formed and updated  with each possible detection.66,67,68 In Table 7.6, track no.
1 would become three  tracks (or hypotheses), corresponding to updating with detection no.
8, detection  no.
7, and no detection.
Each of these tracks would undergo a Kalman filter update  and be eligible for association with the next set of detections.
Tracks are pruned  away in a systematic manner leaving only the most probable.
Figure 7.34 illus - trates the tracking of a single target using multiple hypothesis techniques.
In this  example, many hypotheses are formed and, over successive measurement intervals,  successfully pruned away leaving only one correct track.
The region of applicability for the more sophisticated algorithms is determined by two  parameters: the density of extraneous detections l (detections per unit area or volume)   FIGURE 7.33  A comparison of the execution time for  the Munkres (optimum), JVC (optimum), and Auction  (suboptimum) algorithms shows the rapid increase in  computation required for Munkres as the number of  rows in the assignment matrix increases.

Figure 7.35 bounds this region  of applicability.
When l and gtrack are small, then there is no need for any more than  simple nearest neighbor tracking, and indeed, most tracking systems still use this  approach.
As l increases, there is greater risk of false association decisions; however,  the effect of this is reduced if gtrack is small.
At the other extreme, when l and gtrack are  large, the tracking problem is essentially unsolvable without basic changes to the radar  design parameters to reduce them.
There is an intermediate region where sophisticated  association has value.
The width of this region is very specific to the particular prob - lem.
When gtrack is large and very little delay in the output can be tolerated, then the  region of applicability is fairly small and very simple multiple hypothesis approaches  (splitting tracks into at most one or two hypotheses) are then the best answer .
When gtrack is small, then PDA/JPDA can be used to operate at significantly higher  false alarm densities.
When significant delay can be tolerated in the output, then many  hypotheses can be formed (as in Figure 7.34) and orders of magnitude more detections  handled.
Blackman and Popoli44 provide a good survey of comparative studies in this  area.
One study using data recorded from flights of closely spaced aircraft showed  very little difference between GNN, JPDA, and MHT.38 However, theoretical predic - tions can show differences of orders of magnitude in the density of clutter detections  that can be handled.44 New Track Formation .
There are two classes of track formation algorithms: 1.
Forward-tracking  algorithms  basically propagate one hypothesis forward in time,  recursively checking for “target-like” motion.
Detections that do not correlate with  clutter points or tracks are used to initiate new tracks.
If the detection does not  contain doppler information, the new detection is usually used as the predicted  position (in some military systems, one assumes a radially inbound velocity), and  a large correlation region must be used for the next observation.
The correlation  region must be large enough to capture the next detection of the target, assuming  that it could have the maximum velocity of interest.

 However, one may require a much larger number of detections when the radar has  the flexibility of an electronic scan that can place many detection opportunities in  a short time interval.
2.
Backward-tracking or “batch” algorithms  consider all the detections simultane - ously, attempting to match the detections to a “target-like” pattern.
This can be done  by actually constructing a large number of matched filters, as in retrospective pro - cessing71 (see Figure 7.36), or by using a forward-tracking process with multiple  hypothesis formed and propagated.
Just as automatic radar detection is a tradeoff between probability of detection  and probability of false alarm, new track formation is a tradeoff between the speed at  which a track is formed and the probability of erroneously forming a false track that  does not represent a physical object of interest.
There are two types of false tracks:  (1) Tracks on real objects that are simply not of interest.
For example, if the targets of  interest are airplanes, then a false track could be a track on a bird.
(2) Tracks composed  of unrelated detections from different objects that the automatic tracking process has  mistakenly associated together.
For example, a false track could be composed of detec - tions from several different stationary clutter points that have been associated together  over time to create a false moving track.
The approach for preventing false tracks on objects not of interest is to actually  develop tracks on all of them but then observe them long enough to classify them as  unwanted.
In the case of the bird, one would gather enough detections to improve the  velocity accuracy of the track so that it is clear whether the track is of interest or not.
 Thus, one desires to delay the disclosure of a track until enough time has passed to  classify it accurately.
This accuracy can be determined by Tobs, the amount of time over  which the object is observed and by basic parameters of the radar: T = the time between successive detections s  = the accuracy in a particular dimension of interest M = the number of detections used in forming the track N ≅ (Tobs / T ) + 1, which is the number of detection opportunities The velocity accuracy is given by the following equation:72  σσ vTN N N= ×− +  obs12 1 11 2( ) ( )/  (7.39) The dominant design parameters in the equation are the accuracy of the radar and  the observation time.
(Better accuracy or longer observation time allows more accurate  measurement of velocity.) Making more detections in the observation time improves  the accuracy but only in a square-root sense.
The approach to preventing falsely composed tracks from different objects in a  clutter region, G, is to require enough detections in a tight enough pattern to make  E[NFT], the expected number of false tracks, small.

Forward- and  backward-tracking algorithms produce similar numbers of false tracks.
However,  the backward-tracking algorithms can operate in more ambiguous situations (where  the density of false alarms, l, is comparable to or greater than lF or lP).
Under these  ambiguous circumstances, the forward tracker will have multiple detections in a  track formation or promotion gate and will require multiple hypothesis to reliably  form tracks.
The design of the track formation process and the automatic detection process  should be considered together.
A longer time allowed for track formation (higher  M/N) allows the radar detection process to use lower detection thresholds, result - ing in better radar sensitivity.
For any given set of radar parameters, M/N track  formation criterion, and probability distribution of clutter amplitudes, there exists  an optimum false-alarm rate that minimizes the signal-to-noise ratio required to  detect targets.
Figure 7.38 illustrates this optimization for an eight-scan track for - mation process.

 However, if a longer delay is tolerable, then detection thresholds can be lower, result - ing in better sensitivity in non-gaussian clutter.
Radar Scheduling and Control.
 The interaction of the radar-tracking system  with the scheduling and control function of the radar is minor for mechanical rotating  radars but major for phased array radars.
For mechanically rotating radars, all that is  usually done is that the tracking gates are fed back to the signal processor.
The tracking  gates are always used to facilitate the association process and may be used to lower  the detection threshold within the gate and/or modify the contact entry logic within the  gate (e.g., modify rules governing clutter maps).
The interaction of the tracking system with a phased array radar is much more sig - nificant.
The major benefit of a phased array with respect to tracking is in the area of  track initiation.75,76 Phased arrays use a confirmation strategy to initiate tracks rapidly.
 That is, after the association process, all unassociated detections generate confirmation  dwells to confirm the existence of a new track.
The initial confirmation dwell uses the  same waveform (frequency and PRF, if a pulse-doppler waveform) but may increase the  energy.
Analysis has shown that a 3-dB increase in the transmitted confirmation energy  (additional energy is also available by placing the target in the center of the confirma - tion beam) can significantly increase the probability of confirmation.76 Furthermore,  the confirmation dwell should be transmitted as soon as possible to maintain a Swerling   I fluctuation model.
(That is, if the target was originally detected when the target fluc - tuation produced a large return, the confirmation dwell will see this same large return.)  After confirmation, a series of initial track maintenance dwells over several seconds is  used to develop an accurate state vector.
A complete discussion of priority associated  with tracking within the scheduler of a phased array is beyond the scope of this brief  discussion.
However, it is worthwhile noting these general rules: (1) Confirmation dwells  should have a priority higher than all other functions except those associated with weapon   control; (2) low priority tracks (e.g., tracks at long range) can be updated using search  detections; and (3) high priority tracks should have a priority higher than volume surveil - lance.
The update rate for high priority tracks should be such that a single tracking dwell is  sufficient to update the track.
The actual update rate will depend on many factors includ - ing (a) maximum target speed and maneuver capability, (b) radar beamwidth (beam could  be spoiled), (c) range of the radar track, and (d) accuracy of predicted position.
If a pulse  doppler dwell is required to update the track in clutter, the waveform should be selected to  place the target near the center of the ambiguous range-doppler detection space.
Finally,  the track can be updated with the ambiguous range-doppler detection because the track  state-vector can be used to remove the ambiguity.
7.4 NETWORKED RADARS Ideally, a single radar can reliably detect and track all targets of interest.
However, the  environment and the laws of physics often will not permit this.
In general, no single  radar can provide a complete surveillance and tracking picture.
Radar networking can  be a good solution to this problem and, in some cases, may be more cost effective than  solving the problem through one very high performance radar.
Radar networking systems  are generally characterized by what radar data are shared and how they are correlated  and fused.
The two most common ways of combining radar data are as follows: ch07.indd   46 12/17/07   2:14:56 PMDownloaded from Digital Engineering Library @ McGraw-Hill (www.digitalengineeringlibrary.com) Copyright © 2008 The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Detection-to-track fusion (see Figure 7.39, upper half) associates each detection to  the networked track, calculated potentially using detections from all radars.
Thus,  the entire stream of detections (up to the present) is potentially available to calcu - late the track state used for the association decision on the most recent detection.
2.
Track-to-track fusion (see Figure 7.39, lower half) associates each detection to a  single radar track state calculated using only detections from that radar.
The single  radar track states are then grouped with each other to produce a netted track state.
The design decision as to which approach is better for grouping data depends on the  radars and targets involved.
One case where detection-to-track association is clearly bet - ter is when the radars have a reduced probability of detection so there are potential gaps  in the data stream or periods where the data stream is sparse.
In these cases, a much more  accurate track state can be calculated using multiple data streams than using only one  because multiple streams will tend to fill in the gaps in detection and restore a high con - sistent data rate during periods of reduced probability of detection.
Figure 7.40 illustrates  the sensitivity to target fades by plotting the track region of uncertainty (ROU) versus the  probability of detection for single radar tracking and multiple radar tracking.
The ROU is  defined as the distance that contains the error with 99 percent probability and is ROU = 2.3(tracking error due to detection noise ) + (tracking error due to maneuver ) This can be calculated for any case of interest using the formulas in Table 7.3.

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration 7 .48  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 When the probability of detection is much less than unity, the measurement-to-track  fusion is considerably more accurate.
This is easily explained by the fact that the prob - ability of a significant outage of data is much reduced if two sources are available.
With  a more accurate track, tighter association criteria can be used for detections.
If the biases cannot be effectively removed, then there may be an advantage to asso - ciating to a single radar track—which by definition is unbiased with respect to itself.
 If biases cannot be kept smaller than the ROU, then at high probabilities of detection,  one prefers single radar association followed by track-to-track association.
It is possible to make simple comparisons between the accuracy of detection fusion  as opposed to track fusion for equivalent use of data bandwidth to exchange radar data.
 When ROU is plotted as a function of the position gain a, it has the “bathtub” shape  shown by the single radar curve in Figure 7.41.
The left-hand side of the “bathtub” is  dominated by the lag component, while the right-hand side is dominated by the radar  measurement noise component.
Because the gains (horizontal axis) are the designer’s  choice, the single radar ROU is the minimum of the “bathtub” curve.
Now consider the fusion of two radars in a particular dimension.
If one radar has one- tenth the ROU of the other in this dimension, then the more accurate radar in this dimension  will dominate and essentially determine the result.
At least in steady state, it is relatively  easy to produce this dominance by any of the fusion methods.
Of more interest is the case  where the radars are comparable in terms of accuracy and update rate, producing compa - rable ROUs.
This case more clearly shows the difference in the fusion methods.
For example, when two identical radars are combined by detection fusion, then  the update rate is essentially doubled.
This reduces the lag by a factor of 4, allowing a  smaller gain to be selected (optimization more to the left of the “bathtub”), reducing  the tracking errors due to measurement noise.
The net result is the movement from the  single radar curve to the detection fusion curve in Figure 7.41.
FIGURE 7.40  Comparison of detection-to-track and track-to-track association.
For fad - ing targets ( Pd < 1), detection-to-track is preferred.
For large sensor biases and non-fading  targets, track-to-track is preferred.

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration  AUTOMATIC DETECTION, TRACKING, AND SENSOR INTEGRATION  7 .496x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 When two identical radars are combined by track fusion, the update rate for each  tracking process does not change, and so the lag does not change.
However, the stan - dard deviation of the tracking errors due to measurement noise is reduced by the square  root of 2, allowing a larger gain to be selected (optimization more to the right of the  bathtub), reducing the lag.
The net result is the movement from the single radar curve  to the track fusion curve in Figure 7.41.
If there is any significant maneuver possible, the factor of 4 in lag will have a more  significant effect than the factor of the square root of 2 in the square root of the tracking  errors due to measurement noise.
Thus, one can see the detection fusion curve achieves  a significantly lower minimum than the track fusion curve.
To combine data from multiple radars, the data must be placed in a common coor - dinate system.
This process is called grid locking  and involves specifying the location  of the radars and estimating radar biases in range and angle.
The previous difficult  problem of radar location is solved trivially by the global positioning system.
An esti - mate of radar biases between two radars can be obtained from a long-term average of  the difference between predicted and measured coordinates on all tracks that have a  substantial number of detections from both radars.78 7.5 UNLIKE-SENSOR INTEGRATION A number of sensors can be integrated: radar, identification friend or foe (IFF), the  air traffic control radar beacon system (ATCRBS), infrared, optical, and acoustic.
The  sensors that are most easily integrated are the electromagnetic sensors, i.e., radar, IFF,  and strobe extractors of noise sources or emitters.

The problem of integrating radar and military IFF data is less  difficult than that of integrating two radars.
The question of whether detections or  tracks should be integrated is a function of the application.
In a military situation, by  integrating detections one could interrogate the target only a few times, identify it,  and then associate it with a radar track.
From then on, there would be little need for  re-interrogating the target.
However, in an air traffic control situation using ATCRBS,  targets would be interrogated at every scan and, consequently, either detections or  tracks could be integrated.
Radar–DF Bearing Strobe Integration.
 Correlating radar tracks with DF  (direction finding) bearing strobes on emitters has been considered by Coleman79 and  later by Trunk and Wilson.80,81 Trunk and Wilson considered the problem of associ - ating each DF track with either no radar track or one of m radar tracks.
In their for - mulation, there were K DF angle tracks, each specified by a different number of DF  detections; and similarly, m radar tracks, each specified by a different number of radar  detections.
Because each target can carry multiple emitters (i.e., multiple DF tracks  can be associated with each radar track), each DF track association can be considered  by itself, resulting in K disjoint association problems.
Consequently, an equivalent  problem is given a DF track specified by n DF bearing detections, one can associate  the DF track with no radar track or with one of m radar tracks, the jth radar track being  specified by mj radar detections.
Using a combination of Bayes and Neyman-Pearson  procedures and assuming that the DF detection errors are usually independent and  gaussian-distributed with zero mean and constant variance s2 but with occasional out - liers (i.e., large errors not described by the gaussian density), Trunk and Wilson argued  that the decision should be based on the probability  Pj = probability ( Z ≥ dj) (7.44) where Z has a chi-square density with nj degrees of freedom and dj is given by  d t t jj in e i j ij = − = =∑ 12 24 1 min{ ,[ ( ) ( )]/ } ,.
.
., θ θ σ m m  (7.45) where nj is the number of DF detections overlapping the time interval for which the  jth radar track exists; qe(ti) is the DF detection at time ti; qj(ti) is the predicted azimuth  of radar track j for time ti; and the factor 4 limits the square error to 4 s2 to account for  DF outliers.
By using the two largest Pjs, designated Pmax and Pnext, and thresholds  TL, TH, TM, and R, the following decisions and decision rules were generated: 1.
Firm correlation  DF signal goes with radar track having largest Pj (i.e., Pmax)  when Pmax ≥ TH and Pmax ≥ Pnext + R.
2.
Tentative correlation  DF signal probably goes with radar track having largest Pj  (i.e., Pmax) when TH > Pmax ≥ TM and Pmax ≥ Pnext + R.
3.
Tentative correlation with some track  DF signal probably goes with some radar  track (but cannot determine which) when Pmax ≥ TM but Pmax < Pnext + R.
4.
Tentatively uncorrelated  DF signal probably does not go with any radar track  when TM > Pmax > TL.
5.
Firmly uncorrelated DF signal does not go with any radar track when TL ≥ Pmax.

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration  AUTOMATIC DETECTION, TRACKING, AND SENSOR INTEGRATION  7 .516x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 The lower threshold TL determines the probability that the correct radar track (i.e.,  the one associated with the DF signal) will be incorrectly rejected from further consid - eration.
If the desired rejection rate for the correct track is PR, one can obtain this by  setting TL = PR.
The threshold TH is set equal to Pfa, defined as the probability of falsely  associating a radar track with a DF signal when the DF signal does not belong with  the radar track.
The threshold TH is a function of the azimuth difference m between the  true (DF) position and the radar track under consideration.
The threshold TH was found  for m = 1.0s and m = 1.5s by simulation techniques, and the results for Pfa = 0.01 are  shown in Figure 7.42.
Between the high and low thresholds, there is a tentative region.
 The middle threshold divides the “tentative” region into a tentatively correlated region  and a tentatively uncorrelated region.
The rationale in setting the threshold is to set the  two associated error probabilities equal for a particular separation.
The threshold TM  was found by using simulation techniques and is also shown in Figure 7.42.
The probability margin R ensures the selection of the proper DF radar association  (avoiding rapidly changing decisions) when there are two or more radar tracks close  to one another.
The correct selection is reached by postponing a decision until the two  highest association probabilities differ by R.
The value for R is found by specifying a  probability of an association error Pe according to Pe = P (Pmax ≥ Pnext + R), where  Pmax corresponds to an incorrect association and Pnext corresponds to the correct  association.
The probability margin R is a function of Pe and the separation m of the  radar tracks.
The probability margin R was found for m = 0.25s, 0.50s, and 1.00 s by  using simulation techniques, and the results for Pe = 0.01 are shown in Figure 7.43.

Automatic Detection, Tracking, and Sensor Integration 7 .52  RADAR HANDBOOK 6x9 Handbook  / Radar Handbook / Skolnik / 148547-3 / Chapter 7 Because the curves cross one another, one can ensure that Pe ≤ 0.01 for any m by setting  R equal to the maximum value of any curve for each value of n.
The algorithm was evaluated by using simulations and recorded data.
When the  radar tracks are separated by several standard deviations of the detection error, cor - rect decisions are made rapidly.
However, if the radar tracks are close to one another,  errors are avoided by postponing the decision until sufficient data are accumulated.
An  interesting example with recorded data is shown in Figures 7.44 and 7.45.
Figure 7.44  shows the radar (azimuth) detections of the control aircraft, the radar detections of four  aircraft of opportunity in the vicinity of the control aircraft, and the DF detections on  the radar on the control aircraft.
The association probabilities, with and without limit - ing in Eq.
7.45, are shown in Figure 7.45.
Initially, an aircraft of opportunity has the  highest association probability; however, a firm decision is not made because Pmax  does not exceed Pnext by the probability margin.
After the 14th DF detection, the  emitter is firmly correlated with the control aircraft.
However, at the 18th DF detec - tion, a very bad detection (outlier) is made, and the firm correlation is downgraded  to a tentative correlation if limiting is not used.
If limiting is employed, however, the  correct decision remains firm.
In a complex environment where there are many radar tracks and DF signal sources,  it is quite possible that many DF signals will be assigned the category that the DF  signal probably goes with some radar track.
To remove many of these ambiguities,  multisite DF operation can be considered.
The extension of the previous procedures  FIGURE 7.43  Probability margin versus number of DF detections for  three different target separations.
The os, xs, and ∆s are the simulation  results for m = 0.25, m = 0.5, and m = 1.0, respectively.
