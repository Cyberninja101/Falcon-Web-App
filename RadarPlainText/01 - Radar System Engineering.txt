Because this basic material may beofgreat value toscience and engineering, itseemed most important topublish itassoon assecurity permitted.
The Radiation Laboratory ofMIT, which operated under the super- vision oftheNational Defense Research Committee, undertook thegreat task ofpreparing these volumes.
The work described herein, however, is the collective result ofwork done atmany laboratories, Army, Navy, university, and industrial, both inthis country and inEngland, Canada, and other Dominions.
The Radiation Laboratory, once itsproposals were approved and finances provided bytheOffice ofScientific Research and Development, chose Louis N.Ridenour asEditor-in-Chief tolead and direct theentire project.
Aneditorial staff was then selected ofthose best qualified for thistype oftask.
Finally theauthors forthevarious volumes orchapters orsections were chosen from among those experts who were intimately familiar with the various fields, ,and who were able and willing towrite thesummaries ofthem.
This entire staff agreed toremain atwork at MIT forsixmonths ormore after thework oftheRadiation Laboratory was complete.
These volumes stand asamonument tothis group.
These volumes serve asamemorial tothe unnamed hundreds and thousands ofother scientists, engineers, and others who actually carried ontheresearch, development, and engineering work theresults ofwhich areherein described.
There were somany involved inthis work and they worked soclosely together even though often inwidely separated labora- tories that itisimpossible toname oreven toknow those who contributed toaparticular idea ordevelopment.
Only certain ones who wrote reports orarticles have even been mentioned.
But toallthose who contributed inany way tothis great cooperative development enterprise, both inthis country and inEngland, these volumes arededicated.

Yii  Preface THEearliest plans fortheRadiation Laboratory Series, made inthefall of1944, envisaged only books concerned with the basic microwave and electronic theory and techniques that had been sothoroughly devel- oped during thewartime work onradar.
These plans were laid aside for atime when itbecame clear inthis country that several months offighting remained intheEuropean war.
When work ontheSeries was resumed intheearly summer of1945, the books planned, asbefore, dealt with basic matters and with techniques.
Every effort was made topoint outthegeneral applicability ofthework reported and toavoid special emphasis onitsapplication toradar, since radar itself was thought tohave only alimited importance.
The end ofthePacific war made itpossible toput more effort onthe jobofpreparing the Series than had been available earlier.
The books ontheory and techniques having been planned ascomprehensively as appeared tobeworth while, the work was extended bythe addition of five books concerned with radar and allied systems.
Ofthose five books, this isthe only one that deals with radar itself.
One book takes uptheuseofradar innavigation, one concerns thedesign ofradar scanners and radomes, one treats thedesign and construction of beacons, and onedescribes hyperbolic navigational systems—in particular Loran.
This book isintended toserve asageneral treatise and reference book onthedesign ofradar systems.
Noapology seems tobeneeded forthe fact that itdeals primarily-though bynomeans altogether-with micro- wave pulse radar.
Thousands oftimes asmuch work hasgone into pulse radar asinto any other kind, and theoverwhehning majority ofthis work has been concerned with microwave pulse radar.
The superiority of microwaves foralmost allradar purposes isnow clear.
The first eight chapters ofthis book areintended toprovide anintro- duction tothefield ofradar and ageneral approach tothe problems of system design.
Chapters 9through 14take upthe leading design con- siderations forthevarious important components that make uparadar set.
These chapters aresothorough intheir treatment that Chap.
15, which gives two fairly detailed examples ofactual system design, can be quite brief.
Chapters 16and 17take uptwo new and important ancillary ix x PREFACE techniques that arenot dealt with fully elsewhere intheSeries: moving- target indication and the transmission ofradar displays toaremote indicator byradio means.
For fuller information than can befound inthis book onany detailed point ofdesign, the reader isreferred toone ofthe other books ofthe Series.
Inasense, this book specializes toradar thetechniques repotied more fully elsewhere intheSeries.
Radar isavery simple subject, and nospecial mathematical, physical, orengineering background isneeded toread and understand this book.
Because the book covers the entire field ofeffort ofthe Radiation Laboratory and theother wartime radar establishments, itscontributing authors aremore numerous than those listed formost other volumes of this series.
Iam especially grateful toL.J.Haworth and toE.M.
Purcell, whose contributions have been more extensive than those of other authors, and whose advice oneditorial problems has often been extremely helpful.
Inaddition tothe authors already listed, whose names appear inthe book inconnection with the material they have written, Iwish tothank the following men fortheir work inprovid- ing essential background material that did not eventually find itsway into the book: R.M.Alexander, A.H.Brown, J.F.Carlson, M.A.
Chaffee, L.M.Hollingsworth, E.L.Hudspeth, R.C.Spencer, and I.G.
Swope.
Changing plans forthe book also reduced the acknowledged contribution ofE.C.Pollard farbelow thevery considerable quantity of material heprepared.
Iowe anapology toallthe authors forthe liberty Ihave often taken inaltering their original text tofitthe final framework ofthe book and myown ideas ofstyle.
Because most authors lefttheLabora- tory immediately onfinishing their writing, and much ofthe editorial work had tobedeferred until thebook was substantially complete, ithas notalways been possible toadjust with theauthors thealterations intheir manuscripts that have seemed desirable tome.
The general acknowledgments Iowe asEditor-in-Chief oftheSeries are setforth inthe Series Index.
Inconnection with the preparation ofthis book, however, itisapleasure tothank Dr.
B.~.Bowden, ofthe British AirCommission, notonly forhisassistance asanauthor but also for his general comments onthe book asawhole.
Iam grateful to Lois Capen forherwork infollowing thepreparation ofillustrations, and toPhyllis Brown forgeneral secretarial assistance.

737 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION BYLOUIS N.RIDENOUR 101.
What Radar Does.
—Radar isanaddition toman’s sensory equipment which affords genuinely new facilities.
Itenables acertain class ofobjects tobe“seen” —that is,detected andlocated—at distances farbeyond those atwhich they could bedistinguished bythe unaided eye.
This ‘(seeing” isunimpaired bynight, fog, cloud, smoke, and most other obstacles toordinary vision.
Radar further permits the measure- ment oftherange oftheobjects it“sees” (this verb will hereafter beused without apologetic quotation marks) with aconvenience and precision entirely unknown inthe past.
Itcan also measure the instantaneous speed ofsuch anobject toward oraway from the observing station ina simple and natural way.
The superiority ofradar toordinary vision lies, then, inthe greater distances atwhich seeing ispossible with radar, intheability ofradar to work regardless oflight condition and ofobscuration oftheobject being seen, and intheunparalled ease with which target range and itsrate of change can bemeasured.
Incertain other respects radar isdefinitely inferior totheeye.
The detailed definition ofthepicture itoffers isvery much poorer than that afforded bythe eye.
Even the most advanced radar equipment can on]yshow thegross outlines ofalarge object, such asaship; theeye can—if itcan seetheship atall—pick out fine details such astherails onthedeck and thenumber orcharacter oftheflags at the masthead.
Because ofthis grossness ofradar vision, the objects that can usefully beseen byradar arenot asnumerous asthe objects that canabe distinguished bytheeye.
Radar isatitsbest indealing with isolated targets located inarelatively featureless background, such as aircraft inthe air, ships ontheopen sea, islands and coastlines, cities in aplain, and thelike.
Though modern high-definition radar does afford afairly detailed presentation ofsuch acomplex target asacity viewed from the air(see, forexample, Fig.
335), the radar picture ofsuch a target isincomparably poorer indetail than avertical photograph taken under favorable conditions would be.
One further property ofradar isworth remarking: itsfreedom from difficulties ofperspective, By suitable design ofthe equipment, the picture obtained from aradar setcan bepresented asatrue plan view, 1  SEC.
12] HOWRADAR WORKS 3 the radar picture would have been unaffected while photography or ordinary vision would have been useless.
1.2.
How Radar Works.—The coined word rodaris derived from the descriptive phrase “radio detection and ranging.
”Radar works by sending out radio waves from atransmitter powerful enough sothat measurable amounts ofradio energy will bereflected from theobjects to beseenby theradar toaradio receiver usually located, forconvenience, atthesame siteasthetransmitter.
The properties ofthereceived echoes areused toform apicture ortodetermine certain properties oftheobjects that cause theechoes.
Theradar transmitter may send out c-wsignals, orfrequency-modulated c-w signals, orsignals modulated inother ways.
Many schemes based ontransmissions ofvarious sorts have been proposed and some ofthem have been used.
Chapter 5ofthis book treats the general radar problem, inwhich any scheme oftransmitter modulation may beused, inavery fundamental and elegant way.
Despite the great number ofways inwhich aradar system can in principle bedesigned, one ofthese ways has been used tosuch anover- whelming degree that thewhole ofthis book, with theexception ofChap.
5,isdevoted toit.
When radar ismentioned without qualification in this book, pulse radar will bemeant.
NTOapology forthis specialization isneeded.
Thousands oftimes asmuch effort asthat expended onall other forms ofradar put together has gone into the remarkably swift development ofpulse radar since itsorigin intheyears just before World War II.
Inpulse radar, the transmitter ismodulated insuch away that it sends outvery intense, very brief pulses ofradio energy atintervals that arespaced rather farapart interms oftheduration ofeach pulse.
During thewaiting time ofthetransmitter between pulses, thereceiver isactive.
Echoes arereceived from thenearest objects soon after thetransmission ofthepulse, from objects farther away ataslightly later time, and soon.
When sufficient time haselapsed toallow forthereception ofechoes from the most distant objects ofinterest, the transmitter iskeyed again to send another very short pulse, and the cycle repeats.
Since the radio waves used inradar arepropagated with the speed oflight, c,the delay between the transmission ofapulse and thereception ofthe echo from anobject atrange Rwill be (1) thefactor 2entering because thedistance tothetarget hastobetraversed twice, once out and once back, Figure 1.2shows schematically the principle ofpulse radar.

1.2] HOWRADAR WORKS 5 theclue totheease tithwtich range can remeasured byradar.
Range measurement isreduced toameasurement oftime, and time can be measured perhaps more accurately than any other basic physical quan- tity.
Because the velocity oflight ishigh, the intervals oftime that must bemeasured inradar are short.
Numerically, the range corre- sponding toagiven delay time is164 ydforeach microsecond elapsing between thetransmission ofthepulse and thereception oftheecho.
If itisdesired tomeasure range toaprecision of5yd,which isnecessary in some applications ofradar, time intervals must bemeasured with a precision better than &psec.
Modern electronic timing and display techniques have been developed tosuch apoint that this can readily be done.
One ofthesimplest ways inwhich radar echo signals can bedisplayed isshown inFig.
1.3.
The beam ofacathode-ray tube iscaused tobegin asweep from lefttoright across theface ofthetube attheinstant apulse issent from thetransmitter.
The beam isswept totheright atauniform rate bymeans ofasawtooth waveform applied tothehorizontal deflection plates oftheCRT.
The output signals oftheradar receiver areapplied tothe vertical deflection plates.
Toensure that the weakest signals that areatalldetectable arenot missed, theover-all gain ofthereceiver ishigh enough sothat thermal noise originating inthereceiver (Sec.
2.7) isperceptible onthe display.
The two signals that rise significantly above this noise inFig.
1.3are, ontheleft, the“tail” ofthetransmitted 6 INTRODUCTION [SEC.
1.3 pulse leaking into the receiver, and ontheright, the echo signal from a radar target.
The target intheparticular case ofFig.
1“3istheearth’s moon.
The measurement ofrange bymeans ofradar isthus astraightforward problem oftime measurement.
Itisalso desirable tobeable tomeasure thedirection inwhich atarget lies asviewed from aradar station.
In principle, this can bedone onthe basis oftriangulation, using range information onthesame target from two ormore separate radar locations.
Although this method permits ofgreat accuracy and has occasionally been used forspecial purposes, itisfarmore desirable from the stand- point ofsimplicity and flexibility tomeasure direction, aswell asrange, from asingle radar station.
Measurement oftarget bearing was made possible bythe development ofradio techniques onwavelengths short enough topermit theuse ofhighly directional antennas, sothat amore orless sharp beam ofradiation could beproduced byanantenna of reasonable physical size.
When thepulses aresent outinsuch abeam, echoes will bereceived only from targets that lieinthe direction the beam ispointing.
Ifthe antenna, and hence the radar beam, isswept orscanned around the horizon, the strongest echo will bereceived from each target when thebeam ispointing directly toward thetarget, weaker echoes when the beam ispointed alittle toone side ortheother ofthetarget, and noecho atallwhen itispointing inother directions.
Thus, the bearing ofa target can bedetermined bynoting the bearing ofthe radar antenna when that target gives thestrongest echo signal.
This can bedone ina variety ofways, and more precise and convenient means fordetermining target bearing bymeans ofradar have been developed (Chap.
6),but the method described here illustrates thebasic principle.
Itisconvenient toarrange theradar display sothat, instead ofshow- ing target range only, asinFig.
1.3, itshows the range and angular disposition ofalltargets atallazimuths.
The plan-position indicator, orPPI, isthemost common and convenient display ofthis type.
Figure 1.1isaphotograph ofaPPI-scope.
The direction ofeach echo signal from thecenter ofthePPI shows itsdirection from theradar; itsdistance from the center isproportional totarget range.
Many other forms of indication areconvenient forspecial purposes; thevarious types ofindi- cator arecataloged inChap.

Components ofaRadar System.—A radar setcan beconsidered asseparable, forthepurposes ofdesign and description, into several major components concerned with different functions.

This sends ahigh-power, high-voltage pulse to themagnetron, which isthetype oftransmitting tube almost universally used inmodern radar.
For the brief duration ofthe modulator pulse, which may typically be1~sec, the magnetron oscillates atthe radio frequency forwhich itisdesigned, usually some thousands ofmegacycles persecond.
The r-fpulse thus produced travels down the r-ftransmis- sion line shown bydouble lines inFig.
1.4, and passes through the two switches designated asTR and ATR.
These aregas-discharge devices ofavery special sort.

The ATR (for anti-TR) switch, when fired, simply permits ther-fpulse from thetrans- mitter topass through itwith negligible loss.
Between pulses, when these gas-discharge switches are inanunfired state, the TR switch connects thernher totheantenna, and theATR disconnects themagne- tron toprevent loss ofany part ofthefeeble received signal.
After passing through these two switches, the transmitter pulse travels down the r-fline tothe antenna, where itisradiated.

After the transmission ofthe pulse, the discharges inthe TR and ATRstitches cease andthesystem isready toreceive echoes.
Echoes arepicked upbythe antenna and sent down the r-fline tothe mixer.
The mixer isanonlinear device which, inaddition toreceiving thesignals from theantenna, issupplied c-w power from alocal oscillator operating atafrequency only afew tens ofmegacycles persecond away from the magnetron frequency.
The difference frequency that results from mixing these two signals contains the same intelligence asdid the original r-f echoes, but itisatasufficiently low frequency (typically, 30Me/see) to beamplilied bymore orless conventional techniques intheintermediate- frequency amplifier shown.
Output signals from the i-famplifier are demodulated byadetector, and theresulting unipolar signals arefurther amplified byavideo-frequency amplifier similar tothose familiar in television technique.
The output signals ofthevideo amplifier arepassed totheindicator, which displays them, letussay fordefiniteness, inplan-position form.
Inorder todothis, itmust receive atiming pulse from themodulator, to indicate theinstant atwhich each oftheuniform range sweeps outfrom thecenter ofthe PPI tube should begin.
Itmust also receive from the scanner information onthe direction inwhich the antenna ispointing, inorder that therange sweep beexecuted intheproper direction from the center ofthetube.

The Performance ofRadar.-In discussing the performance of radar, one usually refers toitsrange pwforrnunce-that is,themaximum distance atwhich some target ofinterest will return asufficiently strong signal tobedetected.
The factors that determine range performance are numerous and they interact inarather complicated way.
Chapter 2is devoted toadiscussion ofthem, and Chap.
3deals with the important matter oftheproperties ofradar targets.
The usual inverse-square law which governs theintensity ofradiation from apoint source acts todetermine therange dependence ofthefraction ofthetotal transmitted energy that falls onatarget.
Sofarastheecho isconcerned, thetarget can also bethought ofasapoint source ofradia- SEC.

Inconsequence, the echo energy received from atarget varies with the inverse fourth power oftherange from theradar settothetarget, other factors being constant.

1.5.—Historical development ofmicrowave magnetrons.
However formidable this requirement appears, one ofthe most remarkable facts ofthe wartime years ofdevelopment ofradar isthat practicable pulse powers inthemicrowave frequency range (about 1000 Me/see and above) have increased byafactor ofhundreds inarelatively short time.
This stupendous advance resulted from the invention and rapid improvement ofthe multicavity magnetron, which isdescribed in Chap.
10.
Figure 1.5shows thehistory ofmagnetron development, with respect topulse power and efficiency, atthethree most important micro- wave bands exploited during thewar.
The curves arerather arbitrarily drawn, and only their general trend issignificant.
Not every upward 10 INTRODUCTION [SEC.
14 step inoutput power was due toanimprovement inthemagnetron itself.
The increase at10-cm wavelength intheearly part of1941 was brought about bythedevelopment ofmodulators ofhigher power.
Itisimportant torealize that the curves ofFig.
1.5lieabove one another inthe order ofincreasing wavelength not because development was begun earlier at10cmthan at3cm, and earlier at3cmthan at1cm, but because magnetrons ofthetype used inradar aresubject toinherent limitations onmaximum power which are more severe the shorter the wavelength.
The same istrue ofthe r-ftransmission lines used at microwave frequencies.
The horizontal dashed lines shown inFig.
15a show the maximum power that can behandled inthe standard sizes of ‘‘waveguide” used forr-ftransmission atthethree bands.
Asimilarly spectacular decrease inthe minimum detectable signal, due tothe improvement ofmicrowave radar receivers, has marked the war years.
Inthewavelength bands above about 10m,natural “static” and man-made interference setarather high noise level above which signals must bedetected, sothat there islittle necessity forpursuing the best possible receiver performance.
This isnot true atmicrowave fre- quencies.
Natural and man-made interference can beneglected atthese frequeficies incomparison with the unavoidable inherent noise ofthe receiver.
This has put apremium onthe development ofthe most sensitive receivers possible; attheend of1945 microwave receivers were within afactor of10oftheoretically perfect performance.
Improvement bythis factor of10would increase the range ofaradar setonly bythe factor 1.8; and further receiver improvement can today bewon only by themost painstaking and difficult attention todetails ofdesign.
WhyMicrowave s?-The reader will have observed that when radar is discussed inwhat has gone before, microwave radar isassumed.
This is true ofthe balance ofthis book aswell.
Sofarasthe authors ofthis book areconcerned, theword m.dar implies not only pulse radar, ashas already been remarked, but microwave pulse radar.
Though itistrue that theefforts ofthe Radiation Laboratory were devoted exclusively to microwave pulse radar, this attitude isnot entirely parochialism.
The fact isthat fornearly every purpose served byradar, microwave radar ispreferable.
There areafew applications inwhich longer-wave radar isequally good, and avery fewwhere long waves aredefinitely preferable, butfortheoverwhelming majority ofradar applications microwave radar isdemonstrably far more desirable than radar operating atlonger wavelengths.
The superiority ofmicrowave radar arises largely because ofthe desirability offocusing radar energy into sharp beams, sothat thedirec- tion aswell asthe range oftargets can bedetermined.
Inconformity with the well-known laws ofphysical optics, bywhich the sharpness of SEC.1.4] THEPERFORMANCE OFRADAR 11 thebeam passing through anaperture ofgiven size depends ontheratio ofthediameter ofthe aperture tothewavelength oftheradiation inthe beam, the sharpness ofthe beam produced byaradar antenna (which can bethought ofasasort ofaperture fortheradio energy) depends on the ratio ofthe antenna dimensions tothe wavelength used.
For an antenna ofgiven size, thebreadth ofthebeam produced isproportional tothewavelength.
These statements aremade precise inSec.
9.1.
Particularly inthe case ofairborne radar, where alarge antenna cannot betolerated foraerodynamic reasons, itisimportant toproduce sharp radar beams with anantenna structure ofmodest size.
This demands the use ofmicrowaves.
Roughly speaking, microwaves are radio waves whose wavelength isless than 30cm.
Radar definition, itsability todiscriminate between targets close together inspace, improves asthe beamwidth isnarrowed.
Targets at thesame range can bedistinguished byradar asbeing separate ifthey areseparated inazimuth byanangle larger than one beamwidth; thus thequality ofthe picture afforded byradar improves asthebeamwidth isreduced.
For anantenna ofgiven size, thebeamwidth canbedecreased only bylowering thewavelength.
The finite velocity oflight sets alimit tothedesirable beamwidth if aregion offinite size istobescanned atagiven speed byaradar set.
Chapter 4considers this and other limitations ofpulse radar insome detail.
ThePropagation ofMicrowaves.
—Further limitations ontheperform- ance ofradar arise from thepropagation properties ofradio waves inthe microwave region ofthe electromagnetic spectrum.
Like light, micro- waves arepropagated instraight lines.
Unlike radio waves atfrequencies lower than about 30Me/see, microwaves are not reflected from the ionosphere.
This means that the maximum range ofaradar setwhose performance isnot otherwise limited will besetbythe optical horizon which occurs because the earth isround.
This isinfact thelimitation onthe performance ofthe best radar Sets developed during the war.
Under certain conditions, bending ofthe microwave beam around the earth isproduced bymeteorological conditions (Sec.
2.14).
This can increase the range ofaradar setbeyond the optical horizon, but such phenomena arerelatively rare and essentially unpredictable.
Alower limit onthe wavelengths which can beused forpractical radar systems isfixed bythe onset ofatmospheric absorption ofmicro- wave energy.
Below awavelength ofabout 1.9cm, serious absorption occurs inmoist atmosphere, because ofamolecular transition inwater vapor which canbeexcited bytheradiation (Sec.
2.15).
For this reason, 2cmisabout the shortest wavelength atwhich radar systems ofgood range performance can bebuilt.
For certain very special applications 12 INTRODUCTION [SEC.
1.5 where high absorption can betolerated oriseven welcome, shorter wave- lengths can beused, but 2cmisagood practical limit.
The wartime development ofradar components and systems at1.25 cmantedated the discovery ofthe strong water-vapor absorption atthis wavelength.
A wavelength of1.25 cmis,fortuitously, very nearly themost unforttinate choice that could have been made inthe development ofanew short- wavelength band.
105.
Radar Systems.—The uses made ofradar were sovarious under wartime conditions that many different systems were developed tofill different needs.
These systems usually differed more inregard tobeam shape, scanning means, and mode ofindication than inregard toany other properties.
Chapter 6gives abrief conspectus ofthe principal varieties ofradar, with especial emphasis onthose types that promise to have animportant peacetime use.
Two examples ofthedetailed design ofradar systems are given inChap.
15,after the components ofradar systems have been discussed.
Considerable usehas been made ofradar beacons.
These ,aredevices which, onreceiving apulse oraseries ofproperly coded pulses from a radar set, will send back inreply apulse oraseries ofcoded pulses.
A great increase intheflexibility and convenience oftheuseofradar under certain conditions can beobtained bytheuse ofsuch beacons.
Abrief account oftheir properties and uses, though not oftheir design, will be found inChap.
8.
Toward theend ofthewar, two major’ developments occurred which promised toextend greatly theapplicability ofpulse radar under unfavor- able conditions.
Means were developed forreproducing radar indications atapoint distant from thesetthat gathered theoriginal data; theintelli- gence necessary was transmitted from theradar tothedistant indicator byradio means.
This radar relay, asithascome tobecalled, isdescribed insome detail inChap.
17.
Chapter 16deals with another important development—namely, the modification ofpulse-radar equipment sothat itwill display only targets that areinmotion relative totheradar.
Such moving-target indication ispotentially ofgreat importance infreeing radar from thelimitations of site.
Atthepresent, aradar site must bechosen with careful attention tothesurrounding terrain; hills orbuildings within theline ofsight can return strong “permanent echoes” which mask target signals over alarge part ofthe desirable coverage oftheset.
Inmountainous temati, this problem isvery serious.
Anarrangement that gives signals only from targets that aremoving appears tobethebest solution tothepermanent- echo problem.
Afact that has been too little recognized when radar systems are discussed isthat the organization which istomake useofthepositional SEC.1.6] THEEARLY HISTORY OFRADAR 13 information afforded byradar isusually atleast asimportant asisthe radar itself.
Agood organization can make excellent useeven ofinferior radar information, aswas proved bythe success ofthe British Home Chain ofradar stations, thefirst large-scale radar installation tobemade.
An inadequate organizational set-up can doapoor job, even though provided with splendid radar from thetechnical standpoint.
The many problems that enter into thecreation ofanadequate organization forthe useofradar data have notreceived thestudy that they should.
Despite this fact, Chap.
7attempts toprovide anintroduction tothis sort of planning, and toraise some oftheimportant problems, even though they may not yetbesatisfactorily solved.

The Early History ofRadar.—Though the complete history of theorigins and thegrowth ofmodern radar isalong and complicated one, 1 itwill beofsome interest tosketch here itsmain lines, with especial reference toAllied developments.
Successful pulse radar systems were developed independently in America, England, France, and Germany during thelatter 1930’s.
Back oftheir development layhalf acentury ofradio development forcommu- nication purposes, and ahandful ofearly suggestions that, since radio waves areknown tobereflected byobjects whose size isoftheorder ofa wavelength, they might beused todetect objects infogordarkness.
The fact that radio waves have optical properties identical with those associated with ordinary visible light was established byHeinrich Hertz in1886, inthefamous series ofexperiments inwhich hefirst discovered radio waves.
Hertz showed, among other things, that radio waves were reflected from solid objects.
In1904 aGerman engineer, Hulsmeyer, was granted apatent inseveral countries onaproposed way ofusing this property inanobstacle detector and navigational aidforships.
In June 1922, Marconi strongly urged the use ofshort waves for radio detection.
The principle ofpulse ranging which characterizes modern radar was first used in1925 byBreit and Tuve, oftheCarnegie Institution ofWashing- ton, formeasuring the height ofthe ionosphere.
2After the successful experiments ofBreit and Tuve, theradio-pulse echo technique became the established method forionospheric investigation inallcountries.
The step from this technique tothenotion ofusing itforthedetection ofair- craft and ships is,inretrospect, not such agreat one; and various indi- viduals took itindependently and almost simultaneously inAmerica, 1Forthefullest treatment ofradar history available, thereader isreferred tothe official history ofDiv.

The interested reader will find this dealt with atlength inDr.
Guerlac’s history.
1Here itwill besufficient toreport the earliest full successes.
Inearly 1939, aradar setdesigned and built atthe Naval Research Laboratory was given exhaustive tests atseaduring battle maneuvers, installed onthe U.S.S.NewYork.
The first contract- forthe commercial manufacture ofradar equipment was letasaresult ofthese tests, fortheconstruction ofsixsets, designated asCXAM (Sec.
6.9), duplicating that used inthetrials.
InNovember 1938, aradar position-finding equipment intended for the control of antiaircraft guns and searchlights, designed and built bytheSignal Corps Laboratories oftheArmy, was given extensive tests bytheCoast Artillery Board, representing the using arm.
This setalso went into quantity manufacture, astheSCR-268 (Sec.
6.14).
AnArmy long-range aircraft- detection setwhose development had been requested earlier bythe Air Corps was demonstrated tothe Secretary ofJt’ar bythe Signal Corps Laboratories inNovember 1939.
Acontract forthe production ofthk equipment, the SCR-270 (and SCR-271; seeSec.
6.9) was letinAugust 1940.
British radar was developed atabout thesame time butitsapplication proceeded atasomewhat faster pace under the immediate threat to England and with considerably greater realism during theearly years of thewar.
During thewinter of1934-1935, theAirMinistry setup aCom- mittee fortheScientific Survey ofAir Defense.
Among thesuggestions itreceived was acarefully worked out plan forthe detection ofaircraft byapulse method, submitted byaScottish physicist, now SirRobert Watson-Watt, then atthehead oftheRadio Department oftheNational Physical Laboratory.
The first experimental radar system ofthetype suggested byWatson- Watt was setupinthe late spring of1935 onasmall island offtheeast coast ofEngland.
Development work during the summer led tothe blocking-out ofthe main features ofthe British Home Chain ofearly- warning stations (Sec.
6“9) byfall.
Work began in1936 toward setting upfive stations, about 25miles apart, toprotect the Thames estuary.
ByMarch 1938, allthese stations—the nucleus ofthefinal Chain-were complete and inoperation under thecharge ofRAF personnel.
British radar development effort was then brought tobear onairborne radar equipment.
Two types were envisaged: asetforthedetection of surface vessels bypatrol aircraft (called ASV, forairtosurface vessel), 1op.ant. SEC.1.7] WARTIME RADAR DEVELOPMENT 15 and anequipment forenabling night fighters tohome onenemy aircraft (called AI, foraircraft interception).
Work was concentrated onASV first, and anexperimental equipment was successfully demonstrated during fleet maneuvers inSeptember 1938.
Experimental AIequipment was working byJune, 1939, and itwas demonstrated tothechief ofRAF Fighter Command inAugust ofthat year.
The AirMinistry asked that 30such systems beinstalled inaircraft inthenext 30days.
Before the end ofSeptember allthese systems had been installed, four having been ready ontheday war broke out.
Emphasis onairborne radar underlined thepoint that, ifsharp radar beams were ever tobeproduced byantennas small enough tocarry inan ~Plane, wavelengths shorter than the 1+mused inearly British air- borne equipment would have tobeemployed.
This led tothe effort that the British put into developing agenerator ofmicrowaves which could give pulse power adequate forradar use.
Byearly 1940, aBritish version ofthe multicavity magnetron had been developed tothe point where itwas anentirely practicable source ofpulsed microwave energy, and thehistory ofmodern radar had begun.
1.7.
Wartime Radar Development inthe United States.
—Before the end of1940, thework onradar ofAmerican and British laboratories had been combined asaresult ofanagreement between thetwo governments for exchange oftechnical information ofamilitary nature.
ABritish Technical Mission arrived inWashington inSeptember 1940 and mutual disclosures were made ofBritish and American accomplishments inradar uptothat time.
Members ofthe British mission visited the N’aval Research Laboratory, the Army Signal Corps Laboratories atFort Monmouth, and theAircraft Radio Laboratory atWright Field, aswell asmanufac- turing establishments engaged inradar work.
They demonstrated their version ofthe cavity magnetron and furnished design information that enabled U.S.manufacturers toduplicate itpromptly.
Indiscussions with the Microwave Committee ofthe National Defense Research Committee, which had been setupafewmonths before, members ofthe British Mission proposed two specific projects which they suggested that the United States undertake: amicrowave aircraft- interception equipment, and amicrowave position finder forantiaircraft lirecontrol.
Toimplement their decision tofollow these suggestions, the Micro- wave Committee oftheNDRC decided tosetupadevelopment labora- tory staffed primarily by physicists from anumber ofuniversities.
They were encouraged inthis step bythe success that the British had already experienced with civilian wartime radar development agencies staffed with physicists having nospecial radio experience but good general scientific training.
After exploring several possibilities, the 16 INTRODUCTION [SEC.
1°7 Microwave Committee persuaded the Massachusetts Institute ofTech- nology toaccept theresponsibility ofadministering thenew laboratory, The Radiation Laboratory, asitwas named, opened itsdoors early in November 1940.
The director ofthe laboratory throughout its62 months oflifewas Dr.
L.A.DuBridge.
The Army and Navy development laboratories were glad todepend onthe new Radiation Laboratory foraninvestigation ofthe usefulness forradar ofthenew microwave region oftheradio spectrum.
They were fully occupied with the urgent engineering, training, and installation problems involved ingetting radar equipment that had already been developed out into actual military and naval service.
Atthe end of 1940, theuseofmicrowaves forradar purposes seemed highly speculative, and theService laboratories quite properly feltittheir duty toconcentrate onradar techniques that had already been worked out successfully.
During 1941, while the Navy was installing long-wave search radar and medium-wavelength fire-control radar onships ofthe fleet, and the Army was sending outSignal Aircraft Warning Battalions equipped with the SCR-270 and antiaircraft batteries with the SCR-268, not asingle item ofradar equipment based onthe new microwave techniques was delivered for operational use.
However, development work atthe Radiation Laboratory had broadened farbeyond thetwo specific projects suggested bythe British Technical Mission, and microwave equipment was showing great promise formany wartime uses.
Afew important dates will indicate the way inwhich this develop- ment was proceeding.
OnJan.
4,1941, theRadiation Laboratory’s first microwave radar echoes were obtained.
Asuccessful flight test ofa working “breadboard” model ofanairborne radar intended forAIuse was made onMarch 10,inaB-18A furnished bythe Army Air Corps.
Inthis fight itwas found that theequipment was extremely effective in searching forships and surfaced submarines atsea.
Inthe late spring of1941, anexperimental microwave sea-search radar equipped with aPPI was installed onthe olddestroyer U.S.S.
Semmes.
OnJune 30, the Navy letthe first production contract for microwave radar equipment based onthework oftheRadiation Labora- tory.
This was foraproduction version ofthesetthat had been demon- strated ontheSemmes.
Attheend ofMay, aprototype ofthemicrowave antiaircraft position finder developed atthe Radiation Laboratory was inoperation.
It accomplished the then-astonishing feat oftracking atarget plane in azimuth and elevation wholly automatically.
These and other early successes ledtoanincreasing Service interest in microwave radar, which had seemed sospeculative aventure in1940.
The tremendous expansion ofthedevelopment program can bemeasured SEC.
1.7] WARTIME RADAR DEVELOPMENT 17 bythe fact that thepersonnel ofthe Radiation Laboratory, which had been about 40atthebeginning of1941, rose tonearly 4000 bymid-1945.
Similarly, theRadar Section oftheNaval Research Laboratory increased itspersonnel to600.
The Radio Position Finding section ofthe Signal Corps Laboratories grew into the Evans Signal Laboratory, with apeak personnel ofmore than 3000.
Asimilar growth took place atthe Air- craft Radio Laboratory atWright Field.
Atremendous amount ofwork was carried outduring thewar bythe research and engineering staffs ofmany industrial concerns, both large and small.
Insome cases, these firms, working either independent y orondevelopment orproduction contracts with thearmed forces orwith NDRC, engineered certain types ofradar sets alltheway through from thebasic idea tothefinished product.
Toalarger extent, thecontribu- tion ofindustry was totake the prototype equipment produced in government laboratories and make the design suitable for quantity manuf acture and for service use tinder combat conditions.
The art advanced sorapidly inthe early years that manufacturers were often called upon tomake major changes during the course ofproduction in order totake account ofnew lessons from both thelaboratories and the battlefields.
The growth oftheradar industry, which scarcely existed before 1940, isindicated bythe fact that bythe end ofJune 1945, approximately $2,700,000,000 worth ofradar equipment had been delivered totheArmy and the Navy.
Atthe end ofthe war, radar equipment was being produced atarate ofmore than $100,000,000 worth permonth.
The enormous wartime investment ofmoney, skill, and productive facilities inradar paid theAllies handsome dividends with thefleet, inthe air, and onthebattlefield.
1The uses ofradar inapeaceful world were jusb beginning tobeworked out in1946.
Some ofthese aredealt with inVol.

But the technical achievement represented by the wartime development ofradar seems very nearly unparalleled.
In terms ofthe time intervening between ‘the reception ofthe first radar signals and thelarge-scale useofradar inthewar, itisasif,seven years after thefirst faltering flight oftheWright brothers atKitty Hawk, the airplane had been developed into apowerful weapon ofwhich thousands were inconstant use.

The factors which control thestrength ofthesignal soreceived areclearly offirst importance indetermining the maximum range ofdetection ofagiven target bya specified radar set.
InSees.
2.1to26weshall formulate and examine the basic relation between these quantities, which iscommonly known asthe “radar equation.
”Specifically, wewant toderive anexpression forthe peak radio-frequency signal power S,available atthe terminals ofthe radar antenna, which will involve measurable properties ofthe transmitting and receiving antenna system, the transmission path through space, and the target itself.
Now this relation will not suffice tofixthe maximum range ofdetection unless the minimum power required fordetection, Sk, isknown.
This important quantity S~ti we prefer todiscuss separately, beginning inSec.
2.7below.
Itwill befound todepend onmany other factors, not allreadily accessible tomeasure- ment, ranging from thermal noise inaresistor totheintegrating property oftheeye oftheradar observer.
Thus wechoose todivide theproblem into two parts, byafictitious boundary, asitwere, between the radar antenna and the rest ofthe set.
The relations which weshall develop inSees.
2.1to2.6arewholly geometrical ones inthesense that thefactors upon which thereceived power Sdepends arealllengths, apart from transmitted power P,towhich, ofcourse, Sisalways proportional.
THE RADAR EQUATION FOR FREE-SPACE PROPAGATION 2.1.
The Meaning ofFree-space Propagation.-Fortunately,the the quasi-optical nature ofmicrowave propagation permits ustoconcentrate our attention atthe outset onavery simple case, which weshall call “free-space propagation.” The circumstances implied would berealized exactly ifradar setand target were isolated inunbounded empty space.
They are realized well enough forpractical purposes ifthe following conditions arefulfilled: 1,Nolarge obstacles intervene between antenna and target, along anoptical line ofsight.

3.The intervening atmosphere ishomogeneous with respect toindex ofrefraction, atthefrequency used.
4.The intervening atmosphere istransparent, i.e., does not absorb energy from thewave, atthefrequency used.
Condition 1restricts our attention totargets within the horizon.
Condition 2bars, forthe present, consideration ofradar search atlow angles over water, although later weshall include this case byasuitable modification oftheradar equation.
Microwave radar over land appears toberelatively free, even atlow angles, from thereflection effects which aresopronounced atlonger wavelengths.
Inany case, ifthedirectivity oftheantenna pattern issuch that very little energy strikes thereflecting surface, Condition 2isfulfilled.
Any implications ofConditions 3and 4 which arenotself-evident will beclarified inthelast part ofthis chapter, where other types ofpropagation will bediscussed.
If,now, these condi- tions offree-space propagation apply, the result isvery simple: The transmitted wave, atany considerable distance from the antenna, 1has spherical wavefronts—limited inextent,.
ofcourse, bythe radiation pattern ofthe antenna—which spread sothat the intensity ofthe dis- turbance falls offwith theinverse square ofthedistance.
2.2.
Antenna Gain and Receiving Cross Section.
-If thetransmitting antenna were toradiate energy isotropically-that is,uniformly inall directions—the power flow through unit area atadistance Rfrom the antenna could befound bydividing P,the total radiated power, by 4TRZ.
Adirective antenna, however, will concentrate the energy in certain directions.
The power flow observed atsome distant point will differ bysome factor Gfrom that which would beproduced byanantenna radiating isotropically thesame total power.
This factor Giscalled the “gain” ofthe antenna inthe direction inquestion.
Byour definition, thegain ofthehypothetical isotropic radiator is1inevery direction.
For any other antenna Gwill begreater than 1insome directions and less than 1inothers.
Itisclear that Gcould not begreater than 1inevery direction, and infact theaverage ofGtaken over thewhole sphere must bejust 1.
Usually weareinterested inantennas forwhich Ghas avery pro- nounced maximum inone direction, that istosay, antennas which 1Thelimitation implied istodistances greater than all/X, where disthewidth of theantenna aperture andxthewavelength.
Atdistances Rlessthan this(less than 366ft,forexample, forx=3cm,d=6ft),theintensity does notfalloffas1/RJ.

This maximum value ofGweshall denote byGO.
The narrow, concentrated beams which are characteristic of microwave radar require, fortheir formation, antennas large compared toawavelength.
Innearly every case theradiating system amounts to anaperture oflarge area over which asubstantially plane wave isexcited.
For such asystem, afundamental relation connects the maximum gain G,,thearea oftheaperture A,and thewavelength: (1) The dimensionless factor .fisequal to1ifthe excitation isuniform in phase and intensity over thewhole aperture; inactual antennas fisoften aslarge as0.6or0.7and israrely less than 0.5.
Anantenna formed bya paraboloidal mirror 100 cmindiameter, forawavelength of10cm, would have again of986 according toEq.
(1)with ~=1,and inpractice might bedesigned toattain GO=640.
The connection between gain and beamwidth iseasily seen.
Using anaperture ofdimensions dinboth directions, abeam may beformed whose angular width, 1determined bydiffraction, isabout X/dradians.
The radiated power isthen mainly concentrated inasolid angle ofX2/dZ.
Anisotropic radiator would spread the same power over asolid angle of4T.
Therefore, weexpect thegain tobeapproximately 4rd2/X’, which isconsistent with Eq.
(1),since thearea oftheaperture isabout d’.For amore rigorous discussion ofthese questions the reader isreferred to Vol.

Acomplementary property ofanantenna which isofimportance equal tothat ofthe gain isthe e.fective receiving crosssection.
This quantity hasthedimensions ofanarea, and when multiplied bythepower density (power perunit area) ofanincident plane wave yields the total signal power available atthe terminals ofthe antenna.

Quite generally A,will depend onthe area ofthe antenna aperture and not on~, whereas GOwill depend onA/h2.
2.3.
Scattering Cross Section ofthe Target.—We have toconsider how thetarget itself enters theradar problem.
Evidently weneed some measure ofthe amount ofpower reflected bythe target.
For this purpose wedefine the scattering cross section ofthetarget uasfollows: u(dimensions ofanarea) istobe4Ttimes theratio ofthepower perunit solid angle scattered back toward thetransmitter, tothe power density (power per unit area) inthe wave incident onthe target.
Inother words, ifatthe target the power incident onanarea uplaced normal tothebeam were tobescattered uniformly inalldirections, theintensity ofthesignal received back attheradar setwould bejust what itisinthe case ofthe actual target.
Insome respects “radar cross section” isa more appropriate name foruinsofarasitindicates that weareconcerned only with thepower scattered directly back toward thetransmitter.
Itisessential torealize that the cross section ofagiven target will depend notonly upon thewavelength but upon theangle from which the target isviewed bytheradar.
The fluctuation ofuwith “target aspect,” asitiscalled, isdue totheinterference ofreflected waves from various parts ofthetarget (see Chap.
3).
only forcertain special cases canube calculated rigorously; formost targets uhastobeinferred from theradar data themselves.
Usually this cannot bedone inany uniform way because ofthefluctuation referred to,and itmay bewell toassert atthis point that intelligent useoftheformulas which weshall derive, inallof which uappears, requires anappreciation ofthese limitations.

The sole restriction which has not yetbeen made explicit isthat Gshould notvary significantly over theangle which thetarget subtends attheradar antenna.
Usually weshall beinterested inthesignal that isreturned when the target lies somewhere along the maximum ofthe radar beam, and we should then replace GbyG,.

Itis easy toproduce such abeam bymeans ofanantenna whose effective aperture iswide inthedirection inwhich the beam istobenarrow and narrow inthe direction inwhich the beam istobebroad.
The con- nection given byEq.

Itwould bemost desirable toadjus~the-directional pattern oftheantenna sothat just the desired angular coverage, and nomore, would beobtained.
Aprescription for such anantenna pattern can beobtained from thebasic radar equation, Eq.

Evidently some sort offanbeam, as narrow aspossible inthehorizontal direction but spread outvertically, is demanded.

Itiseasy tosee that thearea ofthepatch ontheground, such asCinFig.

Also, the effectiveness ofsuch apatch undoubtedly depends onthe angle from which itisviewed.

2.6.
The Beacon Equation.-So farwehave confined ourattention to the“two-way” radar problem, inwhich the route from transmitter to receiver isacomplete round trip involving scattering ofthe energy by some remote object.
Radar beacons operate onadifferent principle.
A receiving antenna ataremote point picks updirectly energy sent out from the radar transmitter.
The signal isamplified and enabled to initiate the transmission ofanother signal, inreply, byanassociated transmitter.
This signal, received back atthe radar, provides an artificial echo which can beutilized invarious ways (Chap.
8).
Here theanalogue ofthe radar equation forradar-beacon operation will be discussed.
Itisclear that wehave todowith two entirely independent processes, each ofwhich consists simply ofone-way transmission and reception.
Consider thefirst process, usually called “interrogation.” LetP,bethe power transmitted bythe radar, ~bthe signal power received bythe beacon antenna.
These must berelated by ()A%=p, =) (14) where G,and Gbarethe gains ofthe radar and beacon antennas respec- tively.
The subsequent process ofbeacon reply isdescribed byasimilar equation with the subscripts band rinterchanged throughout.
Ifthe same antenna orsimilar antennas are employed for transmission and reception atthebeacon and likewise attheradar, asisnearly always the case, thequantity intheparenthesis hasthesame value forinterrogation andreply, and wecan infer thecorollary relation s P,,b E–P,(15) Inpractice, the gain G,ofthebeacon antenna isfixed atarelatively lownumber bytherequirement ofsomething like omnidirectional cover- age.
The remaining factor intheparenthesis inEq.
(14) isthequantity G,k* which isproportional tothe aperture ofthe radar antenna.
This leads one tosuspect that long beacon ranges should be,ingeneral, more difficult toachieve atshorter wavelengths.
Antenna apertures are rarely increased inarea when shorter wavelengths areemployed: onthe other hand, available r-fpower generally decreases markedly with decreasing wavelength.
Actually this has not proved tobeaserious 28 THERADAR EQUATION [SEC.
!2.7 limitation down towavelengths oftheorder of3cm, because ranges that can beachieved arealready very great and arelimited usually bythe horizon rather than bythe relation expressed inEq.
(14).
That isto say, the condition offree-space propagation, which wehave assumed in this section, often does not apply atthe extremity ofthe microwave- beacon range.
Long beacon ranges are, ofcourse, aresult oftheenormous advantage ofone-way over tw~way transmission.
Ifwecompare Eq.
(14) with Eq.
(4), weseethat insignal strength forgiven transmitted power the beacon process enjoys the advantage ofafactor of4flJP/G+s.
Itis interesting tocompute the limiting free-space range forabeacon oper- ating inconjunction with aradar setofthe characteristics assumed in our earlier radar example.
Let ussuppose that the gain ofthe beacon antenna is10,and that the tranwnitted power and minimum required signal power forthebeacon arethesame asthose assumed fortheradar set.
Using Eq.
(14) weobtain forthemaximum range, either forinter- rogation orreply, 60,000 statute miles.
Inconclusion, wemay point out that Eq.
(14), although ithas been written innotation appropriate totheradar-beacon problem, applies, of course, toany one-way transmission problem where free-space propaga- tion can beassumed.
Applications ofEq.
(14) are tobefound in the fields ofmicrowave radar relay, radar jamrning, and microwave communication.
THE MINIMUM DETECTABLE SIGNAL 2.7.
Noise.—It iswell known that despite our ability toamplify afeeble electrical signal bypractically any desired factor, itisstill not possible todiscern anarbitrarily weak signal because ofthe presence of random elect rical fluctuations, or“noise.” Ifthe true signal entering any receiver ismade weaker and weaker, itsubsides eventually into the fluctuating background ofnoise and islost.
What istheorigin ofthese fluctuations, and what factors determine precisely the level atwhich theradar signal ishopelessly obscured bythem? Before weattempt toanswer these decisive questions, itisworth while toconsider briefly the limit ofuseful sensitivity ofanordinary low-frequency radio receiver.
This limit isalso set byrandom dis- turbances, but inthis case the largest random disturbances with which the signal must compete originate generally not inthe receiver itself but elsewhere inspace.
Whatever their sourc+and this may range from apassing trolley car tothe mysterious reaches ofinterstellar spat-these disturbances enter the receiver byway ofthe antenna.
The crucial quantity istherefore the ratio ofthe field strength ofthe signal intheneighborhood oftheantenna tothat ofnoise orinterference. SEC.2.7] NOISE 29 The absolute magnitudes ofsignal and interference power available attheantenna terminals areoflittle importance; only their ratio, which, forexample, might befavorably altered bythe use ofadirectional antenna pattern, determines the ultimate performance.
This circum- stance isperhaps one reason why the effective receiving cross section ofanordinary radio antenna isanumber oflittle interest and isindeed rarely discussed inradio engineering texts.
More significantly, it explains why the emphasis inthe development ofradio receivers has been mainly onimproving discrimination against some ofthe external noise (for example, bygreater frequency selectivity) rather than on reduction ofnoise inherent inthereceiver.
The situation isdifferent inthe microwave region.
Substantially allthe noise originates inthe receiver itself, not because microwave receivers are noisier ormore imperfect receivers than low-frequency receivers—f orthey arenot, asarulel—but because noise and interference originating outside the receiver are enormously greater atthe lower frequencies.
Infact, such noise inthe microwave region isalmost wholly negligible inexisting receivers.
2Itisthe noise that originates inthe receiver itself against which the signal power determined by Eq.
(3)must compete forrecognition.
The level offluctuations inanotherwise quiescent electrical circuit can bedescribed inmany equivalent ways.
One description ofwhich weshall make useisthefollowing.
Let Rbethereal part oftheimped- ance measured, atfrequency f,between two points inapassive electrical network, alldissipative parts ofwhich are inthermal equilibrium at absolute temperature 2’.
Then letthe voltage ebetween these two points bemeasured byanideal voltmeter which iscapable ofindicating, without disturbing thecircuit inany way, thetime average ofthesquare ofe,denoted bye~,over asmall frequency range 6$3intheneighborhood ofthefrequency f.Itwill befound that ~sodefined isgiven by (16) where kisBoltzmann’s constant (1.38 X10–23 jouIes/degree).
1Very fewlow-frequency receivers approach thebest modern microwave receivers inrespect tosignal-to-noise ratio, despite thefactthat itiseasier toattain alownoise figure atlowfrequencies, other things being equal.
2Future large-scale exploitation ofthemicrowave bands may change thepicture, although not,perhaps, asmuch asonemight atfirstsuppose.
Both theoptical nature ofmicrowave propagation andthevast frequency band available inthemicrowave region ofthespectrum mitigate mutual interference.
?Weuse~forbandwidth throughout, foruniformity, although itiscommon practice, and insome respects preferable, towrite Eq.

Inpractice, however, theantenna isusually notterminated inanopen circuit, forreasons which were ignored when wemade ourearlier assump- tions about the ideal nature ofthe amplifier D.Without trying todo justice tothis complicated and important problem weshall say only that when other sources ofnoise—in particular, noise inthe output ofthe 1Itisinteresting tonote that thisresult canbederived directly from thetheory of black-body radiation byassuming (aswehave tacitly done already) theantenna tobe enclosed inaregion allattemperature 1’,andmaking useofthereceiving cross section oftheantenna given byEq.(2), 32 THERADAR EQUATION [SEC.

The condition R=Zis,infact, not unusual.
This condition, inourideal system ofFig.
2.3, leads to (21) Aquestion offundamental interest, though not asyet ofmuch practical moment, isthe one raised eaiiier about thetemperature tobe assigned tothe antenna radiation resistance.
This iscertainly notin general the temperature ofthemetal parts ofthe,antenna.
The reader may correctly surmise, from what has been said, that theeffective tem- perature ofthis element ofthecircuit isthat ofany surroundings ofthe antenna with which theantenna can exchange energy byradiation—that istosay, itisthetemperature (orasuitable average ofthetemperatures) ofwhatever would absorb energy radiated bythe antenna asatrans- mitter.
This hasindeed been demonstrated experimentally.
Ithasbeen shown 1that amicrowave antenna pointed atthesky receives only avery small amount ofradiation, corresponding toanabsolute temperature of atmost afew degrees.
Ifourreceivers were very nearly ideal this would have the practical result ofmaking itmuch easier todetect aircraft appearing athigh angles ofelevation.
Inthebest existing receivers the reduction innoise output which could beobtained bypointing theantenna upward would amount tosome 10per cent.
The foregoing somewhat academic discussion ofthermal noise would beinappropriate inthis place were itnotfortwo facts.
First, microwave receivers, even asthis iswritten, have been brought soclose tothe pinnacle ofideal performance that itiswell forthe radar engineer to appreciate the nearness, and the finality, ofthe goal.
Second, thermal noise, although itisnot wholly toblame forthe noise background in microwave receivers, provides avery convenient standard interms of which theperformance ofanactual receiver can bespecified.

The Statistical Problem.~It might seem that wcnow have within ourgrasp aspecification forS& which can beintroduced into the radar equation toyield the maximum range ofdetection, R~a,.Unfor- tunately, itisnotsosimple asthat.
Letussummarize what wedoknow, once weareprovided with theover-all noise figure and bandwidth ofthe receiver, thetransmitted power, and thegeometrical factors intheradar equation which concern theantenna and thetarget.
Weknow theratio oftheamplified signal power totheaverage value ofthe amplified noise power.
We arenotyet able tosay how large this ratio must bebefore thesignal can beidentified with reasonable certainty.
The root ofthe difficulty isthat wehave todowith astatistical problem, agame of chance.
The answers will begiven asprobabditics, and will depend upon many features ofthesystem bywhich thesignal ispresented tothe observer, aswell asupon the precise description ofthe “reasonable certainty” mentioned above.
We approach theproblem byexamining first the character ofthenoise fluctuations.
The output noise power will fluctuate continually and irregularly above and below itsaoer-age value, the latter being understood asan average taken over atime long enough toinclude very many fluctuations.
An example that iseasy todiscuss quantitatively isthe following.
Suppose that theintermediate frequency amplifier isfollowed byasquare- law detector and byfurther (video) amplification instages whose pass band issobroad astointroduce nodistortion ofthe signal.
The final output voltage isthen adirect measure oftheinstantaneous power output ofthei-famplifier.
I,et this voltage bedisplayed, asafunction oftime, onanoscilloscope.
Figure 245a shows atypical single trace which might heobtained inthis way.
Now inspite ofthewildly irregular nature of the noise voltage, the theory ofrandom processes applied tothis case 36 THERADAR EQUATION [SEC.
2.10 (Vol.
24,Chap.
8)leads tocertain positive statements.
First, therapid- ityofthefluctuations isdetermined bythebandwidth @oftheamplifier.
That istosay, inatime short compared with l/(B, itisextremely unlikely that the output power will change noticeably.
1On the other hand, during atime long compared with l/01, fluctuations will almost certainly occur, and thevalue ofthepower Pattheend ofsuch along time will bear nosystematic relation atalltothevalue ithappened tohave atthe beginning.
This isaroundabout way ofsaying that values ofPdeter- mined attimes differing bymuch more than 1/6 arestatistical yinde- pendent, or,inother words, I/@ isameasure ofthecorrelation time ofthe fluctuations.
The second statement which can bemade concerns the probability that atsome arbitrarily selected instant theoutput power will befound toliebetween some specified level, P,and P+dP.This probability, which weshall label WI(P)dP,isgiven by W,(P)dP=#oe-$dP.
(22) POistheaverage power, determined over along time.
Astatement which iseasily seen tobeequivalent tothis is:The prob- ability that the power exceeds some specified level P,atanarbitrarily P selected instant, isjust e‘F”.
Thus there isalways afinite chance of getting ahigh noise peak.
For example, theprobability that atagiven time Pisgreater than 5Po ise-5or0.0068.
For the discussion that follows itisconvenient tosimplify the problem somewhat bydividing the time base into discrete intervals each l/CB long.
InFig.
2.6a we would have 50such intervals.
The essential features ofthe noise back- ground canthen bedescribed byregarding these intervals asindependent and associating some onevalue ofPwith each.
Again Eq.
(22) correctly expresses theprobability that thepower, inanarbitrary interval, will lie between Pand P+dP.
The task ofdetecting asignal amid the noise inthis simplified case amounts toselecting aninterval which displays solarge avalue ofP that one isjustified inbetting that thepeak was due toacombination of signal and noise, and nottonoise alone.
This should dispose ofany hope that weshall beable todefine once and forallthe minimum detectable 1Theintermediate frequency itself isassumed tobehigh compared with (B,sothat itispermissible tospeak oftheinstantaneous power while actually meaning thepower averaged over onecycle oftheintermediate frequency.

One can never beabsolutely sure that any observed peak is not due toachance noise fluctuation, and one cannot even say how probable itisthat the peak isnot due tonoise, unless one knows how probable itis,apriori, that thepeak isdue tosomething else-namely, signal plus noise.
Knowledge oftheapriori probability ofthepresence ofsignal ispossible incontrolled experiments such asthose described in Vol.
24,Chap.

For example, itmight bearranged topresent asignal atagiven point ontheoscilloscope sweep about half thetime, theobserver being required tojudge whether ornot thesignal was there.
Ashrewd observer would call “Signal” whenever thescope deflection atthis point was only alittle greater than average, and could score apretty good “batting average” even for rather weak signals.
If,however, he expected thesignal tooccur only very rarely, hewould naturally sethis standard higher, inorder toavoid frequent false identification ofwhat were, infact, noise fluctuations.
For obvious reasons, nosuch clear delineation ofthestatistical prob- lem ispossible inthenormal operation ofaradar set.
However, wecan roughly distinguish different orders ofwhat was called above theapriori probability ofthe signal.
Compare, forexample, theuse ofaradar set forearly warning (detection ofenemy aircraft atagreat distance) and forground control ofaircraft, inwhich aselected plane, already picked upontheradar, isfollowed, itsposition being noted ineach scan.
Inthe latter case, weknow about where tolook forthe echo inagiven scan, having observed theposition intheprevious scan and knowing approxi- mately the course and speed from still earlier information.
Hence, we accept even aweak indication ofthepresence ofsignal ifitcomes near the expected place, with comparatively small chance oferror.
Inthe former case, however, alarge area oftheradar scope must bekept under surveillance foralong time.
The likelihood that ahigh noise peak will beobserved ismuch greater: only avery pronounced peak can now be confidently identified asanew signal.
We have divided our time base into intervals I/@ long.
Inone second than, @intervals come under observation.
If(Bis2Me/see, for example, this amounts to2,000,000 intervals persec.
According toEq.
(22) weexpect tofind among these some hundred that represent noise peaks greater than 10Po.
Inonehour there isbetter than aneven chance ofobserving one noise peak greater than 20P0.
Must wetherefore require that tobedetectable asingle signal pulse beatleast greater than 20P~,orattheterminals oftheantenna, greater than 20NkT@? We should indeed, ifwearespeaking ofasingk signal pulse.
But anyone who has had anything todowith the design oroperation ofa radar setwill perceive atonce that anessential part oftheproblem has sofarbeen ignored.
The fact isthat detection ofatarget byradar 38 THERADAR EQUATION [SEC.
210 practically never depends onthedetection ofalone signal pulse, but on reception, from the same range and bearing, ofrepeated signal pulses.
This has aprofound influence onthe statistical problem that wehave been discussing because, whereas thenoise fluctuations during successive sweeps 1are completely independent, the signal can bemade toappear atthesame position ineach sweep.
Totake advantage ofthis essential difference between signal and noise itisevidently necessary toresort to some method ofinformation storage, orintegration, which would make useoftheinformation contained inseveral sweeps.
Itmight bepossible, Time - (b) Time a (c) FIG.
2.6.—Output noise porrer: (a)single smeep; (b)average oftwosweeps; (c)average of foursweeps, forexample, toaverage over anumber ofs~veeps—that is,topresent to theobserver asingle trace whose height atany time would represent the average ofthe power output which was obtained ineach ofthe several sweeps atthat same time (measured from thetransmitted pulse).
Now this issubstantially what many radar indicators do;itissonearly what they do, infact, that quantitative conclusions drawn from astudy of the ideal process outlined are ofpractical significance and are surpris- ingly well borne out byactual observations.
Therefore, wewant to inquire more carefully into thesimple averaging orintegration process.
IWe usetheterm “sweep” tomean oneentire interval between successive pulse transmissions.
Such aterm unavoidably suggests aparticular type ofdisplay, buta more general andformal terminology seems toocumbersome. SEC.
210] THESTATISTICAL PROBLEM 39 Let usturn toFig.
2.6a,which represents asingle oscilloscope trace starting atthe time ofthe transmitted pulse oratsome known time thereafter.
This isatypical single trace showing noise only, without signal.
1Clearly only arather strong signal could stand outconspicuously among these fluctuations.
Now examine Fig.
2.6binwhich theaverage oftwo noise traces isplotted, each point ihone trace being averaged with the corresponding point inthe other.
The fluctuations are here less violent.
We note ascarcity ofexcessively high peaks: this isnot surprising asitisunlikely that very high peaks, being inany case infre- quent events, should occur atthesame place ontwo original traces.
In Fig.
2.6c, four sweeps with noise have been averaged, and wenotice a further reduction inthemagnitude ofthefluctuations.
Asthesize ofa signal peak(which means, really, signal-plus-noise) will notbeessentially altered bytheaveraging provided thesignal occurs atthesame place on successive sweeps, itwill beeasier todetect asmall signal onthetrace c than ona.
More than this wecannot say without elaborate analysis of thestatistical problem.
Such analysis can becarried through bywell- known methods (see Chap.

Ifthesweep length were equivalent to,forexample, 500 intervals (remember that what wecall an“interval” isabout I/@ long), one would expect tofind several (roughly, five) noise peaks inthe sweep which were higher than the signal peak.
Inthis case weshould certainly need either astronger signal ormore integration.
Now itisthetrendofth6numbers inTable 2.1which isofinterest to us,since any real radar problem will differ inmany particulars from the ideal process towhich Table 2.1applies exactly.
Ifweselect any column (w=constant) weobserve that the variation ofsignal power with nis something intermediate between 1/n and 1/fi.
For large nand par- ticularly forwnot toosmall, thevariation isnot farfrom l/~~.
This implies that doubling thenumber ofsweeps integrated, other things being equal, allows the signal power tobereduced byafactor l/~2.
This relation has been strikingly verified bytheexperiments ofJ.L.Lawson and others (Vol.
24) inthe detection ofsignals onthe A-scope, under conditions where nwas large.
On the other hand, for small n,and especially forvery small values ofw,Table 2.1would require the signal power tovary more nearly asI/n.
This isnottooimportant inpractical radar design, forsomany factors areinvolved inthereal problem that we cannot hope for, and donotneed, avery precise answer tosuch questions.
We shall most frequently assume, inlater chapters, that the required signal power varies asl/~;.
Itmust beobserved, toput the above considerations inproper per- spective, that thebenefits ofintegration arenotconfined tothesmoothing out ofthermal orpurely random noise.
Avery important requirement, inpractice, isdiscrimination against isolated but powerful disturbances such astransients from nearby electrical apparatus, or,very commonly, pulse interference from other radar sets.
Indeed, thefrequency ofsuch disturbances, inmost locations, renders academic our earlier remarks about the likelihood ofgetting anabnormally high noise peak once an hour orso.
The fact that the desired signal occurs repeatedly allows such isolated disturbances tobediscarded easily, ordisregarded.
Strictly itisnot integration, but asort ofcoincidence selection, that ismost potent against these scattered flashes ofinterference.
Such selection isinherent toagreater orlesser degree innearly allradar systems and asarule very little selection suffices.
Inpractice then, itisstill thenoise that wehave tocombat, not the interference, ifwewant toreduce the minimum detectable signal power.’ IBecause thisistrue, anessential part ofanytestofthecondition orquality ofa radar setincludes ameasurement ofthenoise level, oraquantity proportional thereto.
The determination ofminimum discernible signal power under any reproducible conditions ofobservation constitutes such ameasurement. Smc.
2,11] EFFECT OFSTORAGE ONRADAR PERFORMANCE 41 2.11.
Effect ofStorage onRadar Performance.-How istheintegra- tion process, oritsequivalent, actually carried outinaradar set? The earliest and simplest radar indicator istheA-scope, thehorizontal range sweep with vertical deflection bythe signal.
Usually the screen ofthe cathode-ray tube does not give apersistent glow but the picture decays immediately.
Itisdithcult toseeany integrating orstorage mechanism here, and indeed there isnone.
The storage isaccomplished intheeye and mind ofthe ohserver and israther astonishingly effective.
1Just howitisdone wedonot know indetail, but wemay seethe results in Fig.
2.5(page 35).
Note now thesignificance ofthethree curves inthat figure which correspond todifferent pulserepetition jrequew”es with the same total time ofobservation.
Anincrease inPRF byafactor of16, from one curve tothe one below, reduces the signal power required by very nearly afactor of4.
Itisnatural toassume that, whatever the effective number ofintegrations, itisproportional tothe PRF, for constant observation time, and wemay regard theexperiments described byFig.
2.5asevidence favoring therelation s...+;.
(23) InFig.
2.7, which hasbeen taken from Vol.
24ofthis series, anattempt hasbeen made toshow directly the effect ofintegration intheA-scope.
Here the camera has been substituted forthe eye, and the number of sweeps overlapping inone picture has been varied.
Signals ofdifferent strength arepresent attwo positions ineach sweep and byreferring to theexplanation accompanying thefigure, thereader will beable totrace theimprovement indiscrimination from one picture tothe next.
The noise and signal shown, incidentally, were derived from alineardetector.
Inthe case ofanintensity-modulated indicator with apersistent screen, what wehave called “integration” isvery nearly exactly that— namely, the repeated addition, and hence averaging, ofanumber of successive sweeps.
The difference isthat the number ofsweeps soaver- aged isnot sharply defined, since the luminosity ofthe screen decays gradually with time.
However there will besome time which ischarac- teristic ofthe decay, and wecan say simply that ifthe electron beam traces repeatedly over thesame strip ofthescreen, thenumber ofsweeps averaged will beoftheorder ofthepulse repetition frequency times this decay time.
Inpractice, theradar isusually scanning.
That is,before thedecay time elapses, theradar beam moves offthetarget and thecath- ode-ray-tube trace moves toanew position onthescreen.
The number of 1Failure toappreciate thepower oftheobserver tointegrate wasresponsible for some disappointment with early electrical integrating devices, which, through no fault oftheir own, didnotbring theexpected improvement over thesimple A-scope. 42 THERADAR EQUATION [SEC.2.11 sweeps integrated then islimited bythe number ofpulses striking the target during the scan and not bythe screen persistence.
If,however, thelatter issolong that storage iseffective from one scan tothenext, we FIG.2.7.—In thisseries ofphotographs, thenumber ofA-scope sweeps recorded during each exposure wasvaried from 12to400.

Let ustry toelucidate this rather complicated state ofaffairs by SEC.

Suppose that theeffective storage time ofthescreen is4see, and that the angular width oftheradar beam is6°:lettherate ofrotation bevariable.

Let usbegin with the antenna stationary, pointing atasingle target.
The number ofsweeps available forintegration, n~,will belimited bythescreen per- sistence and will be4secX500 see–l, or2000.
This will remain true, even though the antenna rotates, until the rate ofrotation becomes sti great that thebeam dwells onthetarget less than 4see, inother words, upto~rpm.
With increasing speed ofrotation, thenumber ofsweeps integrated will decrease as1/(rpm) until the beam rotates faster than onerevolution in4see, atwhich time webegin toinclude more than one scan inthe integration.

24,Sec.
9“1).
The effect ofscan speed onthreshold-signal level isoften called “scanning loss,” the condition ofscan-speed zero being implied asthe standard ofreference.
This condition merits nomore than any other the distinction ofbeing astandard.
On the contrary, the factors determining Stim areinthis case especially elusive, ifone wants totake them allinto account.
We prefer not tousethe term “scanning 10SS, ” and ifabasic standard ofreference isdeemed desirable wewould choose, onlogical grounds, thesingle A-scope trace, which contains alltheinfor- mation normally available from asingle pulse transmission.
With 44 THERADAR EQUATION [SEC.
2.11 respect tothis standard allother modes ofindication provide varying amounts ofstorage gain,bymaking use, more orless imperfectly tobe sure, ofinformation gathered onrepeated pulse transmissions.
Thus we say that Fig.
2.8describes theeffect ofscanning onstorage gain.
The number ofother independent variables, yetunmentioned, which affect the amount ofgain realized through storage isappallingly large.
The more prominent ofthese must bediscussed briefly, ifonly tosuggest the scope ofthegeneral problem treated comprehensively inVol.

The videobandwidth b,asdistinguished from thei-fbandwidth ~,has hitherto been assumed tobesogreat astoallow reproduction ofthe detected i-fsignal without distortion.
This isseldom true inpractice and the question arises, how does the video bandwidth influence the signal discernibility y,and how narrow can itbewithout harm? Making thevideo bandwidth bconsiderably less than I/ramounts toputting the rectified signals and noise through along-time-constant filter.
This isa sort ofaveTaging, orintegration process, ineffect, thefinal output atany instant being anaverage over several adjacent intervals, each oftheorder ofrinduration.
Itisclearly anintegration process operating ataloss rather than atagain,incontrast tothe sweep-to-sweep integration discussed earlier, foritincludes with the signal anunnecessarily large amount ofnoise.
The result isanincrease insignal power required for detection: forb<<l/T, S~,.
isroughly proportional tol/v’~.
Ofcourse such adecrease invideo bandwidth isaccompanied byamarked deterio- ration inthe time discrimination, orresolution inrange,ofthe system unless therange resolution isalready limited byother factors.
Because ofthis, and forother reasons aswell, designers have usually aimed at adequately wide video bands.
Actually, theeffect ofvideo bandwidth narrowing would not deserve even this much discussion here, were itnot that, inaless obvious way, avery similar effect arises from certain other influences, having todo with the spotsizeand the sweep speed.
Let usconsider anintensity- modulated indicator tube, such asthe PPI.
Let dbethe diameter of the light spot due tothe beam, and letvbethe speed with which the beam isswept across theface ofthetube.

Propagation over aReflecting Surface.
-If the transmission path lies near areflecting surface itmay bepossible forenergy toreach the target, and hence also forscattered energy toreturn tothe radar antenna, byway ofthesurface aswell asdirectly.
The result ofcombin- ingthe direct and the reflected wave atthe target will depend onthe relative intensity and phase ofthe reflected wave, which inturn will depend notonly onthedifference inthelength ofthetwo paths but upon changes ofphase orintensity intreduced inthe process ofreflection.

2.12 The maxima and minima which one might have expected inthe nearer region arenot conspicuous inFig.
2.12.
The reason forthis is that thetarget was notapoint with aunique height hzbut acomplicated object extending from thesurface uptosome maximum height.
Inthis “near zone” some parts ofthe ship lieonmaxima and some lieinthe nulls, and the net result atany instant issome sort ofaverage, in thefluctuations ofwhich one could hardly expect todiscern traces ofthe regular interference pattern predicted byEq.

The absence ofa sharply defined break inthe curve between the two regions isreadily justified onthe same grounds.
The location ofthebreak, ill-defined as itis,can however beused tocompute some “effective height” hz.

Inmany instances, especially atmicrowave frequencies, this limit occurs sosoon after the beginning ofthe eighth- power region astoreduce thelatter torather inconsequential size.
Before we discuss the effect ofthe earth’s curvature, we should comment oncertain other, less important, shortcomings ofthepreceding simplified argument.
For one thing, wehave ignored the fact that the reflecting suface isnot smooth; even inthecase ofthesea, theirregulari- ties (waves) areboth wide and deep compared toamicrowavelength; in the case ofaland surface, wemay beconfronted with any imaginable irregularity.
Nevertheless, atleast forreflection onthe sea atnearly grazing incidence, the observed reflection coefficient israther close to what aglassily smooth sea would give.
1This is,perhaps, nomore surprising than the fact that anordinary piece ofpaper displays, at nearly grazing incidence, specular reflection oflight, and itcan bemade plausible bysome argument such asthis: InFig.
2.13, two parallel rays, ABand DE,strike a“rough” surface, the roughness consisting ofa single bump ofheight h.
The reader will find with little trouble that the netpath difference between thetwo rays ~F—ABisjust 2hsinO.If IThereflection coefficient would have tobesubstantially lessthan 1tochange the result significantly, sofarastheradar problem isconcerned.

But M<Aimplies h<A/t), and if 0issmall, bumps which areactually large compared tokcanbetolerated.
Something like this may occur insome circumstances over land.
Indeed, reflection hasbeen observed onunusually flat terrain, such asan airfield, atmicrowave frequencies.
Except insuch unusual circumstances there isvery little evidence ofground reflection atwavelengths of10cm orless.
For microwaves, then, the results ofthis section are almost wholly restricted totransmission over water atnearly grazing incidence.

The Round Earth.-The distance Rhtothe optical horizon, from anobserver situated hfeet above the surface ofaspherical earth ofdiameter Doftwould begiven bythe formula, Rh=V’DO.hifthe atmosphere didnot bend therays oflight.
Actually, theearth’s atmos- phere decreases indensity with height, introducing adownward curvature inallrays, which allows aray toreach somewhat beyond the distance given bythe above formula.
For rays ofsmall inclination tothe hori- zontal, and forheights small compared tothethickness oftheatmosphere, this effect can betaken into account byreplacing the true diameter of the earth byasomewhat larger number D.11.How much larger itis depends ontherate ofchange with height oftheindex ofrefraction ofthe atmosphere.
This effect may beexpected toshow local variations.
A reasonable choice ofa”standard” condition leads toavalue R.~r=1.33R0, and thence, thanks toafortuitous numerical relation between units, to aneasily remembered formula forthedistance totheradar horizon, R,(statute miles) =~2h (feet).
(32) The formula Eq.
(32) predicts asomewhat greater horizon distance than does thecorresponding formula fortheopticalhorizon, because the conditions assumed as“standard” include amoderate gradient ofwater- vapor concentration.
Water vapor, although ithasbut aminor influence ontheatmospheric refraction ofvisible light, displays avery pronounced refractive effect atallradio frequencies, including microwave frequencies.
This effect, caused bythe permanent electric moment ofthe water molecule, can, insome circumstances, drasti tally affect the propagation ofmicrowaves inamanner tobedescribed inthenext section.
Confining ourattention forthemoment totheatmosphere of“stand- ard” refractive properties, towhich Eq.
(32) applies, letusseewhy it makes sense tospeak ofamicrowave horizon when radiation ofmuch lower frequency, asiswell known, travels farbeyond any such horizon.
Inthe first place, the ionosphere does not, toany appreciable degree, reflect orrefract microwaves.
Inthe second place, the spreading of waves around the curved surface ofthe earth, essentially bydiflruction, ismuch reduced atmicrowave frequencies because the wavelength isso 54 THERADAR EQUATION [SEC.
213 small compared with the size ofthe obstacle, toput itvery crudely.
There issome spreading ofthis sort, ofcourse, and itisaphenomenon upon which agood deal oftheoretical effort hasbeen expended.
Methods have been developed forcalculating theintensity oftheradiation inthe “diffraction region,” that is,beyond thehorizon (Vol.
13,Chap.
2).
In this region, however, the field strength normally diminishes sorapidly with increasing range that any additional radar coverage thus obtained isoflittle value.
From the point ofview oftheradar designer, targets over thehorizon might aswell beregarded astotally inaccessible under ‘1standard” conditions ofpropagation.
D,stanceinmales FIG,2.14.—Coverage diagram for2600 Me/see, transmitter height 120ft.Solid curve for totally reflecting earth.
Dotted curve fornonreflecting earth..
Asforregions well within the horizon, the curvature ofthe earth at most complicates thegeometry oftheinterference problem discussed inthe preceding section.
Naturally, wehave noright toapply Eq.
(29), asit stands, totargets near thehorizon.
Weneed notconcern ourselves here with these complications, which are adequately treated inVol.

Methods have been worked outforrapidly calculating thefield strength over acurved reflecting earth.
The radar designer usually prefers to display theresults intheform ofacoverage diagram, which shows contours ofconstant field strength plotted incoordinates contrived toshow directly the effect ofthe curvature ofthe earth.
One such contour, shown in Fig.
2.14, iscalculated foranomnidirectional antenna transmitting at 2600 Me/see from aheight of120 ftabove atotally reflecting earth.
The dotted curve isthecorresponding contour with anonreflecting earth.
Both contours would usually bemodified bythedirectional pattern ofthe SEC.2.14] SUPERREFRAC TION 55 radar antenna and itisnot difficult totake this into account inthe calculation.
Note theexaggeration ofthevertical scale.
Acontour ofconstant field strength isacontour ofconstant power intensity aswell; moreover, the intensity ofthe signal received from a radar target ofgiven cross section, located anywhere along such acontour, isthesame.1 Thus, iftheproper contour ischosenit will represent, as nearly asany curve can, the boundary ofthe region inwhich agiven target can bedetected.
The reader’s earlier introduction tosome ofthe statistical factors involved inradar should prepare him forthe warning that such coverage diagrams arenotto betaken tooliterally.
They are, nevertheless, useful intheplanning and design oflong-range search radar.
2,14.
Superrefraction.-As wehave seen, the effect ofthe normal vertical gradient ofrefractive index inthe atmosphere istointroduce a slight downward curvature inthepath oflight and ofmicrowaves.
Were this curvature only afewtimes greater, itwould equal thecurvature ofthe earth itself, and itwould bepossible foraray tobend around the earth without leaving the surface; inother words, there would benohorizon.
Whatever misgivings wemay have about the use ofthe word “ray” in this connection, itwould not besurprising ifsome interesting departure from standard microwave propagation were tomanifest itself under such conditions.
Refractive index gradients oftherequisite strength (5parts in10sper ft)can beproduced under some conditions bytemperature gradients alone.
For example, ifland heated bythe sun cools byradiation at night, afairly thin layer ofcold (therefore dense) airmay beformed just above theground, which results inanunusually rapid decrease ofrefrac- tive index with height, the index ofthe lowest layer being abnormally great.
Amore widespread cause ofstrong vertical gradients inrefractive index, and therefore ofexcessive bending ofrays, isthe refractive effect ofwater vapor mentioned earlier.
Over most ofthesurface oftheocean theregion above the water isnot saturated with water vapor, whereas thelayer directly incontact with thewater must bevery nearly saturated.
There is,inother words, acontinual evaporation ofwater from the sea 10ne must becareful nottoconfuse thedirectional pattern ofanantenna with theplotofcontours ofconstant intensity inthefield oftheantenna, which itocca- sionally superficially resembles.
Ifweplot thegain ofanantenna asafunction of angle, inpolar coordinates, wehave anantenna pattern that hasmeaning, strictly) only iftheantenna isisolated inspace.
Ontheother hand, contours ofconstant intensity, thecoordinates ofwhich refer directly tOpOsitiOns insPace, canbeused tO describe theradiation field nomatter what thesurroundings ortype ofpropagation involved.
The factthat asignal ofthesame intensity isreceived from atarget at anyposition ononesuch contour does notdepend ontheinverse-square laworany other lawofpropagation butonly ontheReciprocity Theorem. 56 THERADAR EQUATION [SEC.
2.14 and adiffusion ofthe vapor upward into the overlying airmass.
This implies theexistence ofavertical gradient intheconcentration ofwater vapor with, normally, the highest concentration atthe surface and decreasing upward.
Atypical condition towhich such aneffect may lead isthat ofa relatively shallow layer just above thesurface withinwhich the vertical gradient ofrefractive index isnegative and exceeds the critical value of 5parts in10’perft.
Such aregion iscalled a“duct” forreasons that will appear shortly, and thelevel atwhich thegradient hasjustthecritical value iscalled the “top oftheduct.
”Were wetotrace thepath ofan initially horizontal ray atthis level, wewould find itcurving downward just enough tokeep upwith the curvature ofthe earth, and therefore maintaining constant height.
Farther down inthe duct, where the gradient isstronger, itwould bepossible foraray launched ataslight upward inclination tobebent back tothe surface again and thus to proceed byaseries ofbounces, trapped asitwere, within theduct.
From this temptingly graphic picture ofpropagation within aduct itiseasy todraw false conclusions.
Since thedescription oftheprocess interms ofrays, traced bythe rules ofgeometrical optics, nowhere involves the wavekngth ofthe radiation, weshould beled toexpect similar effects atallfrequencies forwhich theindex ofrefraction has the same value, namely forallradio frequencies.
But, actually, ducts such aswehave described have noobservable eflectonthepropagation oflow- frequency radio waves.
The reason forthis isthat theduct iseffective in“trapping” and guiding radiation only ifthewavelength isless than some critical value determined bytheheight ofthe duct and the steep- ness ofthe gradient ofrefractive index within the duct.
The ducts which wehave described have nogreat vertical extent, their heights being ofthe order ofafew tens, oratthe most afew hundreds, offeet; their influence onpropagation isusually confined tofrequencies inthe 1000-M c/sec range and above.’ For gradients inrefractive index which would not beunusual inthese surface ducts over water, the relation between height ofduct and thelongest wavelength strongly affected by theduct issuggested bythefigures inTable 2.3.

Nor does the source ofradiation have toliewithin theduct topermit aportion oftheenergy tobepartially trapped inthe duct, although itmay not betoo farabove it.
The variation offield strength with distance from thetransmitter and height above thesurface isvery complicated, and tocover this type ofpropagation byamere modification oftheradar equation isentirely out ofthe question, asthe reader who pursues this subject into Vol.

Itisperhaps best here tosummarize theaspects ofsuper- rcfraction which have asignificant bearing onradar planning and design.
1.The guiding ofmicrowaves byrefractive anomalies ofthe duct type appears tobethesole means bywhich coverage beyond thehorizon can beobtained.

Attenuation ofMicrowaves inthe Atmosphere.—The earth’s atmosphere, excluding the ionosphere, isfor all practical purposes transparent toradio waves offrequency lower than 1000 llc/sec.
Even over atransmission path hundreds ofmiles long noappreciable fraction oftheenergy intheradio wave islost byabsorption orscattering inthe atmosphere.
With theextension oftheuseful range ofradio frequencies into themicrowave region wehave atlast entered apart 01theelectro- magnetic spectrum towhich the atmosphere isnot wh011ytransparent.
Indeed anupper limit tofrequencies useful forradar, imposed bythe properties ofthe atmosphere, isnow within sight.
The radar engineer must therefore acquaint himself with certain phenomena falling hereto- fore within theexclusive province ofthemolecular spectroscopist.
Broadly speaking, there are two ways inwhich energy can bedis- sipated from aradar beam: (1)bydirect absorption ofenergy inthe gases ofthe atmosphere; (2)through absorption orscattering ofenergy bycondensed matter such aswater drops.
Allsuch processes lead toan exponential decrease ofintensity with distance from the source, super- imposed on,and eventually dominating, theiu~erse-square dependence. SEC.215] ATTENUATION OFMICROWAVES 59 The effect istherefore truly anattenuation inthesense inwhich theword isapplied totransmission lines, and isproperly measured indecibels per kilometer.
We shall discuss first the absorption bythe gases ofthe atmosphere.
Ofthe three abundant gases ofthe atmosphere—nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor—the latter two areintrinsically capable ofinteracting with and absorbing energy from aradio wave byvirtue ofthepermanent electric dipole moment ofthe water molecule and the permanent mag- neticdipole moment ofthe oxygen molecule.
We know, however, that molecules absorb radiation inmore orless well-defined absorption lines, orbands, and wehave toinquire whether either ofthese molecules exhibits absorption lines inthemicrowave range—that is,atfrequencies much lower than those usually associated with molecular absorption spectra.
Ithas been found that both oxygen and water vapor doinfact dkplay such absorption.
Although the effects observed would be classed asvery weak %yaspectroscopist, radar involves transmission over such long paths that very serious attenuation isencountered in certain parts ofthe spectrum.
InFig.
2.16 areplotted curves showing thecourse ofthe water vapor absorption and oxygen absorption, asa function ofwavelength.
The absorption ismeasured bythe rate of attenuation indecibels perkilometer.
The most prominent feature ofthewater-vapor absorption isasingle “line” which appears asabroad maximum centered about 1.3-cm wavelength, superimposed onthe residual effect ofamultitude offar stronger li~es located atmuch shorter wavelengths.
The soiid part of thecurve isbased onextensive direct measurements.
These confirmed themain features ofthe theoretical predictions,l onthe basis ofwhich theremainder ofthe curve has been sketched in;one cannot, however, rely onthequantitative accuracy ofthe dotted part ofthe curve.
The curve isplotted foranatmosphere containing 10gofwater vapor per cubic meter.
This corresponds toaFelative humidity of66per cent atatemperature of18°C, forexample.
Over the range ofabsolute humidities normally encountered inthe atmosphere one may assume that the attenuation issimply proportional tothe absolute humidity.
The rapid rise ofthe curve below 3mm isevidence ofthe powerful absorption displayed bywater vapor throughout the farinfrared.
No further transparent regions aretobefound until wereach awavelength oftheorder of15microns (0.0015 cm).
The oxygen absorption rises toahigh peak at5-mm wavelength; this has been quantitatively verined bydirect measurement.

Water drops inthe atmosphere can affect the passage ofmicrowave radiation intwo ways.
Inthefirst place liquid water isavery imperfect dielectric atmicrowave frequencies, and absorbs energy from anoscillat- ingelectric field just asany 10SSY dielectric WOuld.

1The effect oflarger drops ismore complicated, depending not only upon the total mass of water perunit volume, but upon thediameter ofthedrops aswell.
The absorption process itself isnolonger simple, and scattering ofenergy by the drops, which depends very strongly onthe ratio ofwavelength to drop diameter, begins toplay arole.
Energy scattered out ofthe directed beam must, ofcourse, becounted aslost.

The most extensive analysis ofthis sort has been carried out byJ.W.and D.Ryde, upon \vhose~\,ork' thecurves ofFig.

The direct measurements ofattenuation and rainfall which ha~’e been made confirm these predictions satisfactorily.
The chief difficulty insuch experiments isconnected with themeasurement oftherainfall, which ishomogeneous inneither time nor space.
The dashed curves ofFig.

For theconditions towhich Curve fapplies, forexample, theoptical range islimited toabout 400 ft.
Atawavelength of3mm the radar range could be50to100 times as long, Itwould beeasy, butnotvery instructive, tointroduce anexponential factor into the radar equation totake account ofthe attenuation that wehave been discussing.
}Ve leave this task tothe reader, \rho will find nodifficulty incalculating, forany given case, thereduction inrange caused byaspecified strength ofattenuation, which iseffective, of course, onboth theoutgoing and return path.
One general observation should bemade, however, which isthat theeffect ofanexponential term inthe radar equation isinsignificant atvery short ranges but over- whelming atvery long ranges.
What wemean byshortand longis determined bytherate ofattenuation.
Anentirely arbitrary criterion, \rhich will serve aswell asany other fordiscussion, istherange for\vhich thepresence oftheatmospheric attenuation just doubles thenormal rate ofdecrease ofsignal intensity with range.
Ifaistherate ofattenuation indb/km, the range ROsodefined isgiven byRo=8.68/a km.
At shorter ranges than this the inverse-square la~v isthe more important factor; atranges greater than R,the exponential factor controls the situation and any slight improvement inrange must bebought atenor- mous price.
Inother words, once attenuation takes hold, itisoflittle avail tostruggle against it.

Theoretical considerations which incertain cases will allow theprediction ofthevalue ofthese quantities from theknown properties (shape, material) ofthetarget will bepresented inthis chapter.
The following considerations will berestricted tocases where the indi- vidual target issufficiently small, compared with the distance from the transmitter, topermit theincident electromagnetic field atthetarget to beapproximated byaplane wave propagating inthe direction ofthe target away from the transmitter; this ischosen asthe zdirection.

3.5] THE CORNER REFLECTOR 67 3.5.
The Corner Reflector.
-It isoften desirable tomake acompact radar target with alarge cross section.
Aflat plate ofdimensions large compared toaw-avelength exhibits alarge cross section when viewed along itsnormal, because ofspecular reflection, but thecross section falls offsharply inother directions [see Eqs.
(7)and (8), Sec.
3.4].
The problem ofdesigning atarget that will give strong specular reflection for almost any direction ofillumination has been solved bytaking over into microwave radar practice thecorner reflector familiar inoptics.
The small glass reflectors usedin highway markers work onthis principle.
Acorner reflector consists ofthree mutually perpendicular intersecting planes (Fig.
3.2cL).
Ifabeam isdirected into the corner formed bythe planes, triple reflections occur which send itback inthe direction from (a) (b) FIG.32.-Tl1e triangular COI’UCV reflector.
which itcame (Fig.
3.2b).
The effective area fortriple reflection depends onthedirection in\vhich the corner isviewed, but itislarge over most ofthe octant inwhich asingle corner iseffective.
When the area for triple reflection grows small, double reflection (from two planes whose line ofintersection isnear]Y normal totheline ofsight) and single reflec- tion (from aplane nearly normal tothe line ofsight) begin tomake important contributions totheradar cross section.
Asingle corner will beeffective only fordirections ofillumination that cover one octant ofa sphere centered atthereflector, ashas been remarked; but alldirections can becovered bymakinga cluster ofeight such corners (Fig.
3.3).
Wecan find thecross section foracorner byconsidering itequivalent toa flatreflecting plate whose area istheeffective area ofthecorner for triple reflection.
Equation (7)gives, forarea .-landwavelengthk, the cross section 4TA ‘ ‘= A’” The maximum area fortriple reflection ~vill bethat afforded bythecorner tlhen itis~-ieived along itsaxis ofsymmetry.
This maximum area is that ofthe wgular hexagon formed bycutting offthe rorners ofthe projection ofthecorner onitsaxis ofsymmetry; itisgiven by 68 PROPERTIES OFRADAR TARGETS A~nx =~.

This yields forthe section 47ra4 ‘m” =3F’[SEC.

Figure 3.4 shows the maximum cross section atvarious radar frequencies asa function ofedge length.
Asa/X (and consequently thegain ofacorner reflector) isincreased, greater attention must bepaid tothe mechanical construction ofthereflector.
When the angle between one pair ofplanes differs from 90°, the triply reflected re- turn from the corner splits into two divergent beams, with acon- 1,~ Edge(a)ofcomer incm FIG.

Iftwo angles are inerror, there are four beams; ifallthree angles are wrong, sixbeams result.
The theory ofthe effect oferrors’ yields the result that aloss inreturned signal of3dbiscaused byadisplacement oftheouter edge ofthecorner ofabout A/2.
This limitation requires extremely close attention tothe mechanical construction ofcorner reflectors ofhigh gain.
Italso presents thepossibility ofapplying modulation tothereflection from acorner by slight motion ofone side.

3.7] USEOFABSORBENT MA1’ERIALS 69 approach.
Atarget consisting oftwoplanes intersecting atright angles gives specular reflection foralldirections ofobservation perpendicular to theline ofintersection.
Acylinder standing perpendicular ona plane is also strongly visible formost directions ofapproach.
Iftheproblem is, onthecontrary, toconstruct atarget with alow radar cross section for most directions ofapproach, such configurations must beavoided.
Furthermore, toeliminate ordinary specular reflection, surfaces perpen- dicular tothe probable directions ofobservation must beeliminated.
Partial camouflage oftargets has been achieved byproper shaping.
3“7.
Use ofAbsorbent Materials.—The possibility ofreducing the radar cross section bytheuseofmaterials absorbent atradar frequencies hasbeen thesubject ofconsiderable investigation.
Contributions tothe cross section can beseparated roughly into two parts.
The first arises from flat orgently curved surfaces ofconsiderable area (insquare wave- lengths) which arenormal totheline joining thetarget and transmitter.
Radiation returned from such surfaces may beproperly classed asspecular reflection; cross sections arising therefrom willbereferred toas“specular cross sections.
”Ifany dimension ofthe target issmaller than awave- length, orifthebackward radiation arises from thesecondary maxima in thediffraction pattern, thecross section will bereferred toasa“diffrac- tion cross section.
”When both types ofbackward scattering arepresent, thespecular cross section isusually much greater.
Inconsidering theuse ofabsorbent materials, this distinction must always beborne inmind.
The theory that follows isapplicable only tospecularly reflected radiation, and therefore tothespecular cross section.
Absorbers ingeneral areoftwo types.
Inthe first kind, reflections occurring atthe front surface oftheabsorber arecanceled bydestructive interference with the wave that enters the layer and subsequently reemerges.
This type, analogous tothe antireflection coatings applied tooptical lenses, will bereferred toas“interference absorbers.
”Inthe second kind, thematerial oftheabsorber issodesigned that noreflection takes place atthe front surface and the attenuation inthe layer extin- guishes the entering wave.
Acontinuous gradation from one kind of absorber totheother exists.
Consider the reflection from aninfinite plane sheet ofmaterial that ischaracterized byacomplex dielectric constant cand acomplex magnetic permeability y~.

Ifthe plate iscovered with absorbing material ofhigh refractive index, theprincipal diffraction maximum isgreatly reduced whereas thesecond- ary maximum isingeneral only slightly changed.
Covering the plate with magnet icmaterial oflow refractive index not only reduces the principal diffraction maximum, but also makes the secondary maxima considerably lower.
Generally speaking, material ofhigh refractive index can beexpected toreduce thespecular cross section while itleaves thediffraction cross section substantially unaltered.
Magnetic material oflow refractive index may, however, also effect areduction inthe diffraction cross section.
COMPLICATED TARGETS BY A.J.F.SIEGERT AND E.M.
PURCELL Most targets aremuch more complicated than those dealt with inthe previous sections.
Adistinction will bemade between ‘‘complex targets” and “compound targets” (Sec.
310).
The latter term denotes targets consisting ofmany independent elements (rain, vegetation) which generally fillthe volume illuminated bya“pulse packet” (Sec.
4.2) completely.
The former denotes complicated targets (such asships, air- craft, and structures) which arelarge, butstill smaller than theilluminated region.
The power received from compound targets isthus dependent onbeamwidth and pulse length, since these govern the size ofthe pulse packet; thesignal from acomplex target isnot.

Compound Targets Extended through Space.—Targets such as rain, vegetation, 6’window,’” orthe surface ofthe sea are much more complicated than thetargets considered inthepreceding sections.
Itis, however, easier topredict and verify certain features ofthe return from such targets because thecompound targets here considered arecomposed oflarge numbers ofindependent individual scatterers, and for that reason statistical considerations can beused intheir treatment.
The aim ofthis statistical treatment istopredict the probability distribution ofthereturned power and ofthecorrelat ionofsuccessive measurements ofthereturn power.
Itwill beuseful todistinguish between compound targets distributed throughout avolume (rain, “window”) and those distributed over a surface (vegetation, waves).
Inthis section thefirst class isconsidered, the second being deferred toSec.
3.11.
TheRain-echo Problem.—Echoes fmm rain are frequently observed onmicrowave radar (Fig.
3012).
Under some circumstances, the ability tomap out storm areas byradar may beput togood use.
Inmany applications, however, the presence onthe radar screen ofstorm echoes (that is,echoes from rain drops within astorm area) isobjectionable for either oftwo reasons.
(1)Asmall isolated storm cloud atlong range may bemistaken foralegitimate target; airborne sea-search radar is especially vulnerable tothis kind ofconfusion.
(2)Echoes from astorm area may mask orconfuse theechoes from targets atthesame range and azimuth.
The nuisance of“rain clutter,” which the latter effect issometimes called, ismost severe when the radar cross section ofthe desired target issmall.
Other factors that determine the intensity ofthe rain echo relative tothat ofthetarget echo arethebeamwidth, pulse length, and }ravelength oftheradar, thedistance tothetarget, and thenumber and size ofthewater drops intheneighborhood ofthetarget.

The latter effect makes the detection ofadesired target echo within therain clutter even more difficult, forthevery persistence ofthetarget echo onsuccessive pulses helps greatly todistinguish itfrom noise (Sec.
2.10).
Such help isofnoavail against rain unless the target echo isreceived over atime long compared tothe rain fluctuation period discussed above.
Todistinguish atarget inthe midst ofrain clutter, wemust make use ofsome peculiar feature ofaraindrop asaradar target.
One such feature, perhaps the only one unique torain, isthat the raindrops are round; thus the intensity and phase ofthe reflection from asingle drop donot depend onthe direction inwhich theincident beam ispolarized.
This cannot besaid ofmost radar targets, which, being complicated objects usually not rotationally symmetrical about the line ofsight, show very large variations, with polarization, ofthe total (complex) reflection coefficient.
Anexperimental verification ofthe theory that this property ofsymmetry which ispeculiar toraindrops can beused todistinguish atarget signal inthemidst ofrain clutter hasbeen carried out.
J“ery briefly, theprinciple isthis: ifasphere isstruck byacircularl,v polarized plane wave, formed bypassing alinearly polarized plane wave through aquarter-~vave plate, zthescattered wave observed intheback- ‘There areotherminordifferences: thelengthinrange ofa“noise spot” isdeter- rniaed bythereceiver bandwidth andthecathode-ray-tube spot size.

Ifthese surfaces were oriented inrandom directions, the probability yoffinding one atjust the right orientation would besolow that theaverage signal from such agroup offlatsurfaces would benostronger than theaverage signal from acollection ofisotropic scatterers filling about the same volume.
Therefore the flat surfaces must besooriented that the reflection isconcentrated inthe direction oftheradar receiver.
Inagroup ofbuildings, alarge proportion ofthe flat surfaces will bevertical walls, while many others aresmooth pave- ments orflat roofs.
There aremany opportunities forcombinations of three flat surfaces atright angles toform corner reflectors (Sec.
3.5), which arehighly retredirect ivetargets.
The full potentialities ofthese tremendous corner reflectors are never realized inpractice because of the strict tolerances imposed bythe short wavelengths ofmicrowave radar.
Insufficient flatness inthe walls makes ahuge, imperfect corner reflector behave like one which issmaller but perfect.
Inadequate perpendicularity results inseveral return beams inthe vicinity ofthe aircraft instead ofasingle return beam pointed directly atthe aircraft.
Nevertheless, the average effect ofmany triple corners istoprovide retrodirectivity intheradar target.
Vertical and horizontal surfaces can combine into double (rather than triple) corners, giving directivity inelevation under certain con- ditions.
Itwas shown inSec.
2.12 that rough surfaces like the ground can serve assatisfactory mirrors formore distant targets when theangle ofincidence issufficiently low.
Because double-corner directivity depends onthe mirror-like properties ofahorizontal surface infront of vertical structures, weshould expect strongest signals from these struc- tures when they areseen from low angles.
Many buildings orgroups of buildings return strong signals atlong ranges but tend tofade atshorter ranges when the higher angle ofincidence reduces their retrodirectivity.
Ifthe line ofsight isnearly horizontal, strong signals are sometimes observed bydirect specular reflection from vertical surfaces without the benefit ofmirror reflection from’ anintermediate horizontal surface.
Special cases oftarget directivity inazimuth arise when, forinstance, large groups ofbuildings have parallel walls.
The signals indirections perpendicular tothese walls are often intensified, ascan beseen in Fig.

PURCELL To athoughtful observer, one ofthe most striking features ofa microwave radar screen isthe quantity ofinformation that isavailable ataglance and continually being renewed.
Insome installations the map ofanarea ofmany thousands ofsquare miles isdrawn every few seconds.
Such amap may comprise ineffect some 105to106separate “elements” ofinformation similar tothe elements from which atele- vision picture orahalf-tone cutisconstructed.
This initself isnocause forcomplacency; anordinary photograph, recorded inafraction ofa second, usually contains much more information.
Indeed, the unini- tiated, comparing therather fuzzy radar picture with thepin-point detail ofthe photograph, may conclude that the obvious deficiencies ofthe former merely betray theprimitive state oftheart, and that vast improve- ment indistinctness ofdetail istobeexpected inthe normal course of development.
These conclusions are only partly true.
Inthe first place many ofthe unique capabilities ofradar, such asdirect range measurement ordetection ofvery remote objects despite cloud and dark- ness, often deserve more emphasis inradar design than does the ability ofthe settoproduce alifelike picture.
Inthe second place, the pulse radar process issubject tocertain inherent limitations.
These limitations areofobvious origin.
Afew have been mentioned already inpreceding chapters, but since the interest there was merely inthe detection of energy reflected from asingle target and not inover-all radar system design, their implications were not pursued.
4.1.
Range, Pulse-repetition Frequency, and Speed ofScan—It is thefunction ofmost radar sets tosearch continually through some region inspace byscanning.
Naturally the radar designer strives always to enlarge the region which can thus besearched, toincrease the rapidity with which itcan becompletely explored, and toimprove theability to distinguish detail within the region.
Inthis endeavor heismade acutely aware oftwo ofthefundamental limitations ofpulse radar which canbeblamed respectively onthefinite velocity oflight and thenecessity offunneling allinformation insequence through asingle electrical channel.
The effect ofthese two limitations and the close connection between them can beseen inasimple example.

Ifitissupposed that aradar setoperates with apulse-recurrence frequency of500 pps, during the 2000-psec interval following each pulse echoes will bereceived from objects within arange of186 miles.
Atarget 250 miles away may, however, return asignal strong enough tobe detected.
Ifitdoes, this signal will arrive 690 psec after thenext trans- mitted pulse, inexact imitation ofanecho from atarget at64miles Todecide how serious acomplication the possibility ofa“second time around echo, ”asitiscalled, presents, two cases must becarefully distinguished.
1.Targets beyond 186 miles are not ofinteresL The second-time- around echo isanuisance only.
Itwould bewell toget rid ofitifthere were some way todoso;ifthere isnot, itwould be desirable toidentify itasaninterloper.
2.The extension ofcoverage beyond 186 miles isforsome reason important.
Echoes from targets beyond that range constitute valuable information that ought tobesorted out and presented unambiguous y.
IfCase 1applies, the difficulty can hardly beregarded asfunda- mental.
For one thing, there are several ways inwhich the echo in question can beidentified asoriginating from the preceding pulse.
The useofaslightly irregular pulse-recurrence rate, forinstance, will prevent overlapping ofsuccessive echoes ofthis type from the same target, without affecting the superposition ofechoes from atarget lying within therange limit defined above.
Ifamore powerful remedy isneeded, the unwanted echoes can beremoved altogether bysome such scheme as thefollowing one.
The frequency ofthetransmitter maybe changed for each pulse, with acorresponding shift inthe frequency ofthe local oscillator ofthe receiver.
For example, the transmitter frequency— that is,the, carrier frequency—might alternate between two values, ~1 and jz,separated byafrequency interval greater than the receiver pass band.
Echoes originating from thefirst transmitted pulse, atfrequency j,,would not beamplified ifreceived during the interval following the second pulse, forduring this interval the receiver would beintune only forechoes offrequency j,,and soon.
This rather clumsy expedient, although itisactually feasible, would scarcely bejustified solely asa means ofavoiding areduction inpulse-repetition frequency.
Itismen- tioned only toshow that objectionable second time around, oreven “nth time around, ”echoes could beeliminated ifnecessary without reduction inPRF and without adrastic change intheradar process. 118 LIMITATIONS OF PULSE RADAR [SEC.
41 The situation isdifferent inCase 2,forifitisrequired toreceive both first- and second-time echoes, toseparate out the latter, and topresent them inproper relation toarange scale, some method must beused which isthe equivalent ofoperation ontwo ormore frequency channels simultaneously.
Various schemes tocircumvent such operation may occur tothe ingenious mind, but close examination will show that each iseither tantamount tomultichannel operation 1orinvolves some sacrifice inperformance through anabnormally wide pass band, incomplete usc ofavailable time, orthelike.
Supposing that thereader accepts, with more orless reservation, the force ofithe range-PRF restriction, weproceed with the example, in which the PRF is500 pps and the range limit isaccordingly 186 miles.
Suppose that the width ofthe radar beam inazimuth iseffect~vely 1°, and that the ope~ation required isasearch through 360° inaz.inuth by rotation oftheantenna.
Clearly, iftheantenna turns atarate exceeding 500° per see, during one revolution some narrow sectors inthe region to becovered will fail tobeilluminated.
We therefore conclude that the shortest possible time inwhich the area can besearched is%+$ or0.72 sec.
Iftherate ofrotation were much faster than 1/0.72 secor1.4rps, aretentive screen could beused toaccumulate information over several revolutions until allgaps were filled.
butthetime forcollecting acomplete picture would again be0.72 secorlonger.
Asamatter offact, rotation atarate higher than 1.4rpsisruled out byquite another consideration.
Inorder toreceive anecho from the target, the antenna must point toward the target with anaccuracy measured bythe beamwidth.
Ataspeed of1.4rps, inthe present example, this requirement isalready jeopardized since the antenna will have rotated through just 1°between thetransmission ofapulse and the arrival ofthe corresponding echo from atarget attherange limit.
The extreme limiting conditions which have been assumed allow any target tobestruck byonepulse ofenergy, atmost, within thetime ofone complete searching cycle, orscan.
InChap.
2itwas pointed out that theminimum detectable signal power depends sensitively onthenumber ofechoes from thesame target which can beaccumulated and integrated.
The reduction inSm,n purchased atthe price ofincreased scanning time byallowing thebeam todwell inthetarget forseveral pulse intervals, is almost always worth the cost.
The number ofpulses striking thetarget during one scan isanimpor- tant parameter inradar design which will reappear frequently inlater 1The useofdifferent directions ofpokv-ization asan~cans ofdistinguishing one arriving signal from another suggests itself immediately.

Any considerable improvement inall three characteristics—range, scanning speed, and angular resolution— will beblocked byirreconcilable requirements aslong asasingle radar set isrelied upon for the entire coverage.
But the restriction falls even more severely onradar systems designed tosearch rapidly iritwo angular coordinates rather than inone.
Suppose that itisour ambition todesign aradar system which will locate inazimuth, elevation, and range any aircraft within 20miles with the angular accuracy that can beachieved through the use ofa beam 2°wide inboth azimuth and elevation.
The solid angle which the beam itself includes isroughly 0.001 steradlans whereas thehemis- phere tobesearched represents asolid angle of27r.
Some 6000” patches” inthe sky must therefore becovered.
The number ofradar pulses needed during acomplete scanning operation, regardless ofthe order inwhich itiscarried out, cannot beless than 6000 N...
The maximum pulse-recurrence frequency consistent with a20-mile rangez isabout 45OO pps.
Hence the minimum time forcompletion ofthe scanning operation is6000 N,~/4500 or1.3N.C sec.
Even ifN- ispermitted to beassmall as3,foracomplete picture ascanning time of4secisrequired, which formany purposes isuncomfortably long.
The only physical constant which has been invoked intheforegoing discussion isthe velocity oflight.
The only assumption which has been made about the radar system amounts tothis: There isonly one channel, through which elements ofinformation inthe form ofechoes IItshould benoted that imposing thisrestriction incidentally insures that the antenna willnotturn toofaraway from thedirection ofthetarget before theecho returns.

Itmust beconcluded that the restriction which thus arises can beovercome only bytheuse ofmultiple channels.
The simplest—at least inconception—and the most direct way todothis is touse two ormore radar systems, apportioning toeach apart ofthe region tobecovered.
This method isnot the only practical scheme for multichannel operation.

ofinformation provided isachieved inamore subtle and, under the circumstances, amore effective way.
The V-beam principle permits asingle scanning radar to give height as well as range and azimuth ofaircraft.
Inaddition tothevertical fanbeam which ischar- acteristic ofmicrowave search radar (cf.
Chap.
15), the V-beam set provides anadditional fan beam that isrotating atthe same speed and theplane ofwhich istilted outofthevertical.
Iftheazimuth and range ofatarget areknown from the first beam, the height can beinferred from thetime ofappearance ofthesame target inthesecond, or“slant” beam (see Fig.
4.1).
This latter beam isassociated with acompletely SEC.
4.2] POWER ANDINFORMATION RATE 121 separate transmitter and receiver.
The V-beam radar isthus anauthen- ticexample oftheuseofaseparate radar system toovercome ascanning speed limitation.
Inacertain sense, however, the use ofthe second channel inthis way more than doubles the number ofangular elements searched ina given time.
That istosay, anisolated target can relocated inazimuth and inelevation with anaccuracy that would ordinarily require asharp “pencil” beam.
But toscan the whole region with such apencil beam would take, according totheearlier discussion, avery much longer time.
Itmight therefore appear that the V-beam system eludes the very restrictions which have been claimed tobefundamental.
This istobe explained bythe fact that the V-beam height-finding method works only ifrelatively few targets appear onthescreen atone time; otherwise there isessential ambiguity inthe interpretation ofthe picture.
The system is,therefore, not fully equivalent toapencil-beam scan ofthe same angular region.
Actually more than two separate radar sets are involved inthe V-beam system, forboth thevertical and theslant beams arethemselves composite.
This, however, has nothing todowith the scanning speed limitation, but isrequired merely toget adequate range and vertical coverage.
Itisaconsequence, inother words, ofthe radar equation forfanbeams discussed inSec.

Bandwidth, Power, and Information Rate.—If aradar system were used tofind only the direction ofatarget, range information being suppressed, itwould beoperating very much like atelevision camera.
The picture soobtained would, ineffect, bedivided into anumber of elements equal tothe ratio ofthe total solid angle scanned tothe solid angle included inthebeam itself.
Thus thenumber ofpieces ofinforma- tion that the system can collect per second issimply the number of picture elements multiplied bythenumber ofcomplete scans persecond, exactly asintelevision.
Inthe radar system giving hemispherical coverage which was used asanexample inthe preceding section, this number comes to1500 elements persecond, which isnotvery impressive bytelevision standards.
The type Cindicator already mentioned in Sec.
2“11 and described inmore detail inSec.
6.6gives information of just this sort.
Ithas notfound wide usefort woreasons: (1)theaccom- panying increases inminimum detectable signal power, explained in Sec.
211, and (2)thefact that themethod discards alarge fraction ofthe information available intheradar system, therange information.
Aneven closer approach tothe television method has been visual- ized, inwhich the proposed radar receiving system isbuilt something like atelevision camera.

Asusual inc-w radar, knowledge oftarget range would not beafforded bysuch asystem without further elaboration.

This conclusion, which has been approached byaroundabout way, isfamiliar tothecommunication engineer, whether heisconcerned with voice, facsimile, ortelevision transmission.
Let usseehow closely atypical radar system approaches this funda- mental limit.
Consider anairborne ground-mapping radar with a1.5° beamwidth and PRF of1800 pps, scanning at15rpm.
Suppose that thepulse duration is1psec and that aregion 30miles inradius ismapped onthe indicator screen.
Byalittle arithmetic itisfound that N,.
is 30inthis case and that the number ofseparate patches onthe ground that are examined in1secis18,000.
The product ofthese numbers, 540,000, istobecompared with thebandwidth ofthe system described, whloh would probably beabout 2Me/see.
The important point is that the numbers donot differ byorders ofmagnitude.
Itmust be said, however, that itisnotalways easy tomake fulluseontheindicator ofthe information available inthe radar system (cf.

Pulse Radar and C-w Radar.—The last section has abearing on the relative capabilities ofpulse radar and so-called “c-w radar,” by which ismeant asystem operating atrelatively low peak power, with avery narrow receiver pass band, and making use ofthe doppler prin- ciple, oroffrequency modulation.
Aswas explained ;nSec.
2.9, a reduction inpulse power, accompanied byacorresponding increase in pulse length and decrease inreceiver bandwidth, leaves the maximum range ofaradar system unaffected.
Proceeding toalimit inthis direc- tion, imagine thepulse tobemade solong that itfills thewhole interval, 124 LIMITATIONS OF PULSE RADAR [SEC.
4.4 l/v, long, which previously separated successive pulses.
Atthe same time the average power iskept constant byareduction inpulse power bythe factor rv,.
The receiver bandwidth, meanwhile, isreduced to about U,cps.
The result isessentially ac-wsystem insofaraspower and sensitivity areconcerned, with abandwidth ofv,.
Itcan seeasfaras the previous radar system, but itcannot seeasmuch inthe same time.
Unless itisprovided with multiple channels itcan collect information only atthe rate v,.
The reader must becautioned against taking too literally the result ofthe above argument, forthe hypothetical variation ofsystem param- eters cannot beduplicated inpractice.
Achange inpulse power, bya large factor, entails achange inthe type oftube used asatransmitter, and perhaps inother components aswell.
The radar designer, inother words, cannot adjust pulse duration arbitrarily, keeping average power constant; nor can the receiver pass band bemade arbitrarily narrow as~isincreased, foreffects such asfluctuations ofthe echo eventually impose alimit.
This problem will bediscussed indetail inthefollowing chapter which isconcerned specifically with c-w radar.
The general conclusion, however, remains valid—an essential advantage ofhigh pulse power, asused inpulse radar, isthat itpermits information tobe obtained rapidly.
For certain tasks, novery high information rate isrequired, and for such applications the various c-w methods (Chap.
5)deserve considera- tion.
Intheproblem oftheradio altimeter, forexample, what isrequired ismerely therange ofasingle, large, ever-present target—the earth below.
Itissignificant that the most important practical application ofc-w radar has been made inthis field.
4.4.
Clutter.-One ofthe most formidable limitations tothe useful- ness ofpulse radar until recently was that imposed by“clutter.” Often aradar system sees too much, rather than too little; the picture iscon- fused byunwanted echoes, orclutter.
This can bemade upofechoes from surrounding objects ontheground (ground clutter), ofechoes from theirregular surface ofthesea(sea clutter), oreven ofechoes from storm clouds.
The problem istofind the desired echo inthe midst ofthe clutter.
Although various palliative have been invented (Chap.
12) which accentuate afairly strong echo relative toadiffuse background of clutter, this difficulty isplainly fundamental aslong asthere isnoessen- tialdifference between theechoes that make uptheclutter and theechoes from what wemay choose tocall the true target.
How can the radar system distinguish between theechoes from boulders, ridges, trees, and a multitude ofirregularities ontheside ofahill, and theecho from atank moving down the hill? How can the periscope ofasubmarine beseen against thebackground ofechoes from aconsiderable area ofrough water? SEC.
44] CLUTTER 125 How can alow-flying plane betracked across aradar map filled with “permanent” echoes? The only basis that isknown foradistinction between the echoes from aparticular target and equally strong echoes from itsimmediate surroundings isthemotion, ifany, ofthetarget relative toitssurround- ings.
1The reflection ofawave byamoving object gives rise toasignal asreceived inthe neighborhood ofthe (stationary) transmitter, which differs slightly infrequency from theoutgoing wave.
This isthefamiliar doppler effect.
The frequency difference Ajisbut asmall fraction of the original frequency j.,inthe case ofelectromagnetic waves, being in fact (2u/c)fo where visthe velocity ofthe target along the line ofsight and cthevelocity oflight.
Doppler detection systems, or“c-w radar” asthey are sometimes loosely called, utilize this principle.
Infact the doppler effect and c-w radar were from the beginning soclosely identified astocreate arather widespread impression that pulse radar was inherently incapable of capitalizing onthis essential difference between fixed and moving targets.
This isnot true, fortunately, ashas been vividly demonstrated bythe development ofmethods, described inChap.
16,which make possible a distinction between moving targets and their surroundings.
Insome cases theechoes from thelatter areautomatically rejected.
This isaspectacular advance inpulse-radar technique but itdoes not entirely eliminate the clutter problem.
Itisapplicable only to moving targets, and then only when theunwanted echoes from the sur- roundings donot fluctuate sorapidly astodefeat the pulse-to-pulse comparison which isanessential part ofthescheme.
Another direction from which the clutter problem can beattacked isthat ofresolution.
Tojust this quality isdue thegreat advantage of microwave radar over long-wave radar inrespect toclutter.
Asthe radar beam ismade narrower and the pulse shorter, the amount of clutter signal superimposed on the target signal decreases.
Also, improved resolution often allows recognizable forms tobedistinguished intheradar picture.
Aroad orariver may beplainly discernible ona radar map even though any oneofthemany traces making upthepicture }~ould beundecipherable.
How far wecan hope togoinimproving resolution depends onfactors already discussed, namely the beamwidth- aperture-wavelength relation, considerations ofscanning speed, and the practical limits onpulse length and range resolution.
Within these limitations, however, there isstill much room fordevelopment.
1One exception tothisstatement must bemade.
Echoes from spherical water drops (rain clutter) accurately preserve thepolarization oftheincident wave, andit hasbeen demonstrated that rainclutter canbealmost entirely eliminated bymaking useofthisfact (Sec.
3.10), 126 LIMITATIONS OFPULSE RADAR [SEC.
4.4 The reader may well ask whether aphenomenon has been overlooked which could beused todistinguish some targets from others.
There appears tobenopossibility forsuch aphenomenon inthe elementary process ofreflection ofelectromagnetic waves from inhomogeneities inthe medium through which they travel.
Areturning wave ischar- acterized byfrequency (including phase), intensity, and polarization.
Iftwo targets within theradar beam—for example, atelephone pole and astationary man—produce echoes similar inthe respects listed, they are utterly indistinguishable, asmuch aswemight prefer tolabel one clutter and the other the true target.
Such echoes may very well beidentical inthe respects listed since nosignificant difference exists atthese fre- quencies between theelectromagnetic properties ofaman and those ofa piece ofwood.
Toput itanother way, thedimension of“color” isnot available because the radar cross section ofmost objects varies inno systematic way ,with frequency.
Distinction byshape, onthe other hand, ispossible only when the radar beam isconsiderably smaller in cross section than the object viewed. CHAPTER 5 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS BY W.

General Considerations.
-We shall begin with adiscussion that isfundamentally useful inunderstanding what follows, but has asits immediate object adefinition ofthe scope ofthis chapter more precise than isgiven bythechapter title.
The simplest conceivable radar system consists ofasource ofr-f power, anantenna, and ascattering object ortarget.
The antenna emits waves with time factor eh~, which, onstriking the target ata distance r,are reflected and returned tothe antenna, where their time factor will bee’(”’-’kr) with k=27r/A.
The returned waves will be reduced inamplitude byafactor awhich depends onthe target and various geometrical factors, asdiscussed inChaps.
2and 3.
This returned wave will give rise tocurrents and voltages inthe antenna, which add tothose produced bythe power source and sogive rise toavoltage-current ratio, orimpedance, which ischanged from the value existing ~vhen notarget ispresent.
Inprinciple, this impedance, orsome similar quantity, might be measured onanabsolute scale, and the deviations from the normal, or no-targrt value, ascribed tothepresence ofatarget.
Practically, this procedure isimpossible because thereturned signals areoften 10–9 times aslarge, onavoltage basis, asthe outgoing signals, with the result that the variations inimpedance might beofthe order ofapart in10’.
Such variations can hardly bemeasured inthelabora- tory atlowfrequencies, letalone inthefield and atmicrowave frequencies.
Itistherefore necessary tocause thereturned signals tovary insome manner sothat the variation can bemeasured, rather than toattempt such anabsolute measurement asthat described above.
This desired variation iscaused byamodulation process ofsome sort.
The word “modulation” isused herein ageneral sense toinclude changes induced bythe target aswell aschanges insignal introduced atthe transmitter.
Allpossible radar systems canthen beclassified bydescrib- ingthetype ofmodulation and theusemade oftheresulting information.
Asaspecific example ofthese general remarks, letustake avery simple radar system which consists, asshown inFig.
5.1, ofanr-fpower source, anantenna, arectifier, ahigh-pass filter, anindicator, and a 127 128 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC.

tothe outgoing one, shifts continuously.
Inother words, the returned frequency isdifferent from the outgoing frequency, the difference being (2w/c)f with v,theradial velocity and cthevelocity oflight.
Numerically, with v,inmph and jdefined byawavelength xincm, the frequency” difference, which iscalled the ‘‘doppler frequency, ”is ;: Zz j: L_l-f.f-ilJ.—- /- FIG.

The doppler-shifted return signal, when added tothetransmitter voltage and rectified, gives rise toavoltage with small pulsations recurring atthe doppler fre- quency.
The steady component isremoved bythe highpass filter, which may besimply atransformer oraseries condenser.
The fluctuations areamplified and used toactuate the indicator.
Thus the presence ofa(mov- ing) target isdetected.
Although thesystem just described ishardly practical, apparatus working onexactly this principle but with slight te~hnical modifications can beuseful.
InFig.

The upper part ofthe diagram shows the amplitude ofthe Fourier components radiated bythe transmitter; the lower part shows the amplitude ofthe SEC.
52] TRANSMITTED SPECTRA 129 components present inthe receiver.
The modulation isproduced by target motion, and the system makes use ofthis modulation bydeter- mining the presence orabsence ofasignal ofdoppler-shifted frequency, and usually also, bygiving some indication ofthemagnitude and possibly thedoppler shift ofthis signal.
6.2.
Transmitted Spectra.
-Consider now aradar system ofageneral type, asdescribed from the Fourier-analysis point ofview, either bya diagram such asFig 52 or,more precisely, byaFourier series (or integral) forsome transmitter voltage orcurrent.
Such aseries might be written as E= z~new, (2) and weknow that ifCO.=nu, such aseries can represent any periodic’ function.
This series issufficiently general—in fact, that isthedifficulty.
The series contains more information about thetransmitted signal than is ~ commonly available.

5.3.—Approximate frequencysible forms ofmodulation might wellspectrum ofasequence ofpulses ofcarrier occupy abook, but sufficient infor- frequency f~,repetition irequency f,,and duration r.mation forpresent purposes iscon- tained inthebrief series ofstatements that follow.
Inthe amplitude-modulation case the signal generally consists ofa carrier ofangular frequency uO,which ismodulated atafrequency asso- ciated with the repetition rate.
Thus U.=coo+m.o, and wehave a carrier uoand anumber ofevenly spaced sidebands, asshown dia- grammatically inFig.
5.3, which shows aspectral distribution resulting from asequence ofpulses.
Ofcourse the signal isnot strictly periodio unless tiochances tobeanintegral multiple ofco,.
The sidebands have significant amplitude over arange that depends onthepulse width, being approximate y1/7onafrequency scale.
Thus the number ofimportant sidebands isroughly l/.f,~ orT,/r.Asis 1Thevoltages inradar systems areoften, andeven usually, notreally periodic— there isnophase relation between thevarious pulses.
Wechoose tosimplify the situation byignoring thisfact.
Ordinarily noharm isdone, forinf-manddoppler systems, voltages are periodic, andinnormal pulse systems therelative phases from pulse topulse areignored.
Inthespecial form ofpulse system known asthe“MTI type” (Chap, 16)thevoltages arenotactual] yperiodic, butspecial relations between receiver andtransmitter combine togive thesame effect. 130 C-WRADAR SYSTEMS [sm.53 pointed outinChap.

When frequency modulation isused, thevariation ofawith udepends ontheform ofmodulation just asitdepends, intheamplitude-modulation case, onthe pulse shape.
Usually the frequency isvaried either (a) sinusoidally or(b)inasawtooth manner.
The results areshown qualita- tively inFigs.
5.4aand 5.4b,which aredrawn forthenormal case inwhich the frequency deviation islarge compared tothemodulation frequency.

For pulse modulation, thephases aresuch astomake the component waves add toamaximum periodi- cally.
For example, ifone pulse is centered ontime t=O,the phases areallzero.
Inthefrequency-mod- ulation case, the phases are such that the various components add to give aresult that varies more orless sinusoidally with time, but with con- stant amplitude.
Ofcourse there aremany possible types ofmodulation besicfcs simple AM and FM but these will not be treated here.
5.3.
Effect ofTarget.—The effect ofreflection from the target onthis spectrum will now beconsidered.
First, allamplitudes aregreatly re- duced, asisdiscussed indetail in Chap.
2.
Second, the scattering cross section ofthe target is,in general, afunction ofo;thevarious amplitudes are therefore not equally reduced.
This effect can be expected tobenotable only when the target extent iscomparable toc divided bythe bandwidth.
Third, there isaphase change, linear inw, with proportionality constant depending onthe distance.
Fourth, all frequencies areshifted bythedoppler frequency.
Finally thescattering cross section varies with time; this introduces anadditional modulation which broadens each ofthereturned sidebands byanamount depending ontherate ofthe fluctuation.
(All this isforasingle target.
Usually there aremany targets, inwhich case the above specification isfurther complicated byasummation over alltargets.) SEC.
5.4] CLASS OF SYSTEMS CONSIDERED 131 Such, then, isthe information potentially available tothe receiver ofaradar set.
The amount ofthis information, which varies with set type, may beenormous, and use isseldom made ofallofit.
We may complete our classification ofpossible radar types byspecifying what use the receiver makes ofthis information.
For example, inaradar ofthe usual pulse type, the linear phase change ingoing from com- ponent tocomponent ofthe returned waves may bejust compensated byanincreased time.
Asaresult, thereturned waves add toamaximum atatime later than dothose intheoutgoing spectrum.
This time delay, which istheobserved quantity, may then beregarded asameasure ofthe rate ofchange ofphase with frequency ofthereturned components.
5.4.
Class ofSystems Considered.—In this chapter wewill consider that class ofsystems inwhich the modulation issuch that energy is emitted all, ornearly all,the time.
Quite arbitrarily, wetake “nearly all” tomean atleast 10percent ofthetime—a large percentage incom- parison with that usual.
inpulsed radar, where energy isgenerally emitted during less than 0.1per cent ofthe time.
InFourier terms this may mean, inthe case offrequency modulation, almost any bandwidth but phases such astogive constant amplitude.
Or,when amplitude modula- tion isemployed, itmeans that there are, atmost, 10significant side- bands.
There may exist only the carrier, asinthe simple system described inSec.
5.1, where themodulation isprovided bythetarget.
Inconsidering systems ofthis type, wewill first describe anumber of specific systems and foreach system the relevant theory, leaving any generalizations until the end ofthe chapter.
This appears tobethe only feasible course since ofmany possible systems few, ifany, will be familiar tothe average reader, and general theory would therefore be scarcely comprehensible.
The reader should bewarned that inthedescriptions ofthese specific systems quantitative information will belacking onvarious points, even onimportant ones.
For example, inthe fkst system discussed, theaural detection ofdoppler frequencies inthepresence ofhiss noise is employed.
Various questions immediately arise that aresimilar tothose treated inthelast part ofChap: 2.
Here they arenottreated—adequate information simply isnot available.
This situation and others like it arethe result ofthe fact that very little research has been done onc-w systems incomparison with that devoted topulse systems.
There arevarious reasons forthis comparative neglect ofc-wproblems, one of}vhich iscertainly valid.
Allthe c-w systems tobedescribed have only asmall effective receiver bandwidth (asexplained inChap.
4) and, therefore, alimited rate ofinformation transmission.
Obviously this istrue foramplitude-modulation systems with 10sidebands orless and with sideband spacing fixed (see Chap.
4)bythe maximum unam - 132 C-WRADAR S’YSTEMS [SEC.
56 biguous range, and itwill appear later tobetrue also offrequency- modulation systems.
5.6.
Utility ofC-w Systems.—In spite ofthe fact that c-w systems arelimited intheir rate ofinformation transmission they areofvalue fora number ofreasons.
First, there areinstances inwhich arapid rate of transmission isofnoadvantage.
Forexample, inthecase ofanaltimeter, there isone target, the earth.
Itsgeneral direction isknown and fresh information astoitsdistance ishardly needed more than afew times a second.
Observation 100 times asecond isactually employed inradar altimeters, tomake possible thereduction ofcertain errors byaveraging, but even sotherate ofinformation transmission issmall.
Second, there arethesituations inwhich, though alittle information may beobtained with ease, alotisimpossible toobtain.
Such asituation arises inthe presence ofvery severe clutter, where pulse systems, even with MTI equipment, may failtogive any information.
Certain doppler systems, onthe other hand, will provide useful and even adequate information.
Third, the price ofrapid transmission ofdata isacertain degree of apparatus complexity.
Insome cases, the gain isnot worth the price and thesimpler c-w system isadequate.
Finally, there are some things which pulse-type systems simply cannot dfiwork down tozero range, forexample.
Inthe descriptions ofc-w systems tofollow, they will bepresented roughly inthe order oftheir complexity astoobjects, conception, and apparatus.
Most ofthesystems described have seen some use, although afew that areincluded have been tried only briefly.
SPECIFIC SYSTEMS 5.6.
Simple Doppler System.—We describe first asystem capable of detecting one ormore moving objects inthepresence oflarge amounts of ground clutter.
Indetail, thespecification called forthedetection ofan airplane 50ftabove the ground at10miles range and aircraft athigher altitudes at15miles range.
Also, the system later proved most useful formeasuring velocities ofprojectiles.
Itwill beobserved that, inprinciple, the simple device shown in Fig.
5.1can doallthat isrequired.
Practically, however, two important modifications must bemade.
First, steps must betaken tokeep asmuch transmitter power as possible out ofthe rectifier.
There are two reasons forthis: (1)the only practical rectifiers atmicrowave frequencies are crystal detectors and these would burn outifconnected, asinFig.
5.1, toeven alow-power transmitter; (2)iftherectifier didsurvive, itwould respond toamplitude modulation ofthetransmitter and, since itcan befound from Eq.
(2.4u) SEC.
56] SIMPLE DOPPLER SYSTEM 133 that thereturned signal will be10–7 or10–’ times thetransmitted signal involtage, itfollows that amplitude modulation ofthe transmitter would have tobeheld below this value inorder not tobeobtrusive.
Though perhaps not impossible this would certainly bedifficult.
The easiest way tokeep transmitter power out ofthe receiver isto useseparate transmitting and receiving antennas, and this was thecourse adopted.
With amoderate amount ofwork ontheantennas, theleakage from transmitter toreceiver can bemade tobeofthe order l(FS orlees inpower.
Another power of10iscanceled byanadjustable leakage path from transmitter toreceiver.
Further than this itdoes not pay to gosince reflection from nearby ground objects contributes aleakage of this same order.
Ithas often been suggested that asingle antenna would besatis- factory ifabridge-like system were used similar tothat used intwo-way telephone repeaters.
Ordinarily however the single antenna isnot satisfactory., For one thing, the increased antenna gain resulting from greater available dish area islost because ofthe power used bythe ‘‘artificial” antenna which balances thereal one.
More important, since very slight mechanical changes will spoil a60-db balance between two equal voltages, such bridge systems tend tobehighly microphonics.
The second modification relates totheintermediate frequency ofthe crystal mixer.
The reader will have observed that the system iswell described asasuperheterodyne with zero intermediate frequency, the leakage from thetransmitter constituting the local oscillator power and the modulation frequency being the doppler frequency.
The only unconventional feature isthat thesignal issingle sideband.
IOfcourse, the absolute sensitivity ylimit ofsuch asystem depends onkTand the bandwidth ofthe amplifier.
Experimentally, however, this limit isnot even remotely approached because acrystal detector, when passing current, generates anoise analogous tocarbon microphone hiss.
This noise increases with decreasing frequency and isenormous compared tothermal noise foraudio frequencies.
Toavoid this excess noise a local oscillator isintroduced and amplification done atsome normal intermediate frequency, 30Me/see forexample.
Atthis frequency the excess noise isnegligible.
Inthe i-famplifier astrong component is found due tothe beat between leakage from the transmitter and power from the local oscillator, and amuch weaker component, due tothe target, displaced bythedoppler frequency.
After suitable amplification these two frequencies are passed into asecond detector whose output signal consists ofad-c component associated with leakage from the 1Itisnotdifficult tomake systems that determine onwhich sideofthecarrier the sideband lies, andarethus able todiscriminate between approaching andreceding targets. 134 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC.
56 transmitter, and thedoppler frequency.
The d-ccomponent isremoved bypassage through atransformer, orotherwise, and thedoppler frequency isused toactuate theindicator.
Anincidental but important advantage ofthis modification isthat itenables the useofasuitable and easily adjustable crystal current.
These modifications areintroduced inamanner indicated inFig.
5.5 which shows ablock diagram ofthe system.
Everything isstraight- forward, except for the local-oscillator power which isobtained by modulating the transmitter and selecting asuitable sideband bymeans ofabandpass filter.
This insures aconstant intermediate frequency and avoids any tuning problems.
Frequency-doubling isemployed inthe modulator toavoid difficulties inkeeping leakage from the crystal oscillator out ofthe i-famplifier.

Design Procedure.
—Having blocked out aproposed system, wemay now sketch the design procedure that fixed the various apparatus con- stants and dimensions.
Design commenced with the choice ofanindicator.
Avoltmeter will certainly work, but experience has shown that aspeaker orpair of earphones, inconjunction with the operator’s hearing sense, ismuch more effective provided the frequencies tobedetected lieinthe range between afew hundred and afew thousand cycles persecond.
1Within this range, the ear easily recognizes pure tones inthe presence ofhiss even when thepure note ismuch tooweak tobeseen onanoscillograph.
This phenomenon isanalogous tothe averaging performed bythe eye when looking atanA-scope, asdiscussed inChap.
2.
Rough experi- ments show that the earwill detect apure tone inthe presence ofhiss when the tone isstronger than the noise ina200-cps bandwidth.
If the ear can dothis over the range 200 to3000 cps, then byusing the IAdetailed study oftheaural detection problem canbefound inRRL Report No.411-86, May 5,1944, SEC.
5.6] SIMPLE DOPPLER SYSTEM 135 simplest possible indication method, apower gain ofroughly 15to1over what might behad byusing voltmeter oroscillograph can beachieved.
Aural indication istherefore thelogical choice.
This decision, together with the maximum target speed, almost determines the wavelength, forthe doppler frequency must bechosen tolieinarange forwhich the earissensitive.
Thus A=10cmgives, byEq.
(l), 8.9cps/mph orabout 3000 cycles for300 mph.
Atthetime this system was designed, faster planes were not common.
Even so, asomewhat longer wavelength might have been desirable, but 10cmwas chosen because good tubes were available atthis wavelength.
This wavelength proved satisfactory, but itsometimes gives doppler frequencies rather below thefrequency region inwhich theearissensitive.
Toovercome this difficulty, provision was made tomodulate the audio signal with a500-cps tone.
The modulator was abalanced one, sothat the500-cPs carrier outp-s zero when thesignal was zero.
The result- ingvariations inamplitude ofthetone were quite distinctive, even mthe presence ofthe noise modulation, and carried the effectiveness ofthe system down tofrequencies aslow asdesired.
The wavelength being determined, the antenna size was chosen.
Togetasmuch range aspossible, this was taken aslarge aswas feasible without either (a)making the device impractically large or(b)getting the beam sosharp that atthe specified angular rate ofscan the beam would beonthetarget tooshort atime forthelistener tohear it.
Both requirements ledtoadiameter inthe neighborhood of40in., the value finally chosen.
Itnow remained only toestimate the power required.
This could bedone either onthe basis ofexperience with similar systems orby calculations ofthesort outlined inChap.
2.
Asaresult ofsuch considera- tions, apower of10to15watts was chosen.
This completes the discussion ofthe basic design ofthe system.
A few ofthe apparatus details will begiven later but first various points will bediscussed which arenot mentioned inChap.
2but which areof importance incomputing the range.
These allrelate tothe effective bandwidth, the geometrical factors that determine the transmission attenuation being the same forpulse and c-w systems.
E~ectioe Bandwidth .—IVhat then, inprinciple, determines the mini- mum bandwidth ofadoppler system? Ifweuse asimple indicator, such asavoltmeter, the bandwidth must besufficient toinclude the doppler frequencies ofalltargets of interest.
This bandwidth isthen determined simply bythe wavelength and therange oftarget velocities.
If,however, weconsider only targets ofone radial velocity, oruse some more complex indicator that divides the possible doppler range 136 C-WRADAR SYSTEMS [SEC.
5.6 into small bands and looks ateach band separately, there are certain limits that determine how small theband may be—limits other than the obvious one ofthe response time ofthe indicator.
Three such limits arediscussed inthefollowing paragraphs.
The first isdue tothe modulation arising from scanning.
Ifthe system isscanned, thebeam will beonthetarget foronly afinite time, with theresult that even asingle-frequency doppler signal will bespread over aband whose extent will beroughly the reciprocal ofthe time during which the beam isonthe target.
This isobvious enough, and would not beworth further discussion, were itnot forthe fact that the same consideration arises inconnection with the system’s ability to reject clutter.
The presence ofscattering objects onthe ground gives rise, aswehave seen, toad-c component inthe output signal ofthe second detector.
This direct-current component will beafunction of azimuth angle and so,asthesystem scans, wefind atthesecond detector output that is,direct current plus various “varying direct current’ ‘— low-frequency components extending up toamaximum frequency roughly given bythe reciprocal ofthe time the beam isonthe target.
But theground returns aresoenormous compared totarget signals that one might fear that even the tails ofthe ground-return frequency spec- trum would belarge compared with the desired signals.
Actually, this fear isnot realized, aswill beshown byabrief calculation.
The general Idea onwhich this calculation isbased isasfollows: Ifthe system scans atauniform rate, the system output signal asa function oftime asitscans across afixed target depends onthedirectivity asafunction ofangle.
The frequency spectrum isthen the Fourier transform ofthe directivity function.
But this directivity depends ontheillumination ofthedish and isinfact theFourier transform ofthe illumination asafunction ofdistance across the dish.
But the Fourier transform ofaFourier transform isthefunction itself, and sowefind the interesting theorem that thefrequency spectrum due toscanning hasthe same form asthe function representing the illumination ofthe dish.
Actually, the above statement represents aslight oversimplification because wehave assumed that the antenna directivity enters only once whereas actuallyitenters twice, once inthe sending process and once inthe receiving.
Taking this into account and carrying out the cal- culation, wefind that the spectrum due toscanning, which weshall call g(u), isgiven by .

Although this calculation ismore complicated for separate transmitter and receiver dishes, etc., the important general conclusion stands—namely that, insofar asthe approximations used are good, the spectrum produced byscanning is definitely confined toafinite frequency range.
Another lower limit onbandwidth issetbythe modulation due to fluctuation intarget cross sections.
Ifthe target isanairplane, for example, inspection ofFig.
3.8shows that even moderate yawing will introduce large fluctuations inreturned signal.
The frequency spread sointroduced depends ontherate ofyaw and onthe ratio ofthetarget dimensions tothe wavelength, this ratio determining the number of pattern lobes per radian.
Calculations are difficult because oflack of data, but experimentally avalue ofabout 30cpsatx=10cmisfound.
Another and equivalent point ofview isthat when the plane isturning different parts have different doppler frequencies.
Finally there is,inprinciple, alimit set bytarget acceleration.
Thus ifwehave anaccelerating target itmay happen that the doppler frequency will transit the pass range ofthe band-determining filter before the filter has time tobuild up, inwhich case the signal may be missed.

Apparatus Considerations.
—Having blocked out the system and determined the leading design constants, wecan now proceed with the detailed engineering.
Figures 5.6and 5.7show the final result; there follow afewremarks astothemore important ways inwhich theengineer- ingtechnique forthis system cliffersfrom that used inpulse systems.
There are nohigh pulse powers and both intermediate- and audio- frequency amplifiers arenarrow-band.
Gains per stage are limited by stability rather than bybandwidth; inother words, the technique is like that ofordinary radio rather than like that oftelevision.
Because ofthe large size ofthe leakage signal relative tothe target signal, only 138 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC, 5.6 relatively small i-famplifications canbeused, theremaining amplification being done after thesecond detector.

Range-measuring Doppler System.—In order tomeasure the range ofone ormore targets, the outgoing wave must bemarked, or modulated, insome way and the time required forthe marks onthe wave train toreturn must bemeasured.
The modulation may beof either the amplitude orthe frequency type, the techniques forthe two methods being quite different.

This modulation gives rise toalarge number ofsidebands, and the distance ofthe target may beregarded asdetermining therelative phase shifts ofthevarious sidebands ontheir return path.
The fundamental point here isthedetermination oftherelative phase shifts, not the multiplicity ofsidebands.
Actually only two frequencies are needed, aswewill now show byconsidering the simplest possible amplitude-modulated c-w system capable ofmeasuring range.
The system consists, inprinciple, oftwo separate systems like that just described, the two systems having transmitter frequencies differing byanamount f,.
The transmitted and received spectra then appear asinFig.
5.8with the two receivers receiving ~0and .fO+~,byleakage 140 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC37 and jOf~D,jO+j,f$Dr,from the target, with ~Dand ~D~very slightly different because ofthe difference intransmitter frequencies.
This slight difference indoppler frequencies leads toaphase difference between the two doppler-frequency outputs which isalinear function oftime, just asthe target range isalinear function oftime forconstant radial velocity.
This suggests that the phase difference isameasure ofthe range.
This isinfact thecase, asmay beshown analytically, orqualitatively bythe following argument.
Ifthe target isvery close tothe system, FIG, 5.8.—The upper figure shows thefrequencies present inthetrans- mitter spectrum.
Thelower gives the same information for the receiver.
Frequencies foandfo+/,inthereceiver areduetoleakage from thetransmitter; thesame frequencies ffDcomefrom the target.thenumber ofwavelengths from trans- mitter totarget and back will bethe same, even though thetwo transmitter wavelengths differ slightly.
Thus the leakage and target signals will bein phase orout ofphase atthe two re- ceivers simultaneously and thedoppler outputs will beinphase forthis range.
Asthe target gets further away, this phase difference increases, finally be- coming 27rwhen thenumber ofwave- lengths tothe target and back isone greater forj,+j,than forfo.
Ana- lytically one easily finds that the range isgiven by (5) with @thephase shift between thetwo doppler frequencies.
This isaperfectly feasible system and has worked inthe field.
Itis not nearly socomplicated asappears from thedescription since the two transmitters can becombined, asalso can most parts ofthe receivers.
The apparatus isessentially like that ofthesystem described inSec.
5.6 with the addition ofamodulator for the transmitter, another audio channel, and aphase meter.
No detailed description will begiven because, asyet, nogreat practical application ofthe method has been made.
The principal difficulty atpresent isthelack ofawell-developed phase meter that will work over arange ofboth frequent yand amplitude.
Nevertheless, some further discussion isinorder both because ofthe principles involved and because some future use may bemade ofthe idea.
Four points ofprinciple should benoted.
First, tomeasure the SEL57] ttANGE-JfEAS[’RING DOPPLER SYSTE.%f 141 distance toasingle target, only one additional sideband isneeded.
,Second, thepresence ofthedoppler shift, applying asitdoes toboth side- bands, does not interfere Nihhdistance measurement.
Third, the two receivers are separate and their bandwidths are determined bythe doppler frequency, not bythe modulation orrepetition frequency.
Fourth, wenow have two design frequencies, f~and j,,and itisamatter ofgreat importance which isthe greater.
If.f~<<~,, asthe diagram above implies, the apparatus works asdescribed.
If-f,<f~,,the opera- tion isthe same inprinciple but signals will bewithin the doppler taken this beat will completely dominate thetarget signals.
Since the sense ofthis ine- quality isanimportant factor in allthe systems tobedescribed from here on, this section closes with afew further remarks con- cerning it.

Inspection ofthe last two figures will show that, forradar systems ingeneral, there isno“usual” case.
One may perfectly well have either sign ofthe inequality.
For example with A=3.3 cm and velocities greater than 100mph, ~Disgreater than 2950 cpsand amaximum range of93miles would give f,S1000 cps.
Ontheother hand alower velocity and shorter range might, inconjunction with alonger wavelength, lead to numbers like w=10mph, X=10cm, r=9.3miles, values which would give .fD=89.4cps,jr<10,OOOcps. 142 C-II’RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC.

The filters are designed toremove j,completely, ~vhile leaving allbut closely adjacent frequencies undisturbed.
Inprinciple, this isnodifferent from the infinite-at tenuat ionfilters already present toremove the d-csignals due toclutter.
Practically, somewhat more trouble isinvolved, since zero frequency filters are stable because neither the frequency nor the filter tuning can change, while both possibilities are present forfrequencies other than zero.
Usually also, either byaccident ordesign, various harmonics ofj,will bepresent and these also must befiltered out.

F-m Range-measuring System.—The next system to be described isonethat illustrates thef-m technique ofrange measurement.
The specific problem isthat ofaradio altimeter.
Inthis case, wewish tomeasure the distance toasingle target, noclutter ispresent, and the target radial velocity may bezero.
.Mso, the system must work down tozero range.
The system described below was very successful and TransmlthngRecelwngantenna “-J-”* FIG.5.11.—Simplified hiock diagram off-m system for measuring range, itand the proximity fuze arethe two c-w systems that have been most \riclely used.

Plainly enough, the greater the target distance, thegreater this beat frequency; itsmagnitude isthen adirect measure ofthe range.
The signal ofthis frequency istherefore amplified and limited, and thefrequency measured, usually byacycle-counting device ofsome sort.
The frequency meter isthen calibrated interms ofrange..2 Such asystem would work, asdescribed, and would also work on multiple targets.
But linear frequency modulation isnot easy, and forsingle targets the operation isnot greatly affected byachange from linear tosinusoidal frequency modulation.
The difference frequency then varies sinusoidally with time, but the important point remains, namely that themean magnitude ofthe difference frequency de- pends onthe range.
Sinusoidal e frequency modulation istherefore ~radopted since itrequires simpler 2 apparatus and accomplishes the ~ same result.
There isone subtlety that is worth some discussion.

ThehorL- sponding tothe modulating fre- zontal axisintheupper figure corresponds to quency.
This would mean thatthemean transmitter frequency f~.
each modulation period would contain the sa’me number ofcycles.
This number isthen integral and weseethat the frequency meter can read only 1,2,..“,ntimes the modulating frequency.
Actually, thesame conclusion holds even with nospecial relation between modula- tion and carrier frequencies, if,asisusual, weuseacycle-counting type offrequency meter.
Naturally, itisofinterest totranslate this step- wise behavior ofthe frequency meter into altitude readings.
For the linear-modulation case weeasily find j~=4j,Ajh/c with f,the modu- lating frequency, Afthe total frequency swing, f.thebeatfrequency, and hthe height.

5.8] F-M RANGE-MEASURING SYSTEM 145 (7) ‘I’his isofthe nature ofamaximum error and can bemuch reduced byaveraging over anumber ofmodulation cycles.
Design Procedure.
—Design ofsuch analtimeter isbegun byusing theabove equation, together with anallowable altitude error, topick a suitable Af.
Inthe present case Ajwas chosen as40Xfc/see, which corresponds toah=6ft,and so,because ofaveraging, toarather smaller operational error.
The mean transmitter frequency isnow chosen.
This must be fairly high inorder tokeep.
thefrequency variation from being animpos- sibly large fraction ofthemean trequency.
Ontheother hand there isno gain invery high frequencies and there may besome loss inintensity over such terrain asforests.
These considerations, plus aconsideration ofthe tubes available, ledtothe choice ofamean frequency of440 Me/see, which can beobtained from acorn tubes; thefrequency modu- lation isaccomplished mechanically.
The modulation frequency isnext chosen togive aconvenient range ofbeat frequenciesf~, subject totherestriction that thetime ofamodulat- ing cycle shall belong compared tothe maximum signal transit time.
Avalue of120cpswas picked.
This gives ~a=8000 cpsatanaltitude of 400 ft.
Asecond range ofOto4000 ftisobtained byreducing Ajto 4Me/see.
This completes themajor specifications, except forthepower.
Prac- tically speaking, power must bedecided onthe basis ofexperience, calculations ofavailable power and thermal noise power being quite useless since, inpractice, the limitation isnot thermal noise but micro- phonics, etc.
Thus ifweconsider the earth asadiffuse reflector }\-e easily find thereceived power is(1/2m) (A/r2) times theearth’s reflection coefficient and times the transmitted power.
Even for very small transmitter powers and reflection coefficients, this power islarge compared tothermal noise.
Onthe basis ofexperience, then, itwas decided that the0.3watt available from anacorn tube would besufficient foraltitudes upto5000 ft,provided certain points ofapparatus detail were correct, asexplained below.
Apparatus Considerations.
—The leading parameters having been specified, one can proceed with the detailed design.
This isstraight- forward, except forcertain steps necessary toreduce various spurious signals inthereceiver which might limit therange.
These signals, forthemost part, aredue toamplitude modulation in the transmitter.
This amplitude modulation comes from microphonics and fwm slight variation oftransmitter amplitude with fTE!qU(311Cy. 146 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC.
58 Modulation from the latter source isatthe modulating frequency and low harmonics thereof.
These spurious signals may begreatly reduced bytwo devices.
First, one makes themixer ofFig.
5.11 abalanced one — ---ml FIG.
5.13.—The AN/APN-l frequency-modulated radar altimeter, (Reprinted from Electronic-s.) (see Vol.
24) with the result that, ifthe balance isgood, amplitude modulation from the transmitter balances out inthe detector output.
Second, theamplifier that precedes thelimiter isgiven aresponse that is arising function offrequency.
The spurious signals, being largely of SEC, 59] ML’LTIPLE-TARGET F-M RANGE JIEALSCRE.llEIVT 147 frequency Iowerthan thedesired signals, arethus discriminated against.
Roughly speaking, theresponse should riselinearly with frequency, since, onavoltage basis, the incoming signals godown atabout this rate in range and thus inthe equivalent frequency.
This frequency distortion serves asecond purpose inthat itmakes theoutput signal less dependent onaltitude sothat the limiter does not ha~-e to\vork over such alarge range ofamplitude.
The complete dc~ice isillustrated inFig, 5.13.
The effect ofdoppler shift istoraise orlower the dotted curve (Fig.
5.12) corresponding tothe returned signal.
With the proportions here used and with theaircraft inreasonably level flight, thedoppler frequency isalmost always less than the beat frequency due toaltitude; con- sequently the end result isthat there aresomewhat fewer cycles ofbeat frequency inone half ofthe modulating cycle, and somewhat more in theother, thetotal number percycle remaining thesame.
The difference innumbers ofcycles inthetwo halves ofthe modulation period isthen ameasure ofthe doppler frequency.
This difference can bemeasured invarious ways, and has been used, along with thealtitude information, invarious dcvelop:nents ofthedevice here described.
5.9.
Multiple-Target F-m Range Measurement.—In the absence of clutter and doppler shift almost the same methods can beused with a plurality oftargets aswith asingle target.
Inthis case linear frequency variation with time isalmost essential, and the triangular form ofFig.
5.12 isprobably most convenient, though asaw-tooth variation might beused.
The detector output then contains anumber offrequencies, one corresponding toeach target range present.
Preferably these fre- quencies are detected bysome device such asaFrahm vibrating-reed frequency meter, which indicates allfrequencies simultaneously.
If, however, time isnoobject, adevice that scans the frequency range may beused.
Avariable frequency can beadded tothesignal frequency and observations made when the sum frequency falls inthe pass band ofa resonant circuit.
l“ariants ofthis idea sweep either j,orAjand observe when thetarget frequency falls inthepass band ofaresonant circuit.
Any ofthese scanning devices greatly increases the time required to obtain the desired information.
Thus ifwehave afrequency band f which istobesplit into npieces, thetime required forsuch adevice asa Frahm meter torespond isofthe order n/f, whereas ifthe nfrequency intervals areobserved insequence thetime isn2/f.
The general design procedure isessentially thesame asthat described inSec.
5.8.
First wedecide ontheallowable range error &and determine from this thetotal frequency swing Ajbymeans ofEq, (7): 148 C-T RADAR SYSTE.lf S [SEC.
59 We may note that l/-lA~ isanalogous tothe pulse time; itdetermines thewidth ofw-aveband transmitted and therange accuracy.
Next, one determines the modulation orrepetition frequency j,.
Asinpulse systems, this depends onthemaximum range.
But whereas inpulse systems j,may actually beasmuch asc/2r, inthepresent systems one must have f,markedly less than c/2r inorder that not too large a fraction ofthetime will bewasted while thesign ofthebeat frequency is changing.
Subject tothis upper limit, the choice off, isdetermined by considerations ofbandwidth, response time, and apparatus convenience.
The smaller j,,the narrower the band and the slower the response.
Also, the beat frequency, which varies with ~,,should bekept inarange suitable forthefrequency meter tobeused.
The maximum beat frequency isthen determined as4~.A~(r/c), and anindicator working uptothis frequency bysteps ofj,isdesigned.
The number ofsteps isthus about r~~r.
This method ofranging, like the pulse method, makes nospecial requirements onthecarrier frequency, which isthen chosen onthebasis of other considerations.
The power requirecl depends ontheusual things, including thebancl- width, which inthis case isthe bandwidth ofone element ofthe fre- quency meter—frhich should beabout j..
This scheme, although ithasnotbeen highly developed, Trill undoubt- edly work much asdescribe(l.
High range accuracy and small band- widths are possible-in fact one may ha~-e both aton~-e.
Thus one might ha~-e arepetition rate, ancl soanoise bandwidth, of,forexample, 10cps while lm~-ing afrequency swing of4031c sec., which \\-ould gi~’e range accuracy corresponding roughly toa*-psec pulse.
And this latter would beachie~-ed without awidebaml i-for~-ideo.
If,however, ~~eattempt tomodify the system soastoallow the presence ofclutter, and therefore also adopplei- shift ofthesignal coming from thetarget, two difficulties arise.

This shows, in thefull curve; asinusoidal depend- ence ofthe transmitted frequency on time.
The total frequency swing ismade large compared to the doppler frequency.
The re- ceived frequency, indicated bythe dotted line, isasimilar curve but (a)displaced tothe right bytime delay resulting from transmission tothetarget and back and (b)dis- placed vertically bydoppler shift.
Ifnow the difference between the transmitted and received frequen- cies ispassed through alow-pass filter whose pass band includes fre- quencies ashigh asthe maximum doppler frequency, there will, in general, belittle signal output be- cause the difference frequency will begreater than the doppler fre- quency over the majority oftheI FIG.5.14.—The fullcurve intheupper graph shows theinstantaneous transmitter frequency asafunction oftime; thedotted curve shows thereceived signal; andthe dashed curve, thebeat between thetwo.

modulation cycle.
If,however, the modulation frequency isadjusted sothat one cycle corresponds tothetransmission delay time, the differ- ence frequency will always just equal the doppler frequent yand soa large output signal will result.
Thus, asthe modulation frequency is varied, output occurs whenever n/f,=2r/c with nany integer and r the distance toatarget.
Ground clutter, having nodoppler shift, gives anoutput that isperiodic with period corresponding tothemodula- tion frequency.
The d-c component iseasily removed and, iffD<jr, the other components areremoved bythe low-pass filter, which passes only uptof..
If,therefore, f.<j,ground clutter may, inprinciple, beremoved.
Avariant ofthis scheme turns thereceiver offduring one modulation 150 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC.

This permits the use ofasingle antenna and also reduces theclutter intensity bymaking itpossible togate outthe strong returns from near-by objects.

Practically, there are limits onthe last two factors, the limits being setbyquestions ofapparatus complexity.

If,asweshall assume forpurposes ofexplanation, only asingle target istobeobserved, the transmitter isturned onfor half the keying cycle and offduring the other half bymeans ofthe modulator, square-wave generator, TR and ATR tubes.
Ifamul- tiplicity oftargets must behandled, the transmitter pulse ismade correspondingly shorter.
The transmitter power then follows the Curve aofFig.
5“16,and thereceiver input follows Curve bwith thetime delay depending onthe range and with the dotted part ofthe received signal rejected because the receiver isoff.1This received signal isamplified byaconventional superheterodyne receiver whose only special feature isthe derivation ofthe local-oscillator frequencY from the transmitter frequency bythe addition of30Me/see.

Thus the clutter, the doppler frequency, and much noise have been removed, while theposition ofthetrai~ing edge ofthe pulse, which isameasure of therange, isundisturbed.
The time delay ofthe trailing edge ofthe wave atd,relative tothe modulating pulse, isnow ameasure oftarget range.
This time, orrange, may bedisplayed onthelinear radial sweep ofaPPI tube bydifferentiat- ingthe voltage and using the result tointensity-modulate the beam.
Afew minor points remain tobe considered.
First, the explanation has assumed that the bandwidth is large enough topass square waves without distortion.
Actually, the operation issubstantially the same when only afew harmonics ofj,are passed.
Second, thefunction ofthe attenuated square-wave voltage in- troduced after Point 1istobalance‘+ru- nnI-1 FIG.5.17.—Curve ashows thevoltage atPoint 1(cf.Fig.5,15) duetoastationary target andbshows thatduetoamoving target; thedotted envelope curve corre- sponds tothedoppler frequency.

Finally, itshould benoted that the last filter can have fairly narrow pass bands, thereby considerably reducing thenoise. SEC.5.11] PULSE-MODULATED DOPPLER SYSTEM 153 DesignProcedure.—The leading requirement inthedesign ofasystem such asthat described above was arange of75miles onsingle targets movingat speeds upto400 mph, even inthepresence ofextreme ground clutter.
First, since ability todeal with multiple targets was not required, the modulation cycle was taken tobehalf onand half off.
Next, the repetition frequency was chosen tobeashigh aspossible, consistent with getting areasonable fraction oftheextreme range signals toreturn during the time the receiver ison.
Thus the value ofj,=1000 CPS, which was selected, lets the entire return signal into the receiver at r=46.5 miles and none at93miles, sothat at75miles about half is lost.
The advantage ofahigh value off, isthereduction innumber of stop bands required inthefilter.
The dish size and wavelength were chosen—on the basis ofrange, propagation factors, and beamwidth-to be12ftand 40cm, respectively.
This latter value also determines the doppler band, which extends from zero toabout 1000 cps for400-mph targets.
Thus weneed carry only one harmonic oftherepetition frequency.
The transmitter power depends ongeometrical factors inthe usual way, and ontheeffective bandwidth ofthereceiver.
Itmight bethought that this would bethetotal width ofthe pass bands inthe second filter ofFig.
5.15, but actually, because oftherectifier between thetwo filters, thenoise depends onthebandwidths, both before and after this detector.
Infact, theeffective bandwidth isthegeometric mean ofthetwo band- widths.
The last bandwidth was chosen atabout 4cps, this being the smallest consistent with thetime during which thebeam remains onthe target; and the first bandwidth was about twice the maximum doppler frequency.
Thus the effective bandwidth, fornoise-computation pur- poses, was about 100cps.
With this bandwidth, atransmitter power of 100watts should give therequired range.
Apparatus Considerations.
—The leading design parameters having been chosen, the next subject ofdiscussion isthe technical difficulties involved.
There aretwo chief ones, both having todowith elimination ofground clutter: (1)frequency, and also amplitude, modulation inthe transmitter must beheld tovery low values; and (2)the filters, which reject frequencies O,j,,2~,,etc., present aconsiderable problem.
Astothefirst point, theentire operation ofthe system ispredicated ontheassumption that theground returns areperiodic.
This assumption would becompletely falsified, iftherange ofaground target, measured in wavelengths, were tochange byaslittle asx/2 inone repetition cycle.
Since, inround numbers, there are10’wavelengths contained intwice the maximum range, itisapparent that theoperation will not even approxi- mate the above description unless the short-time frequency stability 154 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC.
5.11 exceeds one partin 10’.
Actually, much better than this must bedone since the ground returns may be90dborthereabouts above the target returns.
Thus, one might expect stabilities ofthe order of10’0 tobe needed.
Much calculation can bedone onthis point but, though such calculation was useful inshowing that aworkable system was possible, itwill suffice tosay here that byvery careful attention todetail itwas found possible completely toeliminate alltrouble due tofrequency (and amplitude) modulation ofthetransmitter.
The main points were: crystal control ofboth transmitter and modulator, very careful regulation and filtering ofpower supplies, and operation ofimportant filament supplies with alternating current (3000 cps) obtained bymultiplication from therepetition frequency.
Wenext consider the“infinite rejection” filters that aretoremove the ground clutter.
The maximum attenuation required isthe quantity ofmost impor- tance.
Naturally, this isindefinite since itdepends onthe terrain, and pertinent measurements are very scanty.
But the attenuation needed may beestimated inseveral ways, which agree moderately well, and finally itwas measured onthe finished system.
Data from allsources indicate that ground returns inmountainous terrain may bemuch larger than istommy-dy realized—in the present case, ofthe order of90db above noise.
The first method ofestimation istocalculate the largest possible ground return onthe assumption that the return isfrom amountain so large astofillthe beam completely.
Such amountain iscertainly possible, and assuming ittobehemispherical itsreturns will belarger than those from atarget ofcross section ainthe ratio r2A/k’u with A the dish area.
Inthe present case, this comes out atabout 110 db.
This iscertainly anoverestimate because the mountain will generally not have unity reflection coefficient, and because the part ofthe model that does the reflecting-namely, the part ofthe hemisphere normal to the line ofsight—will usually bemissing inactuality.
Nevertheless, thecalculation isinteresting asindicating that oery large ground returns arepossible.
Asecond estimate can bederived from measurements made atEllen- ville, N.Y.with amore orless normal (l-psec, 100-kw) pulse system.
These measurements showed aground return 75dbabove noise.
To compare these measurements with our present problem, anumber of factors must betaken into account.
These are: thedifference inpulse lengths (N27db), thedifferent receiver bandwidths (*30db), and the different transmitter powers (*30 db).
Taking these factors into account, the clutter returns atPoint 1,Fig.
5.15, may bevery crudely SEC, 5.11] PULSE-MODULATED DOPPLER SYSTE.\f 155 estimated as100dbabove thenoise ina103-cycle band, or130dbabove that inal-cycle band.
Athird estimate can bemade from measurements onthe completed system atthis same location, which showed aclutter 100 dbabove the noise inal-cycle band.
Part ofthe discrepancy between this and the above 130-db estimate isnodoubt due tocrudities inthe estimation, therest tothefact that theclutter ina500-~sec pulse will certainly beless than 500 times that inal-~sec pulse because the clutter isnot spread uniformly inrange.
Inany case, whatever the reason, the clutter is experimentally found tobeabout 70dbabove the noise inthe 1000- cycle audio band, orabout 80dbabove thenoise intheeffective band of 100cycles.
The system, asactually made and tested atthis same location, had 92-db attenuation atthe “infinite attenuation” points ofthe filters and experience showed that this was just comfortably adequate.
From theabove results weconclude that the filters must have about 90dbofrejection for satisfactory operation atthis particular site.
Measurements atother sites would bevaluable inanswering thequestion astohow representative this site is.
Lacking such data, wecan only venture the opinion, based onpersonal observation, that the location didnotappear unusual inany way-in fact itappears likely that moun- tain areas with even higher ground returns may becommon.
The width ofthe rejection bands depends onthe variability ofthe ground returns.
Until now, the ground returns have been assumed constant, sothat the voltage atPoint 1inFig.
5.15 isactually periodic and could therefore beremoved byfilters with infinitesimal bandwidth.
Actually theground returns vary, with theresult that thefilter rejection bands must have afinite width.
Using some data ofH.Goldstein, 1a width of4cycles 12dbupfrom the 92-db bottom ofthe’ curve was chosen.
Even ifthe ground returns had been constant, much the same bandwidth would have been needed because ofmodulation due to scanning.
The rest ofthe curve was then made asnarrow aspossible.
This turned outtobeabout 200cycles atthe3-db point.
Additional filters foreliminating “window” signals orrain clutter were also provided and could beswitched inwhen desired.
These filters had much less attenuation than the clutter filters, but the at- tenuation extended over awider frequency range, designed toexclude doppler frequencies due tomotion of“window.” Although theaudio amplifier began tocutoffrapidly above 1000 cps, and the strength ofthe harmonics ofj,decreased fairly rapidly, itwas found necessary tohave infinite attenuation filters at2000 and 3000 cps, 1See Sec.
6.20, Vol.
13ofthisseries. 156 C-W RADAR SYSTEMS [SEC.
5.11 inaddition tothose atOand 1000 cps.
Naturally, these latter filters were notnearly socritical astheoneat1000 cps.
This concludes thediscussion ofthedesign and theleading difficulties ofasystem ofthis type.
Performance was much asexpected.
Inparticular, thestrong ground clutter mentioned above was completely eliminated, targets being tracked regardless ofrange orposition.
Allother known systems that have been developed tothe field-trial stage were tried atthis same site; none ofthem eliminated theground clutter.
The only deficiency ofthis system, ashas been pointed out, isits inability tofunction properly when there areanumber oftargets inthe beam.
When this isthecase, therange indicated isthat ofthestrongest target.
Thk difficulty may bereduced asdesired byreducing thelength ofthe transmitted puJse, bycorrespondingly increasing the number of filter bands, and soincreasing the complexity.
Since the general objects ofthis system aremuch the same asthose ofthe MTI system described inChap.
16,some comparison isinorder, even though this comparison isdifficult and possibly dependent on personal viewpoint.
First, thetwo systems regarded from anabstract point ofview work onsimilar principles.
Both have, therefore, much thesame fundamental limitations.
Practically, however, thetwo systems useentirely different apparatus, and consequently when, asisusually the case, apparatus limitations dominate, thesystems may beexpected tobeentirely differ- ent.
Furthermore, because ofthis apparatus difference, one may expect future developments toimprove thetwo indifferent ways and bydifferent amounts.
Second, thetwo systems differ intheir ability tohandle amultiplicity oftargets.
Asactually constructed, MTI syst~ms use 1-or2-~sec pulses and soarecapable ofhandling targets athousand feet orsoapart inrange.
Ontheother hand, thesystem described inthis section works ononly one target, and although amoderate number ofadditional filters might beconsidered aspossible whenever anyone wishes todeal with multiple targets there iscertainly apractical limit totheir number.
Possibly dividing the total range into 10pieces would bereasonable.
For traffic control around abusy airport, however, thec-w system would bealmost useless whereas the MTI system would bevery good.
For long-range detection ofaircraft, anability tohandle 10targets might well suffice and the c-w system therefore beadequate.
When, onthe other hand, one considers severe ground clutter the system described above hastheadvantage over theMTI systems.
MTI systems atpresent reduce theclutter byperhaps 30db-which inmany locations isadequate.
But mountainous terrain that does not appear SEC.

Summary.
-In aneffort tohelp the reader who wishes tocom- pare the various systems described inthis chapter, Table 5.1has been prepared giving, intabular form, asummary ofthe more important systems ofcharacteristics, both qualitative and quantitative.
This table isworthy ofcareful study but two limitations must beremembered.
First, the quantities given fornumbers ofsidebands, noise band, etc., areonly qualitatively correct; really precise definitions would require so many qualifications astorender thequantities either useless orconfusing.
Second, neither the table nor this chapter pretends todescribe allc-w systems; atleast adozen more areknown and nodoubt still more could be invented.
Itisbelieved, however, that representatives ofallimportant types have been included.
From this table, orwhat has gone before, the reader will perceive that there have been grouped together, inthis chapter, some rather diverse systems.
Perhaps abetter, iflonger, chapter title would have been “Systems That Are Not Pulse Systems.
” Ifweattempt aclassification, the two best starting points appear to bethe questions—does itutilize the doppler shift ornot, and does it use delay-time demodulation off-m signals for range determination? Further questions are—will itwork onmultiple targets, and will itwork down tozero range? Itishoped that thelatter part ofthis chapter will have answered the question asked atthebeginning astowhether there areany uses forthe sYstems here described.
Naturally, ageneral answer cannot begiven astowhen c-wsystems areindicated—we canonly suggest acareful study oftherequirements and acomparison ofthepotentialities ofthevarious types ofsystems.
Perhaps theonly useful general remark istheobvious one that c-w systems aremost useful onproblems where pulse systems fail!For example, ifone wants tomeasure arange of10ftapulse system would hardly besuggested; that described inSec.
5“8 would have notrouble.
Also this c-w system will measure such short ranges much more accurately than pulse systems.
Orsuppose the velocity of abullet iswanted-the system described inSec.

Influence ofOperational Requirements.
I—The purpose ofany radar system istopresent information onthepositions oftargets within the volume ofspace itsurveys.
The nature ofsuch targets, their number, and the character ofthe information required about them will depend profoundly onthe function which the radar iscalled upon to perform.
For example, the radar altimeter used inaircraft deals with only one target—the surface ofthe earth beneath the planeand offers only onedatum—the minimum distance ofthealtimeter from that target.
Aradar system used forcontrol ofairtraffic near alanding field, on the other hand, must display the range, bearing, and altitude ofall aircraft within ornear the boundaries ofthe control zone.
Atagiven moment, there may bemore than ahundred individual targets, for each ofwhich the radar must provide sufficiently accurate positional information toenable controllers toissue prompt instructions topilots.
Radar equipments suitable forsuch different purposes will present wide differences indesign.
This chapter and the next deal with the principal fundamental differences that appear invarious conventional pulse radar designs.
Inthis chapter the effect ofoperational require- ments onthe design ofthe radar itself isconsidered; inthe next isdis- cussed themore difficult question oforganizing thefacilities and services required tointerpret and make use ofthe data provided byradar.
The most important and fundamental ofthe radar design differences that arise from different functional requirements are those which con- cern the beam pattern produced bythe antenna, the arrangements for scanning acertain volume ofspace with that beam, and theindicator or indicators necessary todisplay thepositions oftargets detected.
Because ofthe extremely close interrelationship among these three factors, and because allthree areprincipally determined bythefunctional aim ofthe radar equipment, itwould appear desirable tobegin with adiscussion of the various radar functions, showing foreach the choice ofthese three factors which experience has sofarrecommended.

TYPES OFRADAR INDICATORS BYL.J.HAWORTHafter this catalogue 62.
Definitions.-The device that presents radar data inobservable form iscalled the indicator.
Itisusually acathode-ray tube; alter- natively itmay bealoudspeaker ortelephone headset, aflashing light, amoving-coil meter, orapen-and-ink recorder.
The cathode-ray tube (CRT) permits aninterpretation ofelectrical phenomena interms ofapicture painted onaphosphorescent screen bya sharply focused beam ofelectrons controlled inposition and intensity by electrical signals.
Itiscapable ofusing and displaying many millions ofseparate data persecond.
The geometrical expression which theCRT gives toelectrical phenomena ispeculiarly appropriate toradar, because ageometrical situation involving the various radar targets isprecisely what must usually berepresented.
Ofthe other devices mentioned as possible indicators, only the pen-and-ink recorder iscapable ofgiving such ageometrical interpretation, and itisslow and cumbersome by comparison.
Thus, inspite ofcertain inadequacies, acathode-ray tube isused asthe radar indicator inallsituations that involve any appreciable target complexity.
The picture presented onthetube face iscalled the indication, the display, orthe presentation.
The tube itself isreferred toasthe indicator, indicator tube,display tube,CRT,orscope.
When a tube presenting aparticular form ofdisplay istobeidentified, adescrip- tive adjective orcode designation isprefixed to“scope.” The word indicator isoften extended toinclude devices and circuits auxiliary to thecathode-ray tube.
Both magnetic and electrostatic cathode-ray tubes are used (Sec.
13.1).
Intheir design every effort has been made toachieve the optimum inresolution, light intensity, deflection sensitivity, and com- pactness.
The materials (phosphors) used inthescreen areofparticular importance.
If,asisusually thecase, thescanning interrupts thepicture forlonger than theretentivity time oftheeye, itisnecessary tointroduce persistence into the screen.
Screens ofvarious rates ofdecay areavail- able forthis purpose.
The detailed characteristics ofthetubes, including thescreens, will bediscussed inSees.

62 Informing the displays, radar echo signals may beused either to displace (deflection-modulate) the electron beam, asinthe ordinary oscilloscope, ortointensify (intensity-modulate) it,asisdone intelevision.
Deflection modulation affords precise information about the strength and character ofthe signals delivered bythe receiver, but leaves only one dimension ofthetube face free torepresent ageometrical quantity.
Onthe other hand, intensity modulation permits the presentation ofa two-dimensional figure onwhich the signals appear asbright spots or patches, but offers only qualitative information about signal intensity.
The CRT screen cannot present any true three-dimensional picture, ofcourse; this isthe most fundamental limitation ofthe cathode-ray tube asaradar indicator.
Under very simple conditions, itispossibl~ topresent athird dimension inanunderstandable though unnatural way, but inany complicated three-dimensional situation one isforced touse more than one display.
The fundamental geometrical quantities involved inradar displays are the spherical coordinates ofthe target measured from the origin atthe radar antenna: range, azimuth angle (orbearing), and elevation angle.
Practical] yevery radar display uses one ortwo ofthese quanti- ties directly ascoordinates onthe tube face, orisasimple modification ofadisplay which does.
The vast majority ofdisplays use asone coordinate the value of slant range, itshorizontal projection (ground range), oritsvertical projection (altitude).
Since slant range isinvolved inevery radar situa- tion, itinevitably appears inatleast one display onevery set.
Itisthe coordinate most frequently duplicated when more than one type of display isused byagiven radar set, partly because displays presenting range have the greatest signal-to-noise discrimination, and partly for geometrical reasons.
Range isdisplayed bycausing the electron beam ofthe CRT to move (sweep) across the tube atauniform rate Istarting f1om agiven point orline atadefinite time ineach pulse cycle.
Thus, distances on the tube face along this rangesweeportimebaseare proportional to increments ofslant range.
The scale Jactorrelates distances onthe tube toactual range, and the sweeplengthisthe distance represented; both are determined byspeed ofthe sweep.
The origin ofrange may beonoroffthetube face; sometimes thestart ofthesweep isdelayed for some time after theinstant oftransmission oftheoutgoing pulse.
The angle inwhich the scanner ispointing, either inazimuth or slevation, may enter into adisplay (1)directly asapolar angle, (2) IThe range sweep must benonuniform when itisdesired toproject range ina plane notcontaining theradar set;as,forexample, inthecaseoftrueground mapping ontheindicator ofanairborne radar.

This will befurther discussed incon- nection with specific types ofdisplay.
Indices orScaleMarkers.-Both mechanical and electrical means areused formaking geometrical meamrements onthedisplays.
Inmeasuring range, “electronic” range markers are practically always used.
These consist ofartificial video signals introduced into thedisplay byaprecision timing circuit; thus, inaccuracies inthedisplay donot enter assources oferror inthe measurements.
Almost every display entails asetofdiscrete, regularly spaced markers derived from anoscillator properly phased with respect tothefiring ofthemodulator.
Fairly accurate ranges can beread from these markers ataglance.
In many cases, however, interpolation errors arelarger than canbetolerated; thefixed markers arethen supplemented byamanually controlled, con- tinuously movable, calibrated index.
This index has the advantage of extremely high precision, especially onanexpanded sweep, but itrequires appreciable time initsuse.
Mechanical indices which move infront ofthe CRT face areseldom used inmeasuring range.
For the determination ofangle, ithas been most usual inthe past touse mechanical indices: either asetoffixed indices engraved ona transparent overlay, oramovable mechanical cursor.
These can give errors due toparallax and toinaccuracies inthedisplay.
More recently, electronic indices have begun toreplace mechanical range markers.
A discrete setoffixed indices, oracontinuously variable index, may be provided; forsome techniques ofdisplay synthesis, thelatter isnot easy toachieve.
The controls ofmovable markers, bo~h ofrange and ofangle, are often connected todevices providing remote data transmission.
6.3.
Summary ofIndicator Type s.-Many considerations enter into thechoice ofthedisplay geometry.
Inathree-dimensional problem, the designer must decide how todivide thecoordinates between two displays, orhow topresent alltheinformation onasingle display, ifthis isfeasible.
Even atwo-dimensional display iscomplicated, and often involves con- flicting requirements, such asthe need forhigh resolution inangle and range ]vithout sacrifice inthe total field of~iew.
Insome cases, the needs can best bemet bydeliberately deforming the picture; inothers itmay benecessary tousemore than one display, either alternately ona single tube orsimultaneously ondifferent ones.
Many different display schemes have been invented todeal with these problems.
The following summary, which classifies them according tothe spatial geometry represented, includes the important geometries actually used.
Although many others arepossible, they have had little ornopractical application todate. 164THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA (SEC.

6.4.
One-dimensional Deflection-modulated Display s.—Since one- dimensional displays yield little geometrical information, their only justification isthat they permit the use ofdeflection modulation, which gives amaximum ofinformation about the intensity and form ofthe echo signals.
For this purpose, itisbest todisplay the signals asa function oftime orrange, and thus the only displays using deflection modulation arethose inwhich the deflections areapplied perpendicular toarange sweep (Fig.
6“1).
This sweep may represent either asmall part ornearly allofthe period between successive pulses.
Inthe former case, the particular range interval that appears onthe display isdetermined bythe delay elapsing between the transmission ofthe outgoing pulse and the starting ofthe range sweep.
The general classification “type A” isused todescribe one-dimen- sional displays.
An A-scope isuniversally used for observing radar signals and various circuit waveforms inaradar set during test and alignment.
Itmay beeither part ofthe permanent installation ora piece ofportable test equipment.

Representation ofthe Horizontal Plane .—The large radius of curvature ofthe earth and theshallowness ofthelayer ofairabove itiu which conventional aircraft are accustomed toflymake ituseful to project allsignals from radar targets inahorizontal plane.
Most radar sets use asim~le azimuth scan (with abeam that isfanned somewhat inthevertical direction ifaircraft aretobeobserved), and present their data onatwo-dimensional intensity-modulated display.
Even when target height isimportant, some’ sort ofrange-azimuth display isusually basic tothe indication system.
The third coordinate usually appears inaseparate presentation onanother tube, often asaprojection of alltargets onavertical plane.
Intensity-modulated displays ofplane surfaces constitute themost important class ofradar indicators.
ThePlan-position Indicator.—If the slant range and azimuth coordi- nates ofthe various targets inthefield ofview arerepresented, respec- tively, bydistance from the center ofaCRT and byazimuth onthe tube face, theresult isamap.

Except when viewing aircraft atvery substantial elevation angles, orwhen mapping theground from ahigh-flying aircraft, this error isimperceptible and can beneglected under practically all circumstances.
The indicator used forthe display just described iscalled the plan- position indicator orPPI.’ Inthe PPI, anoutward range sweep is rotated about the range origin insynchronism with the azimuthal scanning ofthe antenna.
Targets then appear inthe proper directions aswell asattheproper relative distances from thk origin and theresult isamap.

The expression sedtordisplay isoften used when the dis- placement isextreme.
The PPI isthe most widely used and versatile ofalldisplays.
In presenting the information with which itdeals, itsonly fundamental shortcoming isthat, incommon with allmaps orcharts, itcannot simul- taneously possess ahighly expanded scale and alarge field ofview.
The vertical analogue ofthePPI may beformed bysubstituting ele- vation for azimuth angle.
However, since only arestricted range of elevation angle usually hasinterest, itismore customary tousedistorted displays forthis purpose.

6,5] REPRESENTATION OF THE HORIZONTAL PLANE 169 Inspite ofthe usefulness ofatrue map display such asthe PPI, occasions arise inwhich itisnotideal.
These situations usually involve the need forproviding high resolution ordispersion insome particular coordinate without restricting the field ofview too severely inother dimensions.
Anumber oftypes ofdeformed displays have been devised for such purposes, and are particularly useful indealing with point targets.
Radial Deformation.—A polar plot such asthe PPI can bedeformed radially byshifting therange origin, byusing anonlinear range scale, or both.
The first means has been widely used.
Onanormal PPI itisdifficult todetermine accurately the direction toatarget whose range isasmall fraction ofthat covered bythedisplay.
This difficulty isoften partly overcome byexpanding the zero-range origin ofthePPI into acircle sothat the radius vector tothe echo from a nearby target isgreatly increased.
Such anarrangement isknown asan open-center PPI.
Range and bearing retain their identities and their linear scales.
Forthedegree ofcenter-open- ing ordinarily used, the deformation introduced into thesizes, shapes, and relative positions ofthe targets is serious for only afractional part of therange portrayed.
Anopen-center PPI has been widely employed for station-keeping and for homing on such objects asships, airplanes, run- ways, and thelike.

Itissometimes desirable toprovide anexpanded range scale over an interval atadistance from theradar site without sacrificing anall-round view asanoff-center PPI would do.
This may beaccomplished by delaying and expanding therange sweep inanotherwise normal PPI so that aring-shaped area iscollapsed into asolid circle.
Because ofthe technique used inproducing it,this display iscalled adelayed PPI.
As intheopen-center PPI, range and bearing retain their identities and their linearity.
The deformation isvery great except atthe extreme edge of thedisplay.
The delayed PPI isused toincrease theresolution onclosely spaced targets and oncoded beacon signals, tofacilitate accurate range measurements, and toincrease the signal-to-noise orsignal-to-clutter discernibility under some circumstances. ~70 THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTA TIONOFRADAR DATA [SEC.
6.5 Linear Deformation.—A deformed display ofconsiderable utility, especially inthe vertical plane, can beformed by“stretching” apolar plot inone rectangular dimension asthough itwere onasheet ofrubber.
Onsuch adisplay, the cartesian coordinates parallel and perpendicular totheaxis ofstretch retain their original meaning and their linearity, but they have different scale factors.
Straight lines remain straight but, except for those parallel tothe coordinate axes, their directions are changed.
Circles ofequal range appear asellipses with their major axes inthedirection ofthestretch.
Inthe horizontal plane this geometry, called the stretched PPI’(Fig.
6.6), isuseful principally incon- nection with the control from a remote point ofaircraft approach- ingalanding, orships navigating achannel.
The stretching, done inadirection perpendicular tothe desired course, aids greatly inde- tecting slight deviations therefrom.
This technique finds itsgreat- est utility inthe vertical plane where vertical stretching isused toenhance theaccuracy ofaircraft height determination (see discus- sion ofRHI, Sec.
6.6).
Rectangular Presentation of Range and Angle.—A plane sur- face isoften represented inade- formed manner by combining range and angle incartesian rather than inpolar coordinates.
This isaccomplished bymoving arange sweep laterally across thetube face in synchronism with theantenna motion sothat the origin isstretched out into aline.
Inrange and azimuth these rectangular displays areoftwo different sorts: 1.Displays inwhich noattempt ismade tominimize thedeformation, either because itisunimportant inthe particular circumstances, orbecause certain advantages canbegained byneglecting it.
Any desired range interval and azimuthal sector may becovered, although inpractice more than 180° israrely used.

Insome older sets, the E-scope isused forheight indication, but itsdis- tortion and itspoor height dispersion atlarge ranges make itinferior to theRHI forthis purpose.

EXAMPLES OFTHE MAJOR OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 6.9.
Early Aircraft-warning Radar.
l—The British HomeChain.—The first radar tohave actual combat usewas theBritish CH (Chain, Home) equipment.
Work was begun in1936 toward setting upfive stations, about 25miles apart, toprotect London and theThames estuary, and by thetime war broke outin1939 this Chain had been extended tocover the greater part ofthe south and east coasts ofEngland and Scotland.
During thenext few years theChain was extended and itsequipment and performance were improved.
Inspite oftheintroduction ofmore modern and efficient equipment, the Chain provided the basis ofthe British 1ByB.V.Bowden andL.N.Ridenour. 176 THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA [SEC..69 reporting system forthegreater part ofthewar.
Atthevery end ofthe war the system was used toplot V-2 rockets.
The great success ofthe equipment, which saved the country from defeat during the Battle of Britain, had animportant effect onthecourse ofradar development.
It called attention tothe revolutionary usefulness ofradar inmodern air warfare, but atthe same time ittended tofreeze operational thinking ccmcerning radar along lines ofthe static defense which was allthat the CH stations could provide.
The main Chain operated atfrequencies between 22and 28Me/see.
Inspite ofthe disadvantages inevitable inany system operating onso low afrequency, the choice was made deliberately after consideration of thetubes and techniques available atthetime.
‘(Throughout thewhole ofthedevelopment period thesmall team who were responsible ruthlessly sacrificed allrefinements, elegancies and versatilities in thedesperate need forsomething tobegoing onwith.

”1 Atthe frequency used, strong reflections from the ionosphere occur, and anextremely low repetition rate of25pps was used inorder toensure that ionospheric echoes were not confused with echoes from aircraft targets.
The repetition rate could bereduced to12.5 pps when iono- spheric disturbances were unusually troublesome.
The pulse width could bevaried from 6toabout 25~sec and the receiver bandwidth could bechanged from 50to500 kc/see.
Innormal operation the pulse length was about 12~sec and the bandwidth 150 kc/see, The final design made use ofcontinuously evacuated transmit- ting tubes with uncoated tungsten filaments, whose c-wpower output was about 80kw.
Peak pulse power using these tubes was about 150 kw; later, itwas increased toabout one megawatt.
Both transmitters and receivers were massive and elaborate.
They were housed inseparate bombproof buildings, usually about half amile apart.
Separate antennas were used fortransmitting and receiving.
The main transmitting antenna was anarray, usually ofsixdipoles with suitable tuned reflectors, hung between two gantries ona350-ft steel tower.
These towers were usually installed insets ofthree inorder to provide spare antennas and standby frequencies.
RadiaLion from the transmitting antenna floodlit aquarter-sphere infront ofthestation, the qreater part ofthe energy being confined within 20° ofthe horizontal and within approximate yt50° ofthe main “line ofshoot.

These reflectors could beswitched inoroutofcircuit byremote control from theground.
From their effect onthe echo, the operator could deduce whether the target was infront oforbehind thestation.
The performance ofCH stations was controlled bythe reflections from theground ofboth thetransmitted and thereceived signals.
The antenna patterns ofthe transmitting and receiving arrays were not identical and there were large gaps inthevertical coverage ofthestations.
Inorder tominimize the importance ofthe gaps, separate auxiliary ‘‘gap-filling” transmitting and receiving arrays were installed toallow aircraft tobefollowed through the gaps produced bythe main arrays (see Figs.
6.14 and 6.15).
Itwas desirable that theground surrounding a station should beflatforseveral miles inevery direction; fewstations had really ;deal sites.
Ilven when allpossible precautions had been taken, 178 THE GATHERING AND PRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA iSEC.69 station performance was never predictable from theory.
Itwas always necessary to“calibrate” astation byanelaborate series oftest flights.
The maximum reliable range ofaCH station was usually about 120 to150miles onsingle aircraft, but therange depended very much onthe skill oftheoperator and ofthemaintenance crew aswell asonmeteoro- 40,000// 330,000///.s /z20,000 - /,* =10,000 -.“ ~.//-/ O10‘;O- ’30 40 5060 7080 90100 110120 Rangeinmiles FIG.

Ifone compares the signals received inthese two antennas asafunction of angle ofelevation, oneobtains acurve shown dotted inFig.

Itfollows that, bymeasuring the signal ratio, itissometimes possible todeduce the angle ofelevation ofthe target.
The comparison was performed by means ofthe goniometer already described.
Under normal circumstances, the field coils ofthe tzoniometer were connected totwo dipoles about 22o ftabove theground.
Bymeans ofa switch, one goniometer coil was connected toadipole at22o ft,theother toadipole atabout 90ft.
Byturning thegoniometer togive minimum signal, theangle ofelevation ofthetarget could bedetermined and hence itsheight could bededuced (see Fig.
6.17). f$Ec.
69] EARLY AIRCRAFT-WARNING RADAR 179 Measurements ofangles ofelevation above about 7°were ambiguous onthis so-called “A” system, and measurements ofangles below about 1° were inaccurate owing tothe “flatness” ofthe height curve forthese small angles.
The maximum usable angle ofelevation was extended by using two receiving antennas 90ftand 45fthigh respectively (the “B” system).

Some stations could measure height only inone ortwo favorable azimuths.
The operations involved inapplying azimuth errors and interpreting height measurements were performed automatically byasystem of standard telephone selector switches and kelays.
The operator measured r“ange byapointer onthe tube, azimuth byturning thp goniometer to give zero response from theecho.
Shel then pressed abutton and the grid reference (Chap.
7)ofthetarget appeared onaboard.
The operator then switched toheight-finding, turned thegoniometer again and pressed abutton, whereupon theheight was displayed infront oftheteller.
If theheight measurement was ambiguous orunreliable, that fact was shown bythe machine, and the operator could try again onthe “B” height system.
Operational useofradar information isdiscussed inChap.
7, The shortcomings ofthe CH system are fairly clear.
Its long wavelength necessitated the use oflarge and expensive towers.
There 1After 1940 almost alloperators were women. 180 THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA [%C.69 were large gaps initsvertical coverage (Figs.
6.14 and 615).
The range onlow-flying aircraft was poor.
The system was supplemented in1940 by200-Mc/sec equipment, the so-called “CHL” (Chain, Home, Low) system.
Itwas often very difficult tofind sites that were flat enough forstations.
Since thestation atDover was ona400-ft cliff and Ventnor was onacliff 1000 ftabove thesea, itwas im~ossible forthese stations to measure height atall.
The processes involved indeducing theplan posi- tion and.
theheight ofanaircraft were complicated and notvery reliable.
The maximum traffic-handling capacity was low (agood operator could pass about 6plots perminute), and the system could not keep track of large numbers ofindependently routed aircraft.
Nevertheless, forma- tions ofaircraft were plotted reliably, and the number ofaircraft inh formation could beestimated byanexperienced operator.
With allits imperfections, this s’ystem was the basis ofthe British radar defense for the greater part ofthewar.
!!’he CXAM.—While theBritish Home Chain was being designed and installed, theArmy and Navy development agencies intheUnited States were independently developing pulse radar equipment.
The earliest service equipment tobecommercially manufactured was the CXAM radar, designed atthe Naval Research Laboratory.
Alaboratory-built prototype ofthis settvas tested atseaduring battle maneuvers inearly 1939, aboard the U.S.S.NewYork,and itsperformance was sopromising that acontract was letinOctober 1939 forthemanufacture ofsixsets of similar equipment.
The CXAM was operationally quite different from theCH.
Instead ofusing separate, fixed, broad-beam transmitting and receiving arrays, itemployed acommon antenna fortransmitting and receiving.
Topro- duce asnarrow asbeam aspossible, itoperated atthe then ultrahigh frequency of195 Me/see, and employed a“mattress” array ofdipoles with reflectors, giving again of40and abeam 14°wide inazimuth by about 70°inelevation.
The antenna could berotated inazimuth ata speed of5rpm, ormanually trained tofollow aparticular target.
The peak pulse power was 15kw, the pulsewidth 3psec, and the repetition rate 1640 pps.
Range against bombers was about 70miles, against fighters about 50miles.
The display was anA-scope inwhich the trace was lengthened by causing the sweep totake place from left toright across the tube, then drop down and return from right tolem Range was estimated with the help ofmarks onthe face ofthe tube; bearing was determined as the direction ofantenna-pointing which yielded maximum signal.
The height oftargets could beestimated with thehelp ofnulls inthevertical antenna pattern (Sec.

InAugust 1940 acontract forquantity production ofthis equipment was let. 182 THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA [SEC.
6.10 The setwas built both formobile use (SCR-270) and forfixed-station installation (SCR-271).
During thegeneral advance inradar technique, the setwent through many detailed changes and improvements and was still inactive useattheclose ofthe Japanese war.
The SCR-2701 and theCXAM arequite similar intheir operating fea- tures.
The SCR-270 operates atafrequency of106 Me/see, has apeak power of100 kw, apulsewidth from 10to25psec, and areliable range against single bombing aircraft ofmore than 100 miles.
The repetition rate is621 pps.
The same antenna isused forboth transmission and reception.
This antenna (Fig.
6.18) consists ofadipole array originally four dipoles +de and nine high, with areflector; theantenna gain is140 and the beamwidths 28° inazimuth and 10°inelevation.
Provision is made either forcontinuous rotation oftheantenna at1rpm orformanual training tomaximize target signals.
The SCR-270 has anA-scope display, with acontrol forsovarying thestart ofthesweep that aselected target signal canbebrought under a marker ontheface ofthetube; ascale onthe phasing control then indl- cates target range directly.
Target bearing isdetermined byreading off the antenna azimuth when theecho signal from the target inquestion appears tobestrongest.
The azimuth accuracy depends onproper siting, asinthe case ofallradar making use ofground reflections, and attainable accuracy inpractice isabout +4°.
Height-finding can be performed bythe method ofnulls (Sec.
6.11).
Later models ofthis setinclude, among other improvements, anantenna giving abeam narrower inazimuth, and aPPI indicator.
The simplicity, reliability, and ruggedness oftheSCR-270 made itavery useful and very widely used equipment despite itsgreat bulk and weight, itspoor low- angle coverage, itsvulnerability toground clutter inanything less than a very carefully chosen site, itslack ofrange resolution and azimuth dis- crimination, and itslow traffic-handling capacity.

PPI Radar for Search, Control, and Pilotage.’-In the last section, animportant historical development has been traced.
The first radar setsused fixed antennas and floodlighting technique, and required that amanipulation beperformed tofind the azimuth ofeach target.
Next were designed relatively narrow-beam, continuously scan- ning radars, inwhich each target inthefield ofview isdisplayed period- ically, sothat itsazimuth and range can beread offatregular intervals.
Afurther step was made with thedevelopment oftheplan-position indi- cator, orPPI, which, although theradar beam was still narrow and still 1Since theradar design oftheSCR-270 does notdiffer from that oftheSCR-271, thedesignation SCR-270 willbeused, asamatter ofconvenience, tostand foreither equipment.

6.10]PPI RADAR FOR SEARCH, CONTROL, AND PILOTAGE 183 showed instantaneously only those targets located inanarrow azimuth sector, made useofthepersistent property ofCRT screen phosphors to preserve from one scan toanother the target signals returned onthe most recent scan.
The PPI thus presents acontinuous map-like display ofalltargets inthefield ofview ofitsradar, and permits attention tobe concentrated onparticular targets without thepenalty oflosing sight of thegeneral situation.
Itisinteresting tonotice that, before theadvent ofthePPI, users of such equipment asthe CXAIU and theSCR-270 frequently constructed aplan display with pencil and paper, plotting inpolar coordinates the targets whose range and azimuth were called offbythe radar operator.
Further, skilled operators ofsuch sets developed anability toform, by watching the.A-scope, asort ofmental PPI picture ofthe radar targets, remembering from scan toscan their ranges and bearing angles.
When thePPI became available, the operator was released from this necessity, and could apply hisskills toamore sophisticated mental appreciation ofthetarget situation; forexample, agood PPI operator will often keep inhismind thedirections inwhich important targets aremoving.
With theexception ofspecial-purpose sets allradar equipment designed in1941 orlater contained one ormore PPI scopes.
Inmany types of equipment theuseofthePPI isfundamental tothepurpose oftheradar.
PPI rticlar sets can bedivided into three classes: land-based, shipborne, orairborne.
Ground-based PPI sets are usually employed forthe detection and plotting ofaircraft, either togive early warning ofenemy airactivity, or tocontrol friendly aircraft byradio instructions, orboth.
Mounted on shore, such sets canalso beused forplotting ship traffic topermit warning and control, but this use issimply atwo-dimensional case ofthe same problem asthat involved inplotting aircraft.
Inwartime, radar sets orishipboard must provide air-search and con- trol facilities, and inaddition must give adisplay ofsurface targets, to permit station-keeping information and pilotage innarrow waters under conditions ofpoor visibility.
Inpeacetime, usually only the surface- search function isofimportance.
Because ofthe different beam-shape requirements, separate radar systems areordinarily used forairsearch and forsurface search, Airborne radar equipments employing aPPI areused forpilotage in thevicinity ofshorelines orover land.

The only drawback ofmicrowave radar for ship search istheresultant narrowing ofthebeam inelevation; inorder to keep therolling ofthe ship from tilting thebeam away from the surface ofthe sea, either the antenna mount must bemechanically stabilized (Chap.
9),orthe vertical dimensions oftheantenna must bereduced to fan the beam sufficiently inelevation totake account ofroll.
Inair- borne PPI radar, the attainment ofsufficiently good display detail to permit navigation over land, away from distinctive shorelines, demands the use ofmicrowave frequencies.
Infact, aconsiderable premium is placed onattainment ofthe narrowest azimuth beamwidth possible.
Antenna stabilization isalso desirable inaircraft, tocorrect fortheeffects ofchanges inattitude; but itissocostly inweight and complication that ithas been seldom used.

Height-finding Involving Ground Reflection.-The height of anaircraft target isusually determined byfinding separately itsrange and itsangle ofelevation, and then solving the equation H=Rsine.
Inthe wartime use ofradar, height was such animportant datum that considerable ingenuity was expended onthe problem ofits measurement.
The resulting methods can beroughly separated into two classes depending onwhether the reflection ofenergy from the level surface surrounding theradar antenna isimportant tothescheme ofheight-find- ing used.

6.11] HEIGHT-FINDING INVOLVING GROUND REFLECTION 185 isapproximately directly toward thestation, therange atwhich the first fade isseen isalso determined bythe target height.
Ifseveral fade points aredetermined, the height can beinferred with better accuracy.
This method has been used extensively with the 200-M c/sec aircraft- search radar used onnaval vessels.
Itisespecially useful ~vith this type ofradar because theelevation pattern can bewell known (the ocean isa good reflector, and theantenna height isdetermined bythe class ofship and notbytheshape oftheterrain), and because aradial approach toa task force isgenerally chosen byeither enemy orfriend.
Height-finding bynulls, however, has inherent drawbacks which seriously reduce itsaccuracy inoperational use.
The elevation pattern ofaground-based set must becarefully calibrated experimentally, because thereflection coefficient ofthesurrounding ground will determine thepattern, and because uneven ground gives different elevation patterns atdifferent azimuths.
Further, changes inthe aspect presented tothe radar bythe aircraft may cause great changes intheecho strength.

The method isslow; areading cannot bemade inless time than that required foraplane toflythrough several nulls ofthepattern.
This drawback, and the elaborate calibration necessary atanoverland site, have ledtothedevelopment ofother height-finding means, even forlong- wave radar sets.
SignalComparison.—A more rapid and convenient means ofheight- finding which isalso based ontheexistence ofmaxima and minima inthe elevation pattern ofalong-wave radar employing ground reflection is signal comparison.
Two ormore antenna systems with different eleva- tion patterns areprovided atasingle radar station, and theintensity of the echo received onone antenna iscompared with that received on another.

From the relative in- tensities and therange oftheaircraft, height can bededuced.
For either lobe pattern, theelectric field strength atthe target depends onthe phase difference between the direct and reflected beams, and so will vary nearly sinusoidally with the altitude ofthe target.

The ratio vanes slowly forsmall elevation angles, then rapidly asthe lower lobe just touches theaircraft—in this case atanelevation angle of about 4°.

Atlow angles thevariation ofratio with angle isfartoo slow.
Atangles near 4°the variation isfast, but theillumination oftheplane bythelower beam may besoweak that no echo isobtained, and therefore noheight can beinferred.
Ifboth the antennas arenearer the ground, the effective angle isincreased, but the beams areboth tipped upsomuch that coverage onaircraft atlow and medium altitude issacrificed.
Even inthecase wehave considered, an aircraft 10,000 fthigh and 50miles away, orone 5000 fthigh atarange of25miles, would fallintheunmeasurable class.
To overcome these limitations, avariety ofoverlapping elevation lobe patterns aremade available byproviding avariety ofantennas with phase and antiphase feeding.
This additional complexity increases the time required tofind height, since ifthe operator cannot guess which combination ofantennas issuitable, awrong choice makes itnecessary forhim towait forafull 360° rotation ofthe antenna mount before he can tryabetter pair.
Inaddition tothe elaboration necessary inequipment for height- finding bythis method, siting isalso aproblem.
Asuitable site should belevel within afew feet forahalf-mile radius around theradar.
Even seareflection can betroublesome, because tides cause aprofound change inthe calibration ofthestation asaheight finder.
For these reasons, a free-space-beam height finder, not depending onground reflection, is usually preferred.

Height-6nding with aFree-space Beam.’ Searchlighting.
—The simplest form offree-space-beam height finder isone which measures elevation angle ofthe desired target directly, bypointing anantenna producing anarrow beam directly atthetarget and measuring theeleva- tion angle atthe antenna mount.
This technique iscalled “search- lighting.” Even with centimeter wavelengths, beamwidths attainable with antenna reflectors ofpracticable size (afew degrees) are large in comparison with the accuracy desired inthe measurement ofelevation angle (about atenth ofadegree) forheight-finding purposes.
Therefore, target height isnot usually determined bydirecting the beam atthe target simply bymaximizing theecho.
Instead, arrangements aremade forshifting the beam rapidly inele- vation angle byanamount which may be,typically, athird ofabeam- width, and comparing the echo signal received inone position with that intheother.
When thetwo signals areequal, the bisector ofthe angle between the two positions ofthe beam ispointed directly atthetarget.
The signals from agiven target may becompared forthe two positions ofthe beam bypresenting them side-by-side onatype Kindicator or 1ByE.C.Pollard, L.N.Ridenour, andD.C.Soper. 188 THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA [SEC.

Asimple means formoving the beam inelevation angle istorotate thebeam rapidly about anaxis which makes asmall angle with thecenter line ofthebeam; this iscalled “conical scanning.” Itwill beseen that a conical scan permits the simultaneous determination not only ofthe elevation error inpointing the axis ofthe scan atthe target, but also of the azimuth error insuch pointing.
Full consideration ofthis method forangular tracking ofasingle target isdeferred toSec.
6.14, but itwill beuseful here todescribe afew principal features ofaradar that employs conical scan solely forthepurpose ofheight-finding.
This principle was used inthe British CMH, amobile 10-cm equip- ment designed specifically for height-finding.
Itused a6-ft dish, a power of500kw, and was capable ofmeasuring heights towithin ~500ft.
The aircraft tobemeasured was followed manually inrange with the aidofanelectronic marker ontherange trace.
Two other operators fol- lowed manually inazimuth and elevation.
The range and elevation settings were used tooperate anautomatic height indicator which could beplaced inaremote position adjacent, toaPPI fedbyanauxiliary search radar.
Only afew ofthese equipments were built owing toprogress inthe development ofacentimetric scanning system, and totheinherent inabil- ityofthe CMHtofind height onmore than one target atatime.
The SCR-615 was asimilar U.S.
equipment, except that itwas designed asa fixed installation and employed an8-ft dish.
The SM equipment used bythe U.S.
Navy was perhaps the most widely used ofallied radar sets inthis category.
Itwas employed in conjunction with suitable PPI radar forship control ofaircraft.
Its wavelength is10.7 cm, and itemploys anantenna reflector 8ftindiam- eter.
The waveguide feed used isalittle offtheaxis oftheparaboloid, sothat thebeam, whose width is3°,isoffaxis by1°.
The feed isrotated toproduce the conical scan.
Pulses from theupper half oftheantenna rotation arecompared with those from the lower half bymeans ofinte- grating circuits, and theoutput difference isused todisplace thespot ofan error indicator (Sec.
6.8).
APPI isprovided forgeneral reporting, and two range scopes, one covering the full range ofthe setand one an expanded A-scope, make itpossible todetermine target range and to eliminate from thesignal-comparison circuits allechoes except those from thetarget whose altitude isbeing determined.
Inoperation, either ahelical scan (Sec.
9.7) oracontinuous rotation in azimuth with manually controlled elevation can beused insearching for targets.
The helical scan can besettocover any 12°inelevation angle intherange from 3°below to75°above thehorizon.

The target islocated onthe full-range A-scope, and therange interval covered bytheexpanded A-scope adjusted toinclude the target.
Aportion ofthe sweep ofthe expanded A-scope isdeflected downward toform a“ditch” (Fig.
6.2c).
Only signals received during the range interval represented bythis “ditch” are fed tothe integrating circuits which control the spot error indicator.
The setting oftheexpanded A-scope isadjusted until thedesired signal isin the “ditch,” and the antenna pointing isadjusted tocenter the error indicator.
When this has been done, the elevation angle ofthe line of sight tothetarget can beread offrepeater dials which indicate theeleva- tion angle ofthemount.

Elevation Scanning.—The height-finding methods sofar described arealllimited inaccuracy, inspeed ofheight-reading, orinthenumber of targets which can bedealt with atonce byasingle height-finding radar.
The advantages ofasystem inwhich anarrow beam scans inelevation and the signals are displayed directly onanintensity-modulated tube whose coordinates arederived from range and elevation angle areappar- ent.
These very important advantages were clear before themicrowave radar arthad advanced tothepoint where itwas possible toobtain nar- row beams and adequate range performance with reasonably small antenna structures.
Asaresult, theBritish developed asystem operated at200 Me/see which provided elevation scanning with afixed antenna.
Itwas called Variable Elevation Beam (VEB).
Two versions were developed, one using a240-ft mast and theother a120-ft mast, thelatter being intended forrapid installation.
Such tall structures were necessary inorder to obtain anarrow beamwidt hinelevation atthis low frequency.
The antenna system ona240-ft mast consists ofnine groups, each ofeight horizontal dipoles, spaced vertically one above another.
This version scans over arange ofelevation angle from ~to7#.
The beam- tilting isachieved byaltering the relative phasing ofthe groups of dipoles; each group isfed from amechanical phase shifter mounted in thecenter ofthemast.
The banks ofdipoles can betilted mechanically 190 THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA [SEC.612 tomove the scanning range tothe elevation interval from 7# to15°.

—Despite thespeed, convenience, and accuracy oftheelevation-scanning height finders just described, these sets are merely auxiliary toasearch radar.

Two ormore radar systems can becombined toallow continuous and rapid indication ofboth plan position and height ofalltargets in thefield ofview.
One example of such aradar isaship~based set which combines aconventional PPI radar with anelevation-scan height finder ofadvanced design.
Another, working onquite adiffer- ent principle, istheV-beam radar, which reduces the measurement of height totwo measurements oftar- get-azimuth.
The ship radar uses asearch setand aheight finder whose antennas occupy thesame pedestal.
The search sethas abeamwidth inazimuth of1.5° and elevation coverage upto15°.
The height finder antenna is 15fthigh by5ftwide, fedat8.9-cm wavelength byaspecial feed (Sec.

Homing.’-The useofairborne radar toguide anaircraft toits target was extremely important during the Ivar.
Long-wave radar installed inaircraft isscarcely capable ofperforming an,y function more complicated than homing, since theenormous size ofanantenna giving a beam sharp enough toproduce amap-type display precludes itsuse in aircraft.
Fortunately forthe wartime development ofairborne radar, homing isatactically important function both intheattack ofshipping byaircraft and inthe interception ofhostile aircraft by defending fighters.
Sets forboth purposes operating near 200 Me/see were exten- sively used during thewar.
Homing onaSwjace Target.—The simpler ofthetwo problems isthat ofthe detection and interception ofshipping bypatrol aircraft.
Since targets areknown tobeonthe surface ofthe sea, homing information need besupplied only inazimuth.
The first operationally successful aircraft-to-surface-vessel, ASV, radar was theBritish ASV lMark II.
A counterpart ofthis equipment was manufactured inthe United States, being called SCR-521 bytheArmy and ASE bytheNavy.
The SCR-521 operates atafrequent yof176 Me/see.
Two sets of antennas are provided giving different beam patterns (Fig.
6.29); one pattern isused forsearch and the other forhoming.
Each pattern con- sists ofaleftand aright lobe.
Inthesearch position these lobes extend broadside tothe airplane; inthe homing position they extend nearly straight ahead, sothat they overlap toaconsiderable extent.
The exact design ofthese antennas underwent acomplicated series ofchanges.
In some equipments separate antennas were used fortransmission and for reception, and inothers both functions were carried out with acommon antenna.
Inallcases, however, the general coverage and arrangement ofthebeams were those shown inFig.

This usually takes theform ofaprovision for“sector” scan and amodified indicator.
Sector scan is,asitsname implies, anarrangement forcausing theantenna toscan back and forth across adesired sector, sometimes one centered dead ahead ofthe aircraft, and sometimes one that isadjustable atthe will ofthe operator.
The indicator provisions forhoming areofeither oftwo types: thesetmay have atype Bdisplay, which facilitates homing because thecondition foraninterception course isthat the target signal approach down avertical line ofconstant azimuth, oritmay have an open-center PPI.
Inthelatter, thetarget follows along aradius asthe range isclosed onaninterception course; the open center reduces the crowding ofsignals atshort ranges and makes homing easier.
Amovable engraved marker orelectronic index showing constant azimuth isusually provided with either type ofdkplay toaidinhoming.

6.13] HOMING 201 application, since thetarget speed ismuch higher (and much more nearly that oftheintercepting aircraft), and since homing must becarried outin two dimensions instead ofone.
An early AIequipment was designed bytheBritish asanextension toAIofthe design principles ofASV Mark II.
Itwas designated AI lMark IVbythe British; asimilar system made forthe U.S.
Army byanAmerican manufacturer was called SCR-540.
Inthis set, which operated near 200 Me/see, asingle transmitting antenna sent abroad lobe inthe forw-ard direction from the aircraft.
Two pairs ofreceiving antennas were provided; one pair produced overlapping lobes like the “homing” lobes oftheASV Mark II,togive anindication (also identical with that ofthe ASV Mark II)ofthe homing error inazimuth.
The other pair oflobes was used tomeasure homing error inelevation angle; they overlapped exactly when viewed from above the airplane, but one was displaced slightly above thecenter line oftheairplane and theother slightly below the center line.
Elevation horning error was shown ona second indicator exactly like that ofthe ASV Mark II,turned through 90° sothat the range sweep occurred horizontally from left toright.
Signals from the upper lobe displaced the trace upward; those from the lower lobe displaced itdownward.
The receiver was rapidly switched toeach ofthefour receiving antennas inturn, and thedisplay correspond- ingyswitched totheproper deflection plate oftheappropriate indicator tube.
Range could beread either ontheazimuth tube orontheeleva- tion tube.
The arrangement ofthe receiving antenna patterns and of theindications isshown inFig.

The principal operational limitation ofthis equipment was aresult ofthefact that very broad beams were produced bythesingle-dipole-and- reflector antennas used.
These broad beams gave strong reflections from the ground beneath theaircraft, restricting the maximum range at which aircraft echoes could beseen toless than thealtitude atwhich the AI-equipped fighter was flying.
Inthe case ofASV operating on200 Me/see, similar returns from the seawere experienced, but the returns from ship targets were sostrong that signals were sought and tracked at ranges beyond the seareturn.
Aircraft echoes were many times weaker, sothat aircraft could beseen only atranges shorter than the ground return.
Itwas clear that thebest hope ofescaping thk limitation was tomake useofasharper beam inAIequipment, and since themaximum antenna size was limited bythe necessity ofaircraft installation, considerable effort was exerted todevelop amicrowave AI.

reflector which is housed inawing nacelle inthe same fashion asthat oftheAN/APS-3.
Asthis reflector isrotated at1200 rpm about anaxis passing through its feed and parallel tothe line offlight ofthe aircraft, the paraboloid is slowly tilted from aposition inwhich itsaxis coincides with the axis of rotation toaposition inwhich there isa60° angle between these axes.
Because ofthepattern thus traced outinspace bythebeam (Fig.

Two voltages, respectively linear with the azimuth error and with the elevation error inpointing the axis ofthe conical scan toward the target, are applied toaspot error indicator ofthe type described inSec.

The pilot completes the interception bykeeping the spot centered onhisscope, and closing the range until the wings of thespot have grown tothedesired size.

Precision Tracking ofaSingle Target.
-During thewar, con- siderable effort wx expended inthe design ofradar forhighly precise position-finding onone target atatime.
This tracking was ordinarily intended topermit the control offire against such atarget, but asthe war drew toaclose, itwas also used fordetailed control ofthemaneuvers ofthetarget byradio instructions from acontroller ataground station.
This was done topermit blind bombing byfight-bombers too small to carry aradar setand itsoperator, ortoenable anairc#t notequipped with radar tomake ablind landing approach oninstructions from acon- troller ataground radar.
The latter usehas, and will probably continue tohave, aconsiderable peacetime importance.
Lobe-sw”tching andPip-matching-The first radar setintended for precision tracking ofasingle target was theSCR-268, alaboratory proto- type ofwhich was formally demonstrated tothe Secretary ofWar in May 1937.
The problem ofaccurately tracking amoving target with an antenna that can beelevated and trained issimilar tothe problem of homing with the help of.fixed antennas onamovable vehicle, and the same techniques areuseful.
Lobe switching, which has been described inthelast Section, isemployed bytheSCR-268 forangle-error determi- nation; infact, the SCR-268 was the earliest production radar touse this technique.

Return echoes arereceived ontwo separate antenna arrays, each with its ownreceiver, Onearray, sixdlpoles ~videby four Mgh, @vesinformation toanazimuth scope; the other, two dipoles wide and sixhigh, provides signals toanelevation scope.
The receiving arrays have two separate feeds arranged toproduce different phase relations between theelements ofthe array.
Thus, byswitching theazimuth receiver from one feed to another, thebeam pattern ofthereceiving antenna can beswitched from one totheother oftwo overlapping lobes equally displaced inazimuth on opposite sides ofthe normal tothe antenna array.
Similar switching arrangements are provided forthe elevation antenna and itsreceiving channel.
The antennas are mounted onasingle cross arm, which rotates in azimuth with acentral pedestal enclosing the radar circuits and can be turned about itsown axis toelevate the arrays.
Three operators, each with ascope, ride with the cross arm asitturns.
Arange operator is provided with anA-scope having amovable marker which hekeeps on the signal being tracked.
His rotation ofthe range handwheel feeds range information toa“height converter,” acomputing mechanism employing athree-dimensional cam tocombine slant range and elevation angle insuch away that continuous target altitude information ispro- duced.
Rotation ofthe range handwheel also brings the signal being tracked into the center ofthe azimuth and elevation display tubes.
Each ofthese tubes ismanned byanoperator provided with ahandwheel which moves the antenna inthe appropriate angular coordinate.
The display istype K(Fig.
6“4).
Itisthe duty ofthe azimuth operator to keep the two signal ‘‘pips” inthecenter ofhisscope matched inheight byturning hishandwheel; theelevation operator has asimilar task.
The maximum design range ofthesetis40,000 yards, and therepeti- tion rate is4098 pps.
With apower output greater than 50kwand a pulse width of7to15psec, thesetisvery conservatively designed, and can track targets much beyond itsrated range.
Angular accuracies attainable inpractice with this equipment, about +1°,aretoo poor to permit good blind antiaircraft tfire, and because ofground reflections the equipment suffers from severe errors inreading elevation atangles smaller than about 10°.
However, this versatile, rugged, and readily mobile equipment was available inquantity early inthe war, and served many useful roles, being used forfirecontrol, short-range search and warning, and searchlight control.
Conical ScanandErrorIndication.—In asituation where notmore than one target atatime isexpected intheradar field ofview, theequipment necessary totrack atarget can beconsiderably simplified.
Such acase 206THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA [SEC.614 arose inthepast war inconnection with the defense ofbombing aircraft against nightfighters.
The limitations ofAIradar were such that a coordinated attack onasingle bomber bymore than one nightfighter was notpossible, and theonly practicable attack was thestern chase.
Under I these circumstances, the bomber can beprotected byasimple, short- range radar equipment mounted inthe tail turret.
The B-29 was equipped with aradar ofthis sort, theAN/APG-15.

614] PRECISION TRACKING OF ASINGLE TARGET 207 ingcoverage ofthe tail cone without the necessity forscanning.
The beam \vas conically scanned byrotating thereflector about anaxis which made anangle of2.5° ~rith itso~rn.
Commutators were mounted onthe shaft ofthe antenna rotation mechanism sothat signals from the upper half ofthe scan collld beintegrated and compared with those from the lower half; similarly, signals from theleft half ofthescan were compared with those from the right.
The resulting error voltages were used to deflect thespot ofaCRT used asanerror indicator.
Anautomatic cir- cuit searched inrange inthe absence ofatarget, and locked onand tracked atarget when anecho was encountered within the 2000-yd coverage ofthe set.
This range circuit was used tobrighten the spot only when atarget was inrange, inorder todistinguish between correct pointing and the absence ofatarget.
Italso caused the target spot to grow horizontal “wings” whose spread increased asthe range grew shorter, inorder toprovide anindication ofrange tothe gunner (see Fig.
6.13).
The axis ofthe conical scan was aligned with the guns sothat only point-blank fire with nolead was possible.
Thk was done because the lead required incountering theusual nightfighter approach isnegligible.
“ The indicator was soarranged that itsdisplay was projected into the reflector sight, enabling the gunner tousethe same technique foreither optical orradar tracking.
This equipment became available solate in the war that ithad substantially nooperational use, but itsproving- ground tests indicated that itsperformance would have been quite satis- factory.
The attainable angular accuracy was about +0.5°.
The AN/APG-15 was unusual inthat atriode, the “lighthouse” tube, was used asapulsed oscillator.
Atthelow pulse power used (about 500 watts), this enabled transmitter, receiver, and thenecessary rectifier- filter power supplies tobehoused inone compact unit, shown inFig.
6.36.
Automatic AngleTracking.
-Shortcomings ofthe SCR-268 asafire- control position finder arose mainly from the use ofarelatively long wavelength which resulted inbroad beams from antennas ofany reason- able size.
When microwave radar became practicable with the develop- ment ofthe cavity magnetron, one ofthe immediate applications ofthe new technique was anantiaircraft position finder.
The most widely used and generally successfld ofthe resulting equipments was theSCR-584.
Before beginning precision tracking ofasingle target, aradar that is toserve asthe only equipment ofanantiaircraft battery must execute a general search inorder tolocate targets that are tobetracked and engaged.
Noauxiliarv long-wave radar search equipment was provided \vith the SCR-584.
Instead, the 6-ft antenna reflector was helically scanned, and targets presented onaPPI whose maximum range was 60,000 yd.
Arange ofelevation angles upto10° was covered bythe 208 THEGATHERING ANDPRESENTATION OFRADAR DATA [~EC.
614 helical scan.
Alternatively, theantenna could besettorotate uniformly inazimuth, theelevation being manually controlled, orboth azimuth and elevation could bemanually controlled.
The performance at10-cm wavelength was more than adequate togive the 60,000-yd range desired onsingle aircraft, and the convenience ofhaving acommon radar per- form both the search and the tracking functions isvery great.

Precision Tracking During Rapid Scan.2—.At the end ofSec.
6.12 weconsidered thedesign ofsystems forgeneral airsurveillance and control which offered fairly accurate information, renewed ever,y few seconds, onallthe positional coordinates ofalltargets inthe radar field ofview.
This was claimed tobetheoperational ideal; and soitis,fora radar setwhose purpose istopermit thegeneral control ofaircraft.
For firecontrol, orfortheclose control ofaircraft which isneeded ifaground controller istocoach apilot through ablind landing approach, much more precise and much more nearly continuous positional information than that supplied bytheV-beam isdemanded.
The requirement ofgreater precision implies that narrower radar beams must beused, and the requirement ofmore frequent information implies anincrease inthe speed ofscanning.
These design changes, as wehave seen, seriously restrict thevolume ofspace which can becovered bytheresulting radar set.
However, thegoal ofmaintaining atleast a partial situation picture byscanning, while simultaneously providing highly accurate positional information onaparticular target being tracked, issoattractive that several equipments have been designed to attain it.
The requirement ofhigh scanning speed has ledthedesigners ofallsuch sets touse “electrical” scanners (Chap.
9).
The design limitation onthe volume ofspace that can becovered frequently enough tobeuseful isleast troublesome inthecase ofaradar equipment designed todeal ~rith surface targets.
Inthis case, one is interested only incoverage ofaplane, not insearching the volume of space that may contain aircraft.
The most advanced equipment ofthe rapid-scan precision-tracking type that was infield use atthe end of World War IIwas the AN’/TPG-l, which had been designed forthe control ofshore-battery fireagainst ships.

The Signal and ItsUse.—The presentation ofecho signals onan indicator bynomeans completes theproblem ofdesigning anoperation- ally useful radar system.
Itisnecessary that action ofsome sort be taken onthebasis oftheinformation afforded bytheradar.
Toenable this action tobetaken promptly, intelligently, and correctly, anorganiza- tion must becreated.
This organization begins with theradar indication and extends tothe execution ofcommands that arise from thesitua- tion asdisplayed bytheradar.
The nature ofthese commands and the nature ofthe organization that assimilates theradar data and gives the commands differ widely from one functional use ofradar toanother.
The organization that employs radar data may bealmost entirely mechanized and automatic, asis,forexample, theArmy system forradar antiaircraft fire control.
Inthis system, the azimuth, elevation, and range ofatarget are transmitted directly and continuously from the radar toanelectrical computer.
The computer solves the fire-control problem, determines the future position ofthe target, and transmits azimuth, elevation, and range (fuze time) information tothe guns ofthe battery.
The guns are positioned automatically bymeans ofservo- mechanisms, and afuze-setting mechanism isautomatically adjusted to cutfuzes tothetime-setting indicated bythe computer.
zThe duties of the gun crew arethe purely mechanical ones ofsupplying ammunition and loading.
The Army system ofantiaircraft fire control just sketched was out- standingly successful inthe past war.
This success can beviewed as demonstrating the principle that, when acomplicated task must be carried out quickly and accurately under trying conditions, extreme mechanization iswell worth while, ifitremoves from human operators the necessity foremploying judgment and forperforming complicated operations.
Such mechanization substitutes fortheskill ofoperators the design, manufacturing, and maintenance skills that are necessary to 1Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.7, and7.8byL.N.Ridenour, Sec.

The advantage ofmaking this substitution istwo-fold: the latter skills can beapplied under favorable conditions, while operator skill isrequired in the field onthe occasion ofeach crisis; further, there areusually many more operators ofagiven equipment than there aredesigners, production engineers, and maintenance men, combined.
The total skill required is thus more economically used under more favorable conditions ifmech- anization isemployed.
Most problems involving radar arefarsimpler than that ofantiair- craft firecontrol.
Asimple setmay beused onaship, forexample, for navigation and collision avoidance.
Under these circumstances, allthat isrequired isagood PPI display onthe bridge, and perhaps analarm that gives asignal ifaradar target approaches within amile.
Very good navigation can beperformed bycomparing the PPI with achart and taking therange and bearing ofsufficient identifiable points shown onthe radar todetermine the location oftheship.
The organization required beyond the radar indicator consists inthis case ofvery little more than theship’s navigator.
The problem ofcreating themost efficient organization fortheuseof radar data, ineach functional situation involving radar, isavery com- plicated one.
During the war, itlacked the systematic study that its importance and itscomplexity deserved.
Since any treat ment ofsystem design would beincomplete without some reference tothis important topic, this chapter will deal briefly with some ofthe devices and some of themethods which have been worked outtotranslate into commands the decisions taken onthebasis ofradar information.
1 Itistobeemphasized that this subject isatleast asdifficult and as important asthat ofthetechnical design ofthe radar itself, and farless well understood.
We can now build reliable radar equipment whose principal performance limitation arises because the earth isround; the major improvements tobelooked forinthe use ofradar over the next few years will lie,forthemost part, notinthecategory oftechnical radar design, but inthe field offitting the entire radar system, including its operational organization, tothe detailed needs oftheuse and theuser.

The indicator screen isviewed through aninclined, partially reflecting piece ofglass which reflects tothe eye ofthe observer theimage ofascreen onwhich achart isprojected.
Special coatings for glass have been developed which give ahigh reflectivity intheblue region ofthespectrum, while transmitting yellow light substantially without loss.
Ifsuch acoating isused ontheinclined mirror, the yellow persistent signals onthe PPI tube can beseen with nearly their full intensity, while thechart image can beprojected onthe mirror inblue, sothat itisreflected with little loss inintensity.

They are com- plicated, bulky, and expensive, and thefunction they perform can rather simply bedone byother means.
Dead-reckoning Computers.—The direct comparison ofthe PPI with anappropriate chart isanunnecessary elegance ifitisdesired merely to take occasional fixes and toproceed between fixes bytheusual methods ofdead reckoning.
This is,inany event, theonly safe means ofnaviga- tion.
When the first microwave PPI radar was installed inaircraft, careless navigators neglected their dead reckoning inthe belief that the radar would enable them todetermine their position whenever necessary.
This procedure resulted ingetting lost with such regularity that radar was soon established asanadjunct todead reckoning, rather than asub- stitute forit.
Toassist indead reckoning, particularly inaircraft navigation where high speed and frequent course changes make itdifficult, various forms 216 THE EMPLOYMENT OF RADAR DATA [SEC.
7.2 ofdead-reckoning computers, orodographs, have been developed.
The control box ofone such computer isshown inFig.
72.
This device, developed intheDivision 17program oftheNDRC, receives information from atrue-airspeed meter and arepeater compass.
These data are resolved into cartesian velocity components along the north-south and east-west directions, and these velocity values areintegrated toprovide continuous readings ofairposition with reference toany chosen point of departure.
Amechanism isalsoprovided toindicate ground position bytaking account oftheeffect ofwind.
The direction and speed ofthe wind (as determined from double drift readings, meteorological information, com- parison ofearlier wind settings with the actual course made good, radar fixes, orotherwise) can besetinto the device bymeans ofknobs shown 1.

Airposition and actual ground position both appear on the counter dials shown atthe lower left.
The output signals ofthe unit can also beused toactuate aplotting arm which moves over amap table not shown inFig.

With this addition, the de- vice draws onamap the actual ground track made good bythe aircraft carrying theinstrument.
Vari- ousmap scales can beselected fortheplotting table bymeans ofaknob onthe control box.
The control box can also beprovided with agear train that actuates amechanism showing latitude and longitude directly, inaddition toshowing the departure from thelast fix.
Inacarefully made installation, the cumulative error ofthis instrument amounts to only ~percent ofthetotal distance traveled from thepoint ofdeparture.
Ground-position Indicator, GPI.—Although the device just described aids inperforming dead reckoning, and tothis extent assists inradar navigation, itisconvenient topresent the results ofthe dead reckoning directly onthe radar scope.
This has been done inadevice called the “Ground-position Indicator,” orGPI.
The GPI provides anelectronic index forthe PPI tube ofthe radar intheform oftheintersection ofacircle ofconstant range and anazimuth SEC.

Once this index has been setonaradar echo bymeans of adjusting knobs provided onthe device, the index will move across the face ofthe tube with theecho, provided that the wind setting has been made properly, regardless ofmaneuvers oftheaircraft.
Asimplified schematic diagram ofthe GPI isshown inFig.

To the left ofthe box marked “Rectangular topolar coordinate resolv w,” thedevice isidentical with the dead-reckoning computer just described.

When thetwo areequal, anazimuth mark isput ontheradar indicator electronically.
The range information provided bythe resolver ismeasured hori- zontally along the ground; itmust becorrected forthe altitude ofthe aircraft if,asisusual, slant range isdisplayed by.the radar indicator.
This isdone bymeans oftheelectrical triangle-solver labeled ‘‘Slant range circuit, “into which thevalue ofaircraft altitude issetbythe operator.
The value ofslant range computed bythis device isused toput arange marker onthe PPI atthe appropriate distance from the origin ofthe sweep.
Taking afixwith theGPI involves turning theIi-S and E-W fixknobs until theintersection oftherange and azimuth marks appears ontop of anidentified target signal.
The “fix” dials will then read the ground range ofthetarget from theaircraft, resolved into north-south and east- west components.
Asthe aircraft moves, these dials will continue to read the correct position ofthe target relative tothe aircraft and the 218 THEEMPLOYMENT OFRADARDATA [SEC.
73 index will continue tostay onthetarget echo, provided that the correct value ofwind has been setinto thedevice bymeans ofthetwo “wind” knobs shown.
Even after theindex and thetarget echo have moved off theface oftheradar indicator, thedials will still show thetarget position relative totheaircraft.
The determination ofwind requires that two fixoperations like that just described bemade onthesame echo (which need notcorrespond toa target whose identity isknown).
The major correction which will have tobemade atthesecond fixisthat arising from theeffect ofwind.
The wind and fixknobs ofthe GPI arearranged sothat they can begripped together and turned together bythe same amount.
Aproper choice of scale factors will enable the operation oftaking thesecond fixtocorrect thewind velocity atthesame time.

Another, which seems obvious but presents con- siderable tethnical difficulty, isthat ofdirect optical projection ofan enlarged real image ofthedisplay onanappropriate screen.
The light intensity from apersistent cathode-ray-tube screen ofthe usual type istoolow forsatisfactory enlarged projection.
Several alter- native methods ofaccomplishing the same result have been used or proposed, including: 1.Splitting the cascade screen (Sec.

Although this scheme isbetter than direct projection ofacascade screen, results are farfrom satisfactory. 220 2.

TheSkiatron.—The dark-trace tube, described briefly inSec.

InEngland, anextremely flat-faced tube serves asthe source forawide-aperture lens system; inthis country atube has been designed tofitaSchmidt optical system.
Figure 7.6illustrates the latter.

Between 10and 12kv isapplied tothefinal anode ofthetube.
Signals appear asmagenta-colored patches against awhite back- ground, and they canbeviewed inthepresence ofareasonably high level ofambient light.
This property, together with the large, flat, parallax- free image, makes the display extremely useful for measurement and plotting.
However, ithas serious inadequacies which arise from short- comings ofthe skiatron tube.
Contrast isalways low, particularly at low duty ratios.
Repeated signals have avery objectionable tendency to“burn in,” becoming stronger than transient signals and remaining on thetube long ,after theradar echo that created them has moved away or disappeared.
This difficulty can beconsiderably alleviated byocca- sionally raising thetube temperature and scanning thescreen with aweak electron beam, both ofwhich measures tend tobleach the screen.
A fairly intense burned-in pattern can thus beremoved inone ortwo minutes.
Initspresent technical state, theskiatron ismost useful forobserving and plotting the courses ofships, from either ashipboard oracoastal station.
Itisless satisfactory when used todisplay aircraft signals, because ofthepoor contrast intheir more rapidly moving echoes.

Bythis term is meant the addition totheradar signals ofsignals which, byappropriate intensity-modulation ofthe indicator, reproduce onthe display itself a map, agrid, orany pattern that may bedesired.
The position ofradar echo signals can becompared with this electronic map with complete freedom from parallax, and, inaddition, any distortions orimperfections ofthedisplay affect thegrid and thesignals equally and thus produce no reading error.
Avery satisfactory method ofaccomplishing this has been given thename of“video mapping.
” The signals required toproduce the desired modulation are derived from thedevice illustrated inFig.
7.8.
The desired map, intheform of opaque lines on atransparent background orvice versa, isplaced immediately infront ofanauxil- iary PPI ofthe highest precision obtainable.
This PPI rotates in synchronism with the radar an- tenna and executes itsrange sweep mthe proper time relation with theradar transmitter, butoperate? ataconstant intensity, receiving novideo signals.

The Relay ofRadar Displays.—It iscommon forthebest location ofthe radar station and the optimum location ofacontrol center tobe different.
The radar siteischosen from thestandpoint ofgood coverage, freedom flompermanent echoes, and the like; the criteria entering into thechoice ofsite foracontrol center areusually entirely different.
Also, acontrol center should receive supplementary information from other radar installations located elsewhere, even though asingle radar equip- ment may provide theprimary data forcontrol ofoperations.
This will enable thecoverage oftheprimary radar tobesupplemented byinforma- tion from neighboring sectors, and will provide coverage ofpossible “blind spots” oftheprimary radar.
The telling ofplots bytelephone land line was thetechnique first used (Sec.
7.5) forthe transmission ofradar data from one point toanother.
Substantial errors and delays areinherent inthis procedure.
Far more important, when the information tobetransmitted has been @hered byamodern long-range, high-definition radar, isthelow traffic-handling capacity ofthe system oftelling and plotting.
Literally hundreds of targets may show atagiven time ontheindicator ofsuch aradar asthe first one described inChap.

Considerations such asthese ledtothe development ofmeans for reproducing radar displays atadistant point bytransmitting the radar video signals and appropriate synchronizing information bymore orless conventional radio practice.

The systems described are, forthemost part, necessarily those setupinwar- time forthe purposes ofwar, and tothis extent donot represent useful models forpeacetime radar organizations.
Itwill, however, beinstruc- tive toconsider briefly afew typical systems.
7.6.
Radar inthe RAF Fighter Command .-Just asthe first radar equipment tobeused inoperations was that installed fortheairdefense oftheBritish Isles, sothe first operating radar organization was that of RAF Fighter Command, theuser ofthis equipment.
When the organi- zation was fully developed, the number ofpeople in?olved inthe inter- pretation oftheradar information and inmaking useofitwas comparable tothenumber required toobtain it.
Organization oftheHome Chain.—It has been mentioned inSec.
6..9 that theperformance ofCH stations depended very much onthenature oftheir sites.
Moreover, owing toashortage oftrained men and tothe difficulties involved inmaintaining equipment ofthis kind inwartime, the antenna systems were often badly installed and inadequately main- tained.
Inconsequence, large errors inapparent azimuth were very common; most stations had errors of10°or15°, and errors aslarge as30° were not unknown.
The method ofmeasuring height depended on reflection ofthe received waves from the ground, and almost invariably theheight calibration ofastation was different along different azimuths.
Each station had tobechecked and calibrated both forheight and azi- muth byanelaborate and difficult series oftest flights.
The complicated nature ofthe corrections necessary oneach aircraft plot, and therequirement forspeed and accuracy inapplying these cor- rections, ledthe British todesign and install what isperhaps the first device intended forassistance intheuseofradar data, asopposed tothe gathering and display ofthat data.
This isthe celebrated “fruit machine, ”lacomplicated calculating machine made upofstandard telephone selector switches and relays.
The operator measured the range ofthetarget bysetting amarker totheecho onthe.4-scope.
She then turned the goniometer until the echo disappeared, and pressed buttons transmitting range and apparent azimuth tothe fruit machine.
The machine automatically applied the appropriate correction and deduced the true azimuth, multiplied the target range bythe sine and thecosine ofthis true azimuth, added intherectangular map coordinates ofthe station itself, and deduced the coordinates ofthe target.
This :Itwasnamed after theEnglish equivalent oftheAmerican slotmachine used for gambling. SEC.
7.51 RADAR IN THE RAF FIGHTER COMMAND 227 information was displayed inlights toa“teller,” who passed theinfor- mation over atelephone line toFighter Command Headquarters.
Ata later stage, the plots were passed byteletype tosave time.
The whole computation process was completed inasecond orso.
The operator then pressed abutton which connec Ledthegoniometer totheheight-finding antenna arrays.
Again sheturned the goniometer until the signal disappeared, and pressed abutton.
The height ofthe target was computed bythefruit machine and passed toheadquarters.
Radar plots from allofthechain stations were sent toFighter ~om- mand inStanmore, north ofI,ondon.
Because oftheshortcomings ofthe early radar equipment, and the “blind spots” inthe coverage ofindi- vidual sets! itwas felt tobeessential tocombine the information from allradar stations atacentral point.
This was done ataso-called “filter center.
” Inalarge underground bombproof room was mounted acentral table whose surface was agridded map ofEngland.
Acrew ofplotters, each with atelephone connection toone ofthe radar stations, stood around thetable atpositions corresponding tothegeographical locations ofthe Chain stations.
Asaplotter received plots over the telephone, sheput colored disk markers inthegrid positions indicated.
Itusually happened that two mmore stations were simultaneously plotting the same aircraft, sothat several girls might beputting down counters repre- senting thesame formation.
Owing totheerrors inthesystem and the variable delays intheplotting process, theinterpretation ofthe piles of disks interms ofaircraft was noteasy.
Special officers known asfilterers stood beside the girls and decided, forexample, whether two adjscent tracks were really separate, orrepresented thesame aircraft, erroneously plotted byone ofthe stations.
After hehad analyzed the data, the filterer put onthemap alittle plaque that bore hisbest estimate ofthe identity, position, height, speed, and number ofaircraft intheformation.
This whole process was observed byfilter ofice~s who satonabalcony overlooking the map.
They were informed ofthe plans forthe move- ments offriendly aircraft.
They were able todirect theoperations ofthe whole Chain and todecide which formations should beplotted byeach station.
The work ofthe filter officer called foraconsiderable under- standing ofthe performance ofCH stations, and anappreciation ofthe good and bad qualities ofeach individual installation.
Established tracks onthe filter-room board were telephoned bya teller toasecond plotting board maintained inan‘‘operations room.
” Here thefiltered radar tracks were combined with plots oftheObserver Corps (visual airplane spotters), and with fixes made bymeans ofradio direction finders, Inthis main control room, theaim was todisplay the whole ofthepicture oftheair\var; alloperations were generally directed 228 THEEMPLOYMENT OFRADAR DA1’.4 [SEC.
75 from this point.
The detailed control offighter interceptors was carried out from group and sector headquarters, where plots were maintained on thebasis ofinformation repeated from Fighter Command Headquarters.
The operation ofthis system was much more difficult than might be inferred from this brief description.
IftheCH stations had been perfect, itwould still have been difficult tointerpret some hundreds ofplots every minute, allsubject tovariable delays and tothe personal errors ofthe observers.
Quite trivial difficulties proved surprisingly hard toover- come.
Itwas hard tofind room forallthe plotters around the table.
They could not plot fast enough.
They might disturb one setofplots when they leaned over toplot another aircraft.
Such rather simple difficulties could be,and often were, the limiting factors ontheuse that could bemade oftheradar plots, and anintensive study ofallthestages inplotting and filtering was made throughout the early years ofthe war.
Despite thelarge number ofpeople necessary tothis system, and its prodigal useoftelephone land lines forthetelling ofplots, itsoperational limitations were severe.
Under conditions ofmoderate aircraft density, agood filter officer with agood organization could filter plots with an accuracy ofperhaps 70percent.
When plots were sparse, the accuracy was excellent, and the on]yobjection tothe system was itsunavoidable time lag inreporting.
Under conditions ofhigh aircraft density, the system broke down, and itwas commonplace tocease reporting incertain areas where thedensity was sohigh that filtering was impossible.
Inspite ofthese handicaps, very considerable success attended the use ofthis system inthe Battle ofBritain and thereafter.
Atendency grew toforget that themain reason fororganizing thereporting and con- trol system inthis centralized way was that asingle radar could not be relied ontogive asufficiently complete oraccurate picture ofevents inthe air.
The great technical improvements of1943 and early 1944 resulted inlong-range, high-definition microwave radar having good coverage ifproper] ysited.
This improved equipment made itpossible todepend onasingle radar installation for asubstantially complete picture oftheairsituation.
Delays and errors unavoidable inacomplicated scheme oftelling and plotting arelargely eliminated inasystem that combines theoperational organization with the radar equipment.
Controllers who give instruc- tions toaircraft are able towork directly from the radar display and therefore have afarmore accurate and up-to-date appreciation ofthe situation than can beobtained from aplot, however well maintained it may be.
This was eventually appreciated, and such systems have been put into very successful operation.

Inaddition, they executed direct control ofairborne fighters oncertain types of missions.
Let usconsider first the reporting function oftheFDP, leaving until later theconsideration ofcontrol directly from theFDP.
The following steps must occur before radar information isintheform inwhich itwas used fordecision and action: 1.The coordinates ofatarget signal areread offthe display atthe radar station.

The other two FDP’s had British long-wave equipment.
The longer range ofthe microwave radar shows inthelonger track duration fortheFDP equipped with that set.
Differences inthetotal number oftracks reported arwe from adiffer- ingdensity ofairtraffic indifferent areas, and from thefact that thefrac- tion oftime spent offtheairformaintenance and other reasons differed from one FDP toanother.
Alltheplots observed attheFDP arenot passed totheFCC.
Since control executed bytheFDP makes sector control bytheFCC outdated formany operations, itisunimportant toreport allplots.
Astudy made atone oftheFDP’s of.X1X TAC from Sept.

21,1944, aperiod d]lring which airactivity was limited bybad flying weather, showed that 232 THEEMPLOYMENT OFRADARDATA [SEC.
7.6 50percent ofthetotal plots obtained were passed on.
However, 84per cent ofthe tracks were reported, the difference being due tosingle-plot tracks which were not reported.
The average number ofplots pertrack was 6.2and theaverage track duration 9.5min.
Hence, ontheaverage, aplot was obtabed oneach track once every 1.8rnin, which isconsidered tobefairly continuous tracking.
Close Control bytheFDP.—At the turn ofthe year 194041, the Luftwaffe abandoned itsdaytime attacks onEngland and turned tonight bombing, the attacking aircraft operating individually.
This ledto~he development bytheBritish ofanelaborate system ofnightfighter defense which hasbeen described elsewhere.
1One ofthefeatures ofthis system was exact control ofthenightfighter, prior tohisinterception ofthehostile bomber, byaground controller ataGCI (for Ground-controlled Inter- ception) radar station.
The aim ofthis control was toput the night- fighter behind, alittle below, and onthe same course asthe hostile aircraft, inwhich position hewas well situated tocomplete the inter- ception ~vith thehelp ofairborne radar equipment hehimself carried.
By1943, both this GCI technique, involving precise control ofsingle aircraft byacontroller located ataradar station, and thedaytime sector- control technique described inSec.
7.5, involving thecontrol offormations offighter interceptors from acentral station atwhich radar data were assembled and assessed, were firmly established procedures.
Inthat year two things happened which gave rise tothetechnique ofclose con- trol asitwas practiced bythe FDp’s ofthe -herican TAC’S inthe continental phase oftheIluropean war.
Ayoung .Imerican officer, lyho was \vorking with the R.\F asamember ofthe Electronics Training Group sent totheunited I1ingdom soon after the~nited States went to war, conceived theidea ofcontrolling formations ofday fighters directly from the information available athisradar station alone.
lleanf~-bile battleexperience inilfrica shom-ed that anindependent radar setcould pass toairborne fighters useful information onthe disposition ofenemy aircraft.
The American officer’s novel idea didnot gain immediate acceptance since control ofseveral squadrons offighters indaylight requires tech- niques quite different from those ofthe GCI control ofasingle night- fighter.
Finally, the officer ~f-as giiren permission bythe late .Iir C7hief IIarshal SirTrafford Leigh-lIallory tocontrol wings offighters directly from his radar station, entirely independently ofthe sector-control system.

This equipment, designed foraccurate tracking ofasingle aircraft atatime, inorder topermit antiaircraft fire control, can also beused toprovide toaground controller theinformation necessary forhighly precise control oftheaircraft being tracked.
Itwas soused bytheTAC’S inEurope.
Since the information ontarget position isnormally transmitted to the antiaircraft computer bymeans ofsynchros oraccurate potentiom- eters (Sec.

This was first done bymeans ofthe 180° plotting board shown inusein Fig.

Range information from the setisused to control the position ofarange carriage that runs inand out along the azimuth arm.
The carriage hasanoptical system which projects asmall spot oflight upthrough theglass surface oftheplotting board.
Over the surface oftheplotting board isstretched amap ofthe area surrounding theradar set, carefully adjusted sothat thepoint onthemap occupied by theradar isdirectly above thepivot ofthemoving arm.
The scale factor oftherange-carriage mechanism isadjusted tocorrespond \vith thescale ofthe map being used, which may beeither 1to50,000 or1to100,000.
When theradar istracking atarget, thespot oflight from therange car- riage shows uponthe map just atthe position over which the airplane isflying atthat moment.
The controller can thus issue hkinstructions with full and constant knowledge oftheexact position oftheaircraft under hiscontrol.
This is tobecontrasted with thesituation that obtains inground control from a scanning radar; inthat case the controller has only one “look” athis target per scan—that is,perhaps once in15sec.
However, hesees all other targets intheairwithin range ofhisradar.
The controller inthe SCR-584 sees the position ofhisaircraft continuously, and inproper relation totheterrain, but theprice paid forthis isthat hehasnoknowl- edge ofthewhereabouts ofother aircraft. SEC.

Itplots inrectangular rather than inpolar coordinates, contains “smoothing” circuits that greatly improve the accuracy oftheplotted aircraft position, and draws anink record ofthe position ofthe aircraft being tracked, sothat the controller has aknowledge ofthe aircraft course, aswell asposition, at alltimes.
Thk device also plots inground range rather than inslant range.
The range atwhich aircraft can betracked bythe SCR-584 can be greatly increased, and theaccuracy oftracking somewhat improved, ifan airborne beacon (Chap.

The operational use made ofthe SCR-584 asmodified foraircraft control was basically any that required precise navigation under restricted visibility.

Teleran.—The examples ofoperational radar systems will be closed with abrief account ofasystem still inthe developmental stage.
Itiscalled “Teleran” (for Television Radar Air Navigation) and involves the coordinated useofairand ground equipment.
The basic idea ofTeleran isthat high-performance ground radar, if supplemented by simple and reliable height-finding means and by SEC.
78] TELERAN 241 weather and route information, can provide allofthe data needed by aircraft foren-route navigation and forairport approach.
Further, high- precision ground radar cansupply alltheinformation that apilot requires, inaddition tohisown flight instruments, forinstrument approach and landing.
Allthat isrequired istogetthis information into the aircraft, where itcan bedisplayed toand used bythe pilot.
Itisproposed toadd tothe display ofaground radar achart that contains map, airways, and weather information ofinterest topilots, and tosend theresulting picture bytelevision totheaircraft, where itisdis- played tothe pilot.
Televising ofthe display ispreferred tothe use of the radar-relay methods described inChap.
17because television does not require the use ofpersistent phosphors, with their low maximum level oflight intensity, intheaircraft cockpit, where thelevel ofambient light islikely tobehigh.
Onthebasis oftheassumption that display ofallaircraft inthe pic- ture offered apilot would beuseless and confusing, itisproposed to separate the radar signals according tothe altitude atwhich the corre- sponding aircraft areflying.
Thus, forexample, apilot at5000 ftwould besent signals sho~}-ing the positions ofallaircraft inhisneighborhood and inthealtitude range from 3500 to6000 ft.
This canbeaccomplished technically bysupplying each plane with atransponder beacon ~~rhose reply signal iscoded (Sec.
8.8) inaccordance with the altitude atwhich the plane isflying.
This coding can becontrolled automa~ically byan altimeter.
Atthe ground radar station, signals inthevarious altitude intervals can besorted outand displayed separately fortransmission to aircraft using the system.
The transponder also increases therange of the radar equipment and, ifareply frequency different from thetrans- mitter frequency ofthe radar isused, eliminates difficulty from ground echoes which might interfere with seeing low-flying aircraft.
Figure 7.18 ~holl-s aTeleran display asitmight appear toapilot flying at11,000 ft.

These lines areshown dashed inFig.

Itisessential forthepilot toknow which ofthebeacon responses is that ofhisown plane.
This isaccomplished byhaving arotating radial line, centered atthe radar station (which appears inthe center ofthe picture), form part ofthe display information transmitted from the ground station, This line isnormally invisible, butthetelevision receiver iscontrolled byasignal from thetransponder insuch away that theline 242 THE EMPLOYMENT OF RADAR DATA [SEC.

CHAPTER 8 RADAR BEACONS BY L.A.TURNER Introduction.
—Radar wavesarereflected bytargets ofdifferent sizes regardless oftheir importance totheuser ofaradar set.
The echo from anaircraft may belost inmuch larger echoes from near-by mountains, or itmay become tooweak tobefollowed toranges asgreat asdesired.
The echo from afriendly aircraft islike that from ahostile one.
The exact location ofaplace onthe ground may beofimportance toaradar- equipped aircraft even though there isnodistinguishable radar target atthat point.
Innearly allcases where itwould beadvantageous ifan echo could bemade much stronger ormore readily distinguishable from other confusing ones, theuseofaradar beacon isindicated.
(An enemy aircraft obviously constitutes one difficult exception.
) The usefulness ofbeacons was demonstrated with theearly radar sets that were operated atlong wavelengths.
Alarge proportion ofthe beacons used inthe war operated atfrequencies about 200 Me/see.
These included the beacons used with ASV Mark IIsearch radar, the transponders used foridentification, the portable Eureka beacons that were part ofthe independent Rebecca-Eureka beacon system, and a much-used system for precise bombing, the Oboe Mark I.Another system forprecise bombing, the Gee-H system, used beacons ofeven lower frequency.
Inthis chapter, more emphasis isputonthenewer bea- cons athigher frequencies since thetrend inradar istoward microwaves.
The beacon isessentially arepeater ofradar pulses.
Ithas an antenna and receiver that convert pulses ofenergy, received athigh frequency from aradar setorspecial interrogator, into triggering signals.
Each such signal triggers thetransmitter inthe beacon and causes itto radiate one ormore pulses cfradio energy that may have almost any desired power, frequency, duration, number, and characteristic spacing.
Figure 8.1gives ablock diagram ofabeacon.
Since ittakes time forthe beacon toreact, thefirst reply pulse comes back totheradar setslightly delayed and indicates arange slightly greater than the true one.
In man yapplications this delay isnegligible, inothers itismade tohave a constant known value forwhich allowance can bemade.
The delay can bekept down toafew tenths ofamicrosecond when necessary.
Inthe special case where the radiated pulse issingle, has approximately the 243 244 RADAR BEACONS [SEC.
8 duration and frequency oftheradar pulse, and isnotappreciably delayed, the beacon acts somewhat like anecho amplifier.
The intensities of received and transmitted signals are, tobesure, independent, rather than infixed proportion asinthecase ofatrue amplifier.
Ingeneral, however, the frequency ofthe reply will bedifferent from that ofthe triggering radar set.
Inorder toreceive such replies, one needs areceiver tuned to thefrequency ofthepulses sent out bythe beacon instead oftothefre- quency oftheinitial transmitted pulses.
This may beeither thereceiver ofthe radar settuned tothe new frequency, orasecond independent receiver tuned tothebeacon.
Ineither case, thereeeiver ofthebeacon signals does notreceive radar echoes since itisnottuned forthem.
Thus, Receiving Transmitting antenna JLJantenna )b Transmitter +-Modulator Coder 7( or simple triqer Recewer +Decoder (optional) FIG.S.I.—Block diagram ofabeacon.
the beacon signals are separated from radar reflections and can bedis- played without being swamped byheavy permanent echoes.
Also, since the pulse power ofthe beacon transmitter can bemade asgreat as desired, there isnolimit tothe strength ofthe reply.
The range is limited only bythepower oftheradar transmitter and the sensitivity of thebeacon receiver, which determine whether the beacon transmitter is triggered ornot.
Figure 82a shows the radar echoes and Fig.

The pictures were taken one immediately after theother onthesame flight.
Byitsvery nature, theradar-beacon combination involves two send- receive links asdoes any two-way communication system.
The two links areordinarily connected automatically inasimple regular way and are uninfluenced byhuman reactions.
Since the channels exist, how- ever, they afford the basis foracommunications system.

8.1 beacons have sometimes been used inproviding communication systems ofamdimentary sort andalso forexercising remote control.
Intelligence has been conveyed from theradar toabeacon-carrying vehicle bymodi- fication ofthe repetition rate, the length ofinterrogating pulses, their spacing ingroups, ortheduration oftheintervals ofinterrogation.
The replies ofthe beacons have also been modulated insuch ways.
One 200-M c/sec beacon was used fortwo-way voice communication while still functioning foritsnormal use.
For themost part, however, this usefor communications has been somewhat incidental.
Much fuller use ofthe channels could bemade since the portion ofthe spectrum required for transmission ofbeacon signals ofasimple sort isample forconveying much more complicated intelligence.
Beacons ofthe synchronous sort just described have been variously called “radar beacons,” ‘~responder beacons,” “racons,” and “trans- ponders,’’ there being noessential distinctions among these terms.
The discussion hereis confinedto such beacons since other free-running types, more like ordinary radio beacons, appear tobeless useful inconjunction with radar sets.
From the free-running type, only the bearing can be determined.
Radar information isparticularly useful because itgives accurate determinations ofrange; itisobviously sensible toprovide, as anadjunct toradar, the sort ofbeacon that makes the best use ofthis property.

Types ofRadar-beacon Systems.—In adiscussion ofbeacons itisconvenient toclassify them asfixed ground beacons, shipborne beacons, airborne beacons, and portable beacons.
Allofthese may be used inconjunction with ground, ship, orairborne radar sets, orwith spe- cial interrogator-responsors.
The following combinations have proved useful sofar: Ground Radar, 1.Shipbome beacons.

This combination has proved tobeofgreat usefulness foridentification and forvarious purposes where ground surveillance and control ofairtraffic isdesired.

Systems Planning.-Given aparticular radar set, itissimple enough toprovide abeacon forany special use.
The receiver ofsuch a beacon can beofnarrow bandwidth and tuned tothe frequency ofthe radar.
The reply can beeither atthe same frequency oratone just different enough topermit separation ofradar echoes and beacon replies, but still receivable merely byminor adjustment ofthe radar receiver.
When, however, itisdesired toprovide abeacon that will beuseful to many different radar sets ofthe same type, the problem ismore compli- cated.
Radar sets ofagiven kind are usually operated atsomewhat different frequencies inorder toavoid mutual interference.
Thus, the receiver ofthe beacon has tohave sufficient bandwidth toreceive the interrogating signal from any one ofthe radar sets.
For airborne 3-cm radar sets, forexample, the band from 9320 to9430 Me/see was used.
This band of110Me/see was needed totake care ofthevariations ofthe frequencies ofthemagnetrons asmanufactured plus further changes tobe expected inadjustment and use inthe field.
The reply, however, had tobemade atsome particular frequent y;that used was9310 +2Me/see.
Provision must bemade inthe radar receiver forquick and accurate tuning toachosen beacon reply frequency ifbeacon signals aretobeused.
Radar sets and beacons cannot besodesigned without careful plan- ning.
Ifthe full potentialities ofradar beacons are toberealized, both radar setsandbeacons must beplanned together aspartsojaunified r_adar- beacon sgstem.
Thk now seems trivially obvious, but itisnot theway that much oftheexisting equipment was designed.
Inthedevelopment ofradar, the beacons came asanafterthought.
The result was that SEC.83] GENERAL IL)ENTIFICA TIt)N SYSTEMS, IFF 251 beacon performance often was not sogood ascan beobtained.
The designer offuture radar systems, having knowledgeof radar and radar- beacon possibilities, should decide onthe scope ofdesired operational characteristics ofhissystem and then design hisradar setand beacons together inorder toachieve theresult most efficiently.
Ifthefrequency ofthebeacon reply istobevery different from the frequency ofthe radar transmitter, itisusually necessary toprovide a separate antenna and receiver forthe beacon signals.
The scanning of this second antenna must then besynchronized with that ofthe radar antenna.
Insome cases, this synchronization has been accomplished byusing the same parabolic reflector with separate feeds forthe two frequencies.
Ifthefrequency ofthebeacon isclose tothat oftheradar set, other problems arise.
The same antenna can beused, but then the design of the duplexing system becomes more complex than itisforthe simple radar set.
Attenuation ofthereceived signals atboth frequencies must beheld toasmall amount.
Inany case, itisdesirable toinclude some device that will automati- cally keep the local oscillator forbeacon signals intune.
When the beacon receiver iscompletely separate from the radar receiver, itis advantageous toprovide switching arrangements sothat the radar operator can have hischoice ofeither radar orbeacon signals alone, or both together.
Itisoften useful toinclude separate adjustments forthe saturation levels ofthesignals, sothat stronger beacon signals will stand out when superimposed onsaturated ground ‘(clutter” from the radar.
Also, ifthe pulses ofthe beacon areshort, itispossible toimprove the display bystretching them inthevideo amplifier ofthereceiver.
Some beacons aremade toreply only tointerrogating pulses ofproper length, ortothose having other special characteristics, asdiscussed below.
Insuch cases, the corresponding changes have tobeincluded inthemodulator oftheradar set, with appropriate controlling switches.
The above listofradar design features needed forbest useofbeacons appears somewhat formidable, and soitiswhen one istrying topatch upanantique radar setthat does no~ have such features included inits original design.
When starting afresh, however, thelistdoes notinvolve unreasonable additional complications.
Actually, the most compact airborne microwave radar setproduced during the war was also byfar themost simple tooperate, and itincorporated nearly allofthefeatures mentioned above.
This set, designated AN/APS-10, isdescribed in Chap.
15ofthis book.

General Identification Systems, IFF.—The discussion ofthis chapter isconfined almost entirely tothe use ofbeacons for various navigational problems and for identification systems ofsomewhat 252 RADAR BEACONS [SEC.
84 restricted scope.
Mention should bemade, however, ofthemore general problem ofidentification, which gave rise toasystem known asIFF— Identification ofFriend orFoe.
This system was probably the most important single field ofapplication ofradar beacons inthe war.
The goal was toprovide every friendly military ship and aircraft with atrans- ponder that would give anidentifying reply signal inresponse toproper interrogation.
Since thelocation ofthe ship oraircraft inquestion was almost always determined byradar, the problem was actually one of determining thefriendly orhostile character ofradar targets.
The IFF interrogating equipment was thus used inthe great majority ofcases as anadjunct toaradar set.
The problem was enormously difficult inview oftherapid development ofmany types ofradar sets inboth Britain and America, the tremendous density ofairplane traffic tobedealt with in many theaters and thenecessity forhaving replies coded with sufficient elaborateness toprevent the effective use ofcaptured IFF transponders bythe enemy fordeception.
Inaddition tothese and other inherent technical difficulties, there were still others ofapolitical sort.
Among these were theproblems ofgetting agreement among themany branches ofthe British and U.S.
Armed Services concerning details ofdesired characteristics ofsystems and ofplanning manufacture, distribution, installation, and maintenance ofequipment insuch away that anIFF system could actually gointo effective widespread use inatheater by some target date.
Itseems that problems ofthis sort aretobeencoun- tered inconnection with any such system that ismeant tohave wide- spread use.
Inspite ofallthese difficulties, one such system was put into useinnearly alltheakers, and was ofgreat help where itspotentiali- ties were understood and itslimited traffic-handling capacity was not exceeded.
Itisbeyond the scope ofthis chapter togofurther into the problems ofIFF.
Apeace-time requirement that islikely topose prob- lems ofsimilar character, although oflesser complexity, isthat ofcontrol ofairtraffic inthe neighborhood ofairports where thetraffic islikely to beheavy.

Radar Interrogation vs.
Special Interrogators.-Much ofthe preceding discussion implies that beacons aretobeused principally with radar sets and tobeinterrogated bythem.
For IFF, however, because ofthegreat variety ofradar sets atdifferent wavelengths, itisnecessary topick particular bands offrequencies fortheIFF beacons and tosupply supplementary interrogating equipment towork with the radars.
For every proposed radar application where beacons would beofuse, the question will arise whether itisbetter touseradar beacons ortoprovide such separate equipment towork atfrequencies setaside forthepurpose.
There seems tobenosingle correct answer.
Separate cases must be considered separately, but itisdesirable that insodoing the proposed SEC.8A] RADAR INTERROGATION VS.
SPECIAL INTERROGATORS 253 systems beconceived asbroadly asthepossibilities forunified planning, control, and operation will permit.
Let usfirst consider the planning ofbeacons foruse with airborne radar, which has been the subject ofsome controversy inthe past.
If radar beacons aretobeprovided, awhole new setofthem isrequired for every new band offrequencies used.
British opinion hasinclined tothe view that the resulting multiplicity ofbeacons isintolerable, that it involves fartoogreat acost forthedesign, manufacture, installation, and maintenance ofthese many differrnt beacons.
The British policy has been todesign forevery radar setasupplementary synchronous beacon interrogator for interrogating beacons inthe 200-Mc/sec region and receiving replies atsuch afrequency, thereplies tobedisplayed whenever possible onthe indicator ofthe radar set.
These interrogators were tobereplaced indue course with similar equipment operating atanew and higher region offrequency.
Special separate antennas areobviously required.
The contrary view, more widely held inthe United States, is that the provision ofsuitable beacons isbut asmall part ofthe over-all complication and expense ofintroducing radar inanew band offre- quency; that the frequencies used forradar sets forany given purpose tend togroup inasmall number ofreasonably narrow bands; that since the radar setitself can beasgood aninterrogator-responsor as onecould desire, itisputting complication inthewrong place toadd more equipment toacrowded airplane; and that the display ofthe beacon signals and the performance asawhole will beinferior when the beacon frequency isconsiderably below theradar frequency.
The decision must depend, toaconsiderable extent, onthe relative importance ofusing beacons fornavigation and foridentification.
For anidentification system, itisobviously necessary tohave but one rela- tively simple type ofbeacon and torequire that theidentifying radar sets beaccommodated toit.
For navigational purposes, the requirements ofthe airplane become relatively more important.
Ifallinformation needed forthe desired use can beobtained with beacon signals alone, itisnotnecessary tohave aproper radar setatall, and the radar set can then bereplaced byaninterrogator-responsor.
This has atransmitter and receiver like those ofaradar set, but itisin general somewhat smaller and lighter since not somuch transmitted power isrequired fortriggering beacons asisrequired forgetting adequate radar echoes.
Such equipments can beespecially economical insize and weight ifrange only is\\-anted, orifthe sort ofazimuth information obtainable bylobe-s~vitching isadequate.
Insuch cases thesets can be run atlow frequencies, and the equipment isrelatively compact.
If, however, itisdesired tohave I’PI presentation ofthe beacon signals, which affords azimuth information comparable tothat given bymodern 254 RADAR BEACONS [SEC.
85 radar sets, theinterrogator-responsorbecomessonearlyacompleteradar setthat itmay aswell bemade tobeone.
Inthe case ofbeacons carried byaircraft toextend the range and to facilitate identification byground radar sets, i~isobviously desirable to have only one type ofbeacon forallaircraft under the surveillance ofa comprehensive system oflike ground radar sets.
Itisalso desirable that these beacons give signals ofthesame degree ofresolution inazimuth as that oftheradar signals.
Itseems likely that theradar sets and beacons will bedesigned together asparts ofasystem operating at3000 31c/sec orhigher.
There appears tobelittle tobegained bytrying tohave this system operate atthe same frequencies asthe beacons foruse with air- borne radar sets unless itisrequired that thesame beacons that aretobe interrogated bythe ground radar sets also reply tointerrogation by airborne radar sets.
8.5.
Independence ofInterrogation and Reply .—Although thefunda- mental considerations that underlie the design ofbeacons and beacon systems arethesame asthose forradar ingeneral, there arecertain con- sequences ofthealmost complete independence oftheinterrogation and reply links that need explicit mention.
Range.—The expression forthepower received bythebeacon isgiven byEq.

This cannot be defined asclearly asisR!since having asignal “satisfactory” isless definite than having iteither present orabsent.
The other quantities inEq.
(3)areofobvious significance ifitiskept inmind that the sub- script rrefers tothereply link.
Inthepreceding paragraphs itwas assumed that thetriggering ofthe beacon and the intensity ofthe displayed reply depend onthe pulse powers ofthe two pulses.
This implies that both the receiver inthe beacon and the one inthe interrogating system have abandwidth suffi- cient toinsure that both received signals rise toavalue that depends on thepulse po\ver and isindependent ofthelength ofthepulse \vithin wide limits.
This condition isusually the desired one and the receivers are designed accordingly.
Ifareceiver ofvery narrow bandwidth should beused, however, thepeak value ofitsoutput would then depend upon the energy ofthe pulse, rather than upon the pulse power.
For such cases Eqs.
(2)and (3)would bemodified bysubstituting thetransmitted and received values ofthe energies per pulse forthe respective pulse- power values.
Itissensible todesign the system sothat R;NR:since there isno useinhaving replies that aretoo weak tobeobserved even though the beacon isbeing interrogated, ascan bethe case ifR:<R?.Likewise nothing isgained bymaking provision forstrong replies ifthey areabsent because ofthe failure ofthe interrogation.
This situation can arise if R:>R!.The common value ofR!=R$must bemade equal tothe desired maximum range, and indesd somewhat larger ifareasonable factor ofsafety isdesired.
Itissometimes useful tomake R;somewhat larger than R:iuorder tofacilitate recognition bytheoperator ofbeacon signals inthenoise. 256 RADAR BEACONS [SEC.
85 Inthe case ofbeacons interrogated and received bya radar set, ~,is nearly equal toX,;(Gd ~..usually equals (GE,) ~..since thesame antenna islikely tobeinvolved; and (GR,)~~.
usually equals (G~,)~,.
since beacon antennas forreceiving and transmitting need tohave thesame radiation pattern and aretherefore alike.
The condition forbalance ofthe two links, namely that R:equal R:,then becomes (4) The receiver ofthebeacon isalmost always less sensitive than that ofthe radar, either bynecessity (because ofthe greater bandwidth), orby choice toavoid undesired triggering (see below); hence P:,<P~i.In the balanced system, then, thetransmitter ofthebeacon may aswell be less powerful than that ofthe radar inthe same proportion.
Inactual cases, Eq.
(1)and acorresponding equation forthereceived power inthe reply link involve two additional factors.
One ofthese isa geometrical factor that expresses the effects ofinterference and diffrac- tion.
The other takes account oftheattenuation oftheradiation inthe atmosphere.
These matters asthey pertain toradar echoes are dis- cussed inSees.
2“12and 2.15.
Itshould benoted, however, that the numerical factors appropriate here arethesquare roots ofthose forradar signals, when for the latter the effects onboth the transmitted and reflected pulses are lumped together.
These factors drop out ofthe expression (4)just astheantenna gains do,since they have thesame value forboth links.
Inany beacon system inwhich thefrequencies ofinter- rogation and reply aresubstantially different, however, allofthefactors inEqs.
(2)and (3)must beretained and these additional ones must be added.
The two links have tobedesigned separately toget proper operation atallranges uptosome fixed value ortomeet other particular requirements.
Itisapparent from Eq.
(1)that another consequence ofthe inde- pendence ofthetwo links isadifferent law fortherelation between signal strength and range.
Radar echoes vary inpulse power asthe inverse fourth power ofthefree-space range, whereas beacon replies vary only as the inverse square.
Ingeneral, beacon signals donot vary asmuch between particular values ofrange, donot cut offasabruptly with increasing range, and donot give asdeep interference minima asradar signals do.
Azimuth.—One further consequence oftheseparation ofthetwo links isthat thescanning sector through which beacon replies areobtained is limited either inthe interrogation link orinthe reply link according to circumstances.
Equation (1)becomes more generally (5) SEC.
85] INDEPENDENCE OF INTERROGATION AND REPLY 257 Here P~iistheavailable pulse power atthebeacon forany relative posi- tion ofthe interrogator and the beacon.
The gain ofthe transmitting antenna, G~,, isavariable that depends upon theangular position ofthe antenna with respect tothe line from ittothe beacon.
The received power isamaximum only when theinterrogator isreally looking atthe beacon.
Similarly GEi, the gain ofthe beacon receiving antenna, isa variable depending ontheorientation oftheantenna with respect tothe line from the beacon totheinterrogator.
Let usconsider, asanexample, aground radar setscanning around through the complete azimuth circle and interrogating anairborne bea- con.
Curve aofFig.

The line tothe beacon isassumed tobethe upward vertical.
Inthe ideal case the curve isthe same as the antenna pattern oftheradar; in actual cases itisoften modified by reflections from near-by buildings, hills, etc.
Ifcircle breprese,,ts the threshold power fortriggering, the beacon will betriggered only through the sector AOA’.
If,however, the values ofreceived power should all beincreased by12dborso(by de- creasing the range tothe beacon), thebeacon would also beinterrogated byside lobes oftheantenna.
Figure 8.8shows this effect.
Itisclear that ifwe consider interrogation that begins when the separation isfirst large and then decreases, thebeaconFIG.S.7.—Schematic logarithmic polar diagram oftheantenna pattern ofa microwave radar.
The triggering ofa beacon occurs when theenergy radiated inagiven direction isinexcess ofsome necessary minimum amount.
— isfirst interrogated atmaximum range through avery narrow angular region.
Astherange decreases, thesector ofinterrogation increases, but remains ofthe order ofmagnitude ofthe half-power beamwidth ofthe antenna until arange about one tenth ofmaximum isreached.
There, assuming the side lobes ofthe antenna pattern tobeabout 20db down, side-lobe interrogation begins and grows with decreasing range.
Finally, inpractical cases, arange isreached forwhich the beacon is interrogated nomatter which way theantenna ispointed.
Itisalso clear that reduction ofthe radiated power would produce anarrowing ofthe sector ofinterrogation ofany particular beacon, but would lead tofailure tointerrogate those atgreatest range. 258 ItAl)AIt BEACONS [S,,c, S3 Similar considerations apply tothe reply link.
Ifweassume the beacon toreinterrogated forallangular positions oftheantmma ofthe interrogator and the sensitivity ofthe receiver tobekept constant, theangular width ofthebeacon arconthe PPI tube \rillvaryas didthe sector ofinterrogation inthe previous case.
Overa large distance the reply arcwill beoftheorder ofmagnitude ofthehalf-po\rer bcam\ridth of the receiving antenna.
For close-in beacons, extensions attributable to side lobes appear, and forvcry close beacons acomplete circle isobtained, The complete circle orside-lobe pattern can bereduced tothenarro\r arc bysuitable reduction ofthe gain ofthe radar receiver, again \vith th(, loss ofmore distant beacons.

The gain isthus automatically adjusted tobecorrect forbeacons atallranges with theresult that they allappear asapproximate half-power bearnwidth arcs.
This circuit must becare- fully designed ifitistogive good results with ground radars interrogating beacons onaircraft flying inthemaximum ofthepattern ofthereceiving antenna and still not unduly attenuate weaker replies from beacons in low-flying aircraft.
Itisclear from theforegoing that thewidth ofthereply arcisalways limited ineither onelink ortheother, whichever isthenarrower, and that itcan becontrolled byadjusting either transmitted power orreceiver gain.
Where manual adjustment for good reception ofaparticular beacon istobeused, cutting down the transmitted power would be  260 RADAR BEACONS [SEC.
8.6 lower than that ofthe radar byafactor of20orso.
Either the beam- width oftheantenna forreceiving replies from thebeacon ismade very broad orthis antenna ismade omnidirec bional.
Microwave angular discrimination isstill provided bythe sharpness ofthe interrogating beam—again only forbeacons atranges beyond that forwhich side lobes begin tocause broadening ofthereply.
Figure 8.9shows awhole setof replies from such abeacon, exposures having been made every few sweeps ofthePPI.
The interrogations were at10cm, thereplies at1.5m.
The principal reason forusing such abeacon rather than one that gives a microwave reply isthe relative simplicity ofthe low-frequency trans- mitter and antenna ofthe beaeon.
Also, byplacing several simple antennas and receivers fortheinterrogation atdifferent places onanair- craft, itispossible toachieve agood approximation toaneffectively omnidirectional pattern for the interrogation link.
This isalmost impossible toachieve with single simple microwave antennas because of interference effects.
Itisnecessary toput the outputs ofsuch multiple receivers inparallel after detection sothat there will notbeacombination ofr-fsignals invarying phases togive rise tointerference maxima and minima.
The foregoing discussion implies that the broadening ofthe arcs for beacon replies isgreater than that forradar signals.
This isnotthecase, however, ifthemaximum range forboth isthesame.
IfG~U and G(,oh) aretherespective gains oftheantenna atthecenter ofthepattern and at the maximum ofthefirst side lobe and R!and R;[l.h)the corresponding maximum ranges for interrogation ofthe beacon (to give minimum triggering power), from Eq.
(5)wegetGJ(R:) 2=G(l.~)/R~O.~).
The same line ofargument followed through with theradar equation gives P-J(R:) 4=G2(]~~)/R&~), which gives the same value ofR,(,ok) when R:isthesame.
Inpractice, however, thebroadening ofthebeacon signals islikely tobegreater since i~iscustomary and usually desirable tosetthe sensitivity ofthe beacon receiver sothat the maximum free- space range isconsiderably greater than the radar range toanaverage target.
This isdone partly toensure increased range and partly toallow for the considerable unavoidable variations between the receivers of different beacons asinstalled and operated.
8.6.
Frequency Considerations.
General.4ince beacon replies are much like radar echoes, the considerations involved inchoosing the fre- quency region forasystem inorder togetthedesired resolution aremuch the same.
Ingeneral, the higher thefrequency, the better theazimuth discrimination for agiven tolerable size ofantenna system.
This advantage ofimproved angular separation with increased frequency is somewhat offset byatendency toward increased size and weight oftrans- mitters needed foragiven range performance. SEC.86] FREQUENCY CONSIDERATIONS 261 The most satisfactory presentation ofbeacon replies forpurposes of ordinary navigation isundoubtedly the PPI since itgives the whole situation ataglance inadirect way.
The angular widths ofbeacon replies should belimited toafew degrees, ifpossible.
For anairborne interrogator this suggests the use of3-cm orshorter wavelength; for systems having ground interrogators with large antenna arrays acon- siderably lower frequency can beused.
Azimuth determination bylobe- switching, involving comparison between thestrengths ofsignals received ontwo antennas pointed indifferent directions, isadequate formany purposes butrelatively clumsy inuse.
Itpermits theuseoflower frequen- cies and much broader antenna patterns, with corresponding reduction insize ofthe antennas, but itresults inagreat increase inthe diffi- culty ofidentifying beacon replies with particular radar echoes.
Itis, however, satisfactory foraircraft homing onthebeacon.
Inthewartime systems which provided means ofprecise navigation byaccurate measure- ment cfthe ranges totwo ground beacons atknown positions, special indicators were used.
They displayed and measured thepositions ofthe steady beacon signals obtained byusing omnidirectional antennas rather than scanners.
There isanupper limit onthefrequency towhich itisdesirable togo.
Atabout 15,000 to20,000 Me/see theattenuation bywater vapor inthe atmosphere oftheearth begins tobecome ofconsequence.
Inconditions ofbad weather, when navigational beacons aremost needed, therange of beacons atsuch frequencies would belowered somuch that they would beoflittle use.
Innearly allcases, thefrequency ofthebeacon reply should bediffer- entenough from that oftheinterrogating pulses toobviate simultaneous recephion ofbeacon replies and radar echoes byonereceiver.
Inthis way the swamping ofbeacon replies bystrong echoes iseliminated.
Even when itisdesirable that radar echoes and beacon replies bepresented simultaneously, the saturation video levels forthe two kinds ofsignals canbemade different byusing separate receivers; thus beacon replies can bemade tostand outeven when superimposed onsaturated ground clutter.
Avery striking differentiation between radar and beacon signals from aircraft has been achieved byputting them onseparate PPI tubes that give signals intwo different colors, the signals being effectively super- imposed byoptical means.
Ifany interrogator orradar setofagiven type istobeable tolocate a beacon readily, thebeacon must transmit atsome known frequency and the receiver forthe signals must bereadily tunable tothat precise fre- quent y,whether thebeacon replies arerewived ornot.
When thelWa- tion ofthebeacon isunknown (asisusually thecase) and theinterrogator isscanning, itisnot tolerable toincrease the general uncertainty about 262 RADAR BEACONS [SEC,86 the beacon byhaving tosearch over aband 01frequencies.
Thus, ade- quate stabilization ofthebeacon transmitter isrequired, and thereceiver forthe signals must have automatic frequency control, orawavemeter must beprovided, oritmust bepossible tosetthefrequency accurately topreset values byhaving mechanical parts ofsufficient precision.
All ofthese techniques have been worked out and arenow available.
This useofaspot frequency forthe reply does have adisadvantage, however.
Each interrogating radar will receive not only the responses ofthebeacon toitsinterrogation pulses, but also thebeacon responses to interrogating pulses from other sets.
The replies that aradar setreceives toitsown pulses are synchronous and appear atthe proper range ina regular way.
Replies toother radar sets are, ingeneral, notsynchronous.
This isdiscussed further inSec.

For(~)thedistribution depends onthefrequency.
Sweeping Frequency.
-In some cases ithas not been feasible touse a single spot frequency ofreply either because thenumber ofreplies atthe frequency would beexcessive orbecause itwas not practical tomodify a group ofradar sets toreceive the chosen frequency.
Inthese cases, beacons have been used inwhich the common frequency ofreceiver and transmitter was made tosweep periodically over theband offrequencies ofthe interrogators.
Agiven interrogator got replies when the beacon came into tune with it.
This system isuseful only with interrogators that arepointed continuously atthe beacon.
Ifthe interrogator scans inspace, itwill notingeneral bepointed atthebeacon during theinterval that thebeacon istuned toitsfrequency band unless thescanning period ismade short compared with theinterval during which thebeacon replies.
Some such beacons have asingle tube used both asasuperregenerative receiver and asapulsed transmitting oscillator sothat bymechanical changes ofthe tuning ofthe resonant circuit both frequencies can be changed together.
The frequency forreception and that fortransmis- sion arenearly the same; they arenot identical because ofthe different voltages and transit times involved atthetwo clifferen tlevels ofoperation.
Figure 8.10 shows two readily realizable cycles ofvariation offrequency SEC.87] INTERR~A TIONCODES 263 with time.
The intersections ofthe horizontal lines with the sawtooth curves give thetimes atwhich replies arereceived byaradar tuned tothe frequency corresponding tothe horizontal line.
Incase aallinterroga- tors atdifferent frequency getregularly spaced pulses, incase bthey come inpairs, thegrouping depending onthefrequency.
This useofasingle tube forreceiver and transmitter isconvenient especially because ittends tomitigate theeffects ofantenna mismatch often encountered ininstalla- tions inthe field.
The shift offrequency for both transmitter and receiver isautomatically almost exactly the same.
Separate receivers and transmitters whose tuning controls have been ganged can beused ifdesired but this method requires more care indesign and installation.
CODING The simplest type ofbeacon replies ~vith asingle pulse toevery pulse ofsufficient strength received within acertain band offrequency.
For purposes ofreducing interrogation byconfining ittoonly those interr~ gators that are intentionally seeking beacon replies, coding ofthe interrogation may beused.
Likewise, the replies may bemade more complicated inavariety ofways forthe purpose either ofidentifying the beacon orofusing itasapart ofanauxiliary communication system.
8.7.
Interrogation Codes.
Frequency.
-If the beacon isone that replies toallradars ofagiven type, thefrequency forinterrogation isnot highly characteristic.
Ifitisone tobeused inasystem with specially designed interrogator-responsors, certain discrete interrogation fre- quencies can beused aspart ofacode characterizing the particular beacon.
PulseLength.—In order toavoid excess interrogation ofground beacons byairborne radars notinterested inbeacon replies, some beacons have been designed sothat they aretriggered only bypulses longer than those used for ordinary radar search.
Careful design ofthe beacon receiver isrequired toprevent the stretching ofstrong, short pulses to give thesame effects aslonger ones ofmedium strength, but this problem has been solved satisfactorily.
The beacon reply isobviously delayed since itcannot occur until after thelapse ofatime longer than thedura- tion ofthe search pulse.
This delay must beallowed forinestimating therange tothe beacon.
Multiple Pulses.—The beacon can bemade toinclude adecoder so that atrigger isdeveloped only upon reception ofapair ofpulses having the proper separation, oritcan bemade sothat itwill reply only upon reception ofasbillmore complicated group ofproperly spaced pulses.
Aconsiderable time delay may beinvolved, but inmany cases this can beobviated byhaving thesweep oftheinterrogating radar started bythe last ofthe group ofinterrogating pulses.
One ofthe prinrip:d benefits 264 RADAR BEACONS [SEC.
88 tobederived bythe use ofthis more complicated system isrelative freedom from random triggering byother radar sets inthesame band since the probability ofgetting such agroup ofpulses byaccident decreases rapidly asthe complication ofthe group increases.
This matter isdis- cussed more fully below.
Allsuch systems, however, aresubject tosome difficulties resulting from thepresence ofreflected signals that aredelayed because ofthe longer path traversed.
Two-frequency lntemogation.-Another method related tothe use of groups ofpulses isthe use ofcoincident interrogation attwo different frequencies.
The two pulses may beactually coincident, orone delayed with respect tothe other byany fixed amount.
Both the value ofthe second frequency and that ofthedelay give additional coding possibility ies.
Communication bytheInterrogation Link.—So far, methods ofinterro- gation coding have been discussed which determine whether ornot the beacon will reply when interrogated.
More complicated schemes for coding theinterrogating beam enable thetransmission ofinformation to thevehicle carrying thebeacon.
Such schemes areusually applied only incases where the interrogating antenna points continuously atthe beacon.
Information inthetelegraph code can beconveyed byturning theinterrogator onand off,byvarying thewidth ofthepulses, bychang- ingthespacing betweeh pairs ofthem, bychanging thenumber ofpulses ingroups, and byvarying thepulse repetition rate.
When therepeti tion rate ismade high enough, the relative spacing ofpairs ofpulses or the pulse width can bevaried atvoice frequencies togive telephonic communication.
88.
Reply Codes.
Frequency .—Some coding can behad byuse of several spot frequencies forbeacon replies.
GapCoding.—The beacon transmitter can beturned onand offto give Morse letters.
This system isuseful only when theinterrogator is expected tolook atthe beacon steadily.
Avariant that has been sug- gested foruse with scanning radars isarapid code ofthis kind which would break thereply arconthePPI into dots and dashes.
Only simple codes could beused because ofthe limitation ofbeamwidth and the complete uncertainty astothe part ofthe coding cycle forwhich the broken reply arcwould becentered.
WidthCoding.
—Letters ofthe Morse code can betransmitted by changing thewidth ofthepulses intheproper sequence instead ofturning the pulses onand off.
Beacons emitting such width-modulated replies will give adisplay onscanning radars and have theadditional slow gap code which can beread iftheseaming isstopped.
Range Coding.
-Codes readily visible onthePPI, asinFigs.
8.2a and 8.2b,areobtained byhaving thetrigger operate acoder that causes the emission ofanumber ofreply pulses.
These may begrouped intime in SEC.
8.9] TRAFFIC CAPACITY 265 different ways inorder togive vzmious groups inapparent range onthe indicator.
They areinstantly readable byrapidly scanning radars, but.
have thedisadvantage ofbeing more subject toconfusion byoverlapping patterns, when numerous beacons arepresent atnearly thesame bearing, than arereplies that give simpler patterns.
VoiceCommunication.
—Here also, when the repetition rate ishigh enough, therelative spacing ofpairs ofreply pulses orthewidth ofpulses canbevaried atvoice frequency togive telephonic communication, usable when theinterrogate or-responsor points steadily atthebeacon.
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 8.9.
Tra5c Capacity .-For every beacon there issome limit tothe total amount ofenergy itcan radiate per second, with acorresponding limitation ofthe number ofitsreplies per second and ofthenumber of interrogators that can work with itsimultaneously.
Beacons have been made inwhich the limit tothe rate ofreply was setbythe amount of interrogation necessary tooverheat thebeacon until itstarted afire, but this informal system has drawbacks.
Itisusually desirable toincor- porate anarrangement forlimiting the average rate ofreply toasafe value.
There aretwo principal ways ofdoing this.
Inthefirst method, thesensitivity ofthebeacon receiver isdecreased asthe average number ofreplies increases.
Weaker interrogations are thus rejected and thereplies arelimited tostronger interrogate msupto the maximum number tolerable.
For navigational beacons, ingeneral, this isnot agood scheme since ittends toeliminate replies tothe more distant interrogators, which are likely tobethe ones most inneed of getting them.
For some purposes, where beacons ofshort range areto beused inconnection with landing systems, this might prove tobea useful method.
The second method involves reducing the ratio ofthe number of replies tothenumber ofinterrogations tokeep thetotal number ofreplies within the safe limit.
The beacon display ofallinterrogators issome- what impaired ifthere issufficient overinterrogation toreduce this ratio markedly, but there isnodiscrimination against thefar-off interrogators.
This result isaccomplished byvarying theperiod ofinsensitivity ofthe beacon following the emission ofitscoded reply.
There isalways a finite minimum time between successive beacon replies; the maximum number ofpossible replies isthus the reciprocal ofthis time.
Usually this maximum number istoogreat forsafety unless the“dead” time has deliberately been made greater than itwould naturally be.
The simplest way toprotect the beacon against overloading istoarrange that the receiver will always bedead forthedesired time after making areply and will then recover sensitivity soquickly that stronger interrogators are 266 RADAR BEACONS [SEC.
89 not favored.
This simple system can lead tooccasional unnecessary interference ofone interrogator with another.
Let usassume, for example, that there arebut twointerrogators and that thebeacon could readily reply toboth steadily.
Ifthedead time islong, there will never- theless betimes when the interrogations from one beacon will arrive in thedead time following thereply totheother.
Amore complicated sys- tem that avoids this defect has been used.
The dead time isnormally short but isarranged toincrease, asneeded, with increasing average rate ofinterrogation.
Too short adead time can betroublesome, foritmay lead tomultiple interrogation bythe same interrogator pulse that has reached thebeacon not only directly, but also byother and longer paths involving reflection.
IfWrepresents theprobability ythat thebeacon will reply toaninter- rogating pulse ofsufficient strength, itiseasy toshow byastatistical argument that w>J-I+nr and w<1 l+(n– 1),(6) (7) Inthese expressions, nisthenumber oflike interrogators having almost equal recurrence rates, and 7isthe ratio ofthe dead time tothe total interval between interrogating pulses.
Thus risthefraction ofthetime that the beacon isinsensitive toasecond interrogator ifitisreplying fully toafirst one.
Ifthe recurrence rates ofthe interrogators were exactly equal, there would beafixed phase relationship between pulses and thestatistical argument would beinapplicable.
When interrogating radars have crystal-controlled repetition rates that are almost exactly equal, theradar that first emits itspulses may foratime steal thebeacon completely away from asecond radar that emits itspulses somewhat later.
Equation (6) results from assuming complete randomness of interrogations, and gives aresult that isabsurd when there isbut one interrogator.
Equation (7)results when weassume that theprobability ofreply toaparticular pulse from one interrogator iscompletely unin- fluenced bytheexistence oftheother interrogations bythat interrogator.
This assumption isfalse since there isindirectly such aninfluence.
The exact expression forWiscumbersome but this isoflittle practical con- sequence since itneed not beused.

For certain actual microwave radars and beacons, something like five radars giving steady interrogations are allowable without serious impairment ofthepresentation.
Where necessary, this number can beincreased by designing the beacon tohave ashorter dead time.
Sofarinthis discussion, the results ofscanning bytheinterrogating radars have been ignored.
Ifa radar scans through 360° and inter- rogates thebeacon through only 6°~ itwill load the beacon only +as much asifitpointed atitsteadily.
The traffic capacity ofthebeacons insuch asystem isincreased bya factor ofabout 60.
Actually, itis necessary totake account ofthe statistical fluctuations oftheinter- rogation.
Therefore, the number ofinterrogating radars should ben FIG.S.11.—The fraction ofinterrogating pulses, W,getting replies asafunction of thenumber oftheinterrogating radar sets, n.
substantially less than would beallowable ifthey remained uniformly spaced intheir intervals ofinterrogation.
Interrogating planes near the beacon tend tointerrogate through much greater sectors oftheir scan and thus load thebeacon disproportionately.
For this reason, control ofthe width ofthe reply arcs bydecreasing the interrogating power would be desirable.
Inany case, iflarge traffic istobeexpected, itisdesirable tousesome sort ofinterrogation coding toensure that beacons will betriggered only bythose radar sets that want tolook atthem, and not byones uninter- ested ingetting replies from thebeacon.
The effectiveness ofmultiple-pulse interrogation codes incutting down unwanted beacon replies can beseen asfollows.
Let usassume that Nrandom pulses persecond arereceived byabeacon, and that the beacon istriggered ifany pulse isfollowed byasecond one that arrives later byaninterval oftime between D–Tand D+T.Disthedelay, and ~Tisthetolerance.
Each pulse thus produces afollowing interval 268 RADAR BEACONS [SEC.
8.10 ofsensitivity totriggering byasecond pulse ofamount 2T.
IfNpulses arrive per second onthe average, the average sensitive time per second willbe2TN.
This isalso thefraction ofthetime that thebeacon issen- sitive, orthe probability that arandom pulse will find itsensitive and trigger it.
Since Nrandom pulses arrive per second the number of triggering persecond will beNtimes this probability, or2TN2.
Thus, theratio ofthenumber ofbeacon replies tothenumber ofrandom pulses persecond is2TN.
If,forexample, T=5psec and N=500 pps, the product 2TN has avalue of~~, the number ofrandom triggerings per second being reduced from 500 to2.5.
Ifathree-pulse code isused, a similar argument applies forthethird pulse and anadditional factor of 2TN will come intogive 4T2N3 asthe number ofrandom replies per second.
The argument also applies totwo-frequency interrogation.
IIere thenumber ofrandom interrogations will be2TNIN2 ifNIand Nzare the respective random rates atthe two frequencies, and the beacon is made sothat thetwo pulses have toarrive inacertain order fortrigger- ingtooccur.
Ifthe order isimmaterial, the rate ofrandom interroga- tion will betwice asgreat, namely, ATNIN2.
Inmaking acomparison between thetwo systems, itisnecessary to keep inmind that one must use estimates ofthe numbers ofrandom pulses that will bepresent after thesystem hasbeen introduced.
Chang- ing radar sets togive double pulses increases the number atthe radar frequency; adding coincident interrogating pulses atasecond frequency increases thenumber atthat frequency.

Unsynchronized Replies.-JVhen abeacon isbeing interrogated byseveral radars atthesame time itreplies toall,and thereceiver ofeach interrogator-responsor will respond toallofthese signals.
Replies tothe interrogation byaparticular radar aresynchronized and give astationary pattern onitsindicator asdoitsradar echoes; thereplies tointerrogations bythe other radar sets appear tobeunsynchronized and thus show at random onthescreen and aresimilar torandom noise from other causes.
Figure 8.12 shows several beacon signals appearing onthePPI ofa3-cm radar; oneofthem issufficiently overinterrogated toshow unsynchronized replies.
This effect isdispleasing aesthetically, butexperience hasshown that agreat amount ofoverinterrogation isnecessary tointerfere seriously with recognition ofthebeacon.
The problem ismore troublesome when numerous adjscent ground orship interrogators are interrogating nu- merous airborne beacons.
Unsynchronized replies coming from themulti- pleinterrogation ofanear-by beacon may interfere with detection ofthe signals from one farther away atthe same azimuth.
Itisdifficult to make adefinite statement about theextent oftheinterference because it depends somuch onthe characteristics ofthe radar set.

Itsfunction isto accept r-fenergy from thetransmission line, todistribute this energy into space asdesired, togather intheradar echoes ofthis energy, and todirect these echoes back into thetransmission line.
Since the nature ofelec- tromagnetic radiation issuch that agood transmitting antenna isalso a good receiving antenna, weneed consider only theformer function.
In most cases theantenna isrequired toform theenergy into asharp beam which may beaimed invarious directions.
The supporting structure is known asthe“pedestal,” and theentire assembly istermed the“antenna mount” or“scanner.” 1Airplanes and ships are notoriously unsteady vehicles, whose motions disturb the direction ofaradar beam ofenergy transmitted from them.
The compensation forsuch motions iscalled “stabilization.’ ) 9.1.
The Antenna Equation.’—Two ofthe salient requirements of most radar sets arethat they beable toreveal distant objects and beable togive accurately the direction ofsuch objects.
The design ofthe antenna has agreat influence onthe attainment ofthese requirements.
Wehave seen (Sec.
2.1) that under certain conditions themaximum range ofdetection ofagiven target varies asthesquare root ofthearea ofthe antenna.
This isone reason forthe use oflarge antennas.
Another advantage oflarge antennas, having todowith theresolution oftheradar set, isthat the beamwidth varies inversely asthelinear dimension ofthe antenna.
Mathematically thebeamwidth e(degrees) isusually related tothewidth Doftheantenna and thewavelength 1oftheradiation by theapproximate formula (1) ifDand Xaremeasured inthe same units.

Round and Cut Paraboloid Antemas.-One very common type ofmicrowave radar antenna takes the form ofaparaboloidal reflector 1 with asource ofradiation, or“antenna feed, ”atitsfocus.
Since the /+’ FIG.

Figure 9.2does not explain the side lobes orthe beamwidth, but itdoes serve toemphasize the fact that thefeed isalways sodesigned astobedirective.
Figure 9.3represents anautomatic record of the energy radiated atvarious angles from a well-designed feed, thedirectional power being displayed asafunction ofangle.
Itisobvious that nearly alloftheenergy from thefeed will strike aproperly placed paraboloid, which will then collimate the radiation.

Itisanimportant fact that thebeamwidth asmeasured vertically depends, according toEq.
(l),upon the vertical dimension ofthe cut paraboloid, and the horizontal beam- width depends upon thehorizontal dimension.
Thus, inorder torealize high resolution inazimuth, theantenna must bewide but notnecessarily tall, whereas aheight-finding radar, affording accurate measurement of theangular elevation ofanairplane, must have atallantenna which need not bewide.
These two types are exemplified bythe scanners shown inFigs.
9.15 and 9.14 respectively.

We have not mentioned the “mattress” type ofantenna, which is perhaps the most familiar tothe public because itiscommonly seen on naval ships.

They are widely used in radars ofwavelength over 1m.
With the trend toward shorter wave- length, themattress antennas aregiving way tothetypes discussed above.

Fan Beams.—One ofthefunctions forwhich airborne radars are designed isaiding airnavigation, and anextremely important type of airborne navigational radar presents amap ofthe terrain around the aircraft.
Inorder tomap the ground the transmitted energy must be directed toward the ground, and rather than having the energy beamed like asearchlight, a“fan beam” must beemployed asshown inFig.
9.6 forcomplete coverage.
Auniformly intense map isdesired, which will display ground objects that lieatdepression angles between, forexample, 5°and 70°below thehorizontal.
The energy inthefanbeam must there- fore beproperly distributed togive adequate illumination ofthe most distant objects while not overilluminating those which are atgreater depression angles.
Itcan beshown, subject tocertain simplifying assumptions, that the energy should bedistributed asthe square ofthe cosecant ofthe depression angle (see Sec.
2.5).
Figure 9.7shows how well such apattern isrealized inpractice, with anantenna 12in.inheight (shown inFig.

Figure 9.10 shows two distortions ofaparaboloid used for this purpose.
Another widely used method employs acylindrical rejlector, shaped like theblade ofasnowplow orbulldozer, and having only single curvature (Fig.

Such areflector isilluminated bythe radiation from alinear feed rather than apoint feed.
Inthis case thelinear feed defines the beam sharpness inregard toazimuth and the reflector dis- tributes the energy inelevation.
The ray diagram shown inl’ig.

Inthis figure thelinear feed isimagined perpendicular totheplane ofthe drawing.
The feed isfrequently the straight opening between two identical parallel conducting sheets which arejoined along their curved backs byaparabolic reflector strip.
Just inside thecenter oftheopening, atthefocus oftheparabolic strip, islocated theopen end ofawaveguide which irradiates the parabola, thereby setting upthe propagation of energy between the two sheets and straight out through the opening.
This assembly iscalled a‘‘pillbox.” Microwaves may bepropagated between the sheets with the electric field polarized either parallel or perpendicular tothesheets.

Nonscan.ning Antennas.-There are certain types ofradar antenna which arenot ordinarily required toscan.
Inthis category are the end-fire antennas which aresometimes attached toairborne guns in order topermit radar range-finding.
Asanexample, one end-fire linear array (Fig.
9.11) isaseries ofdipoles excited insuch aphase relationship that their energy isbeamed inthedirection ofthearray.
Another end- fire array isthe Yagi antenna.
Commonly, this isanarray ofdipoles, only one ofwhich isexcited bythetransmission line; behind itisapara- sitic reflector dipole and infront areseveral parasitic director dipoles.
The 278 ANTENNAS, SCANNERS, AND STABILIZATION [SEC.94 Yagiarray has been widely used forwavelengths ofseveral decimeters; anexample isshown inFig.

Bycorrect design ofsuch anantenna the pattern canbemade reasonably uniform inazimuth and atthesame time well confined totheregion ofthehorizon.
Like other beacon antennas, the antennas used forIFF equipment arenot strictly radar equipment and will not bediscussed.
The same statement applies tothe antennas used inthesearch and jamming functions ofradar countermeasures.
9.6.
Construction ofRadar Antemas.-The main requirements inthe mechanical construction ofairborne antennas areaccuracy ofform, the ability towithstand field service conditions, and light weight.
Surface- based antennas must benoless accurate, and considerations ofweight, inertia, and wind forces are paramount.
Considerable advances have been made inthemechanical design ofairborne, and particularly ofsur- face-based, antennas formicrowave radar during the recent war.
In this section only antennas inwhich thefeed isdistinct from thereflector areconsidered; array antennas arenot discussed.
Sheet aluminum ormagnesium alloy isalways used forthe airborne reflectors.
Small reflectors upto30in.indiameter aresimply spun or otherwise formed, abead around therim being added forstiffness, asin Fig.
9.17.
The tolerance allowable inthesurface ofthereflector isabout ~+ ofawavelength.
The larger sizes ofairborne reflectors, whether paraboloid orshaped cylindrical surfaces, thus farinstalled inastreamlined airplane arecon- siderably wider than high and areused forcircular scanning.
Onthese itisgood practice touseaircraft construction methods.
The selection of materials used depends upon the size ofthe reflector and the stresses involved.
Magnesium oraluminum alloy will serve forairborne equip- ment.
Since aluminum alloy has better forming characteristics than magnesium, itisconsidered thebest material forthereflector face.
The most accurate method offorming aluminum alloy sheet forthereflector face isbystretching the material over ametal diewhich has been cast and ground tothe desired contour; these dies are usually made from Kirksite, alead and zinc alloy.
After forming, thesheet metal conforms totheexact contour ofthedieproviding thedraw isshallow enough, asis thecase with most radar reflectors.
The next problem istosupport this reflector face rigidly and tomaintain the contour already obtained by forming.
This canbedone, asinthe5-ft reflector ofAN/APQ-13 shown inFig.

Surface-based antennas are usually not housed, and therefore are subject towind forces.
These forces can bereduced byasmuch as50 per cent ifthe reflector isagrille (Figs.
9.14 and 9.28) oraperforated sheet (Fig.
9.13).
Fortunately such perforation does not impair the electrical performance ifthe holes arenot larger than about one-eighth wavelength inthe direction ofthe magnetic vector.
RADAR SCANNING PATTERNS We have seen that although afew radars have been designed with radiation beams that arefixed indirection, the great majority ofradar beams aremade toscan.
The motion ofthebeam maybe thought ofas the motion ofapoint onasphere that iscentered atthe scanner.
The beam sweeps over acertain region onthesphere determined bytheopera- tional function ofthe radar; often itdoes soperiodically, and inaset geometrical pattern termed the “scan.” The great variety ofscans may bedivided into two categories, simple and complex.
Asimple scan isone SEC.
9.7] COMPLEX SCANS 281 inwhich the beam sweeps with but one degree offreedom, that is,it covers repeatedly one and thesame arconthesphere.
Aradar employ- ingasimple scan cantelltherange ofatarget and only one ofitsangular coordinates, e.g., azimuth.
Inacomplex scan the beam ranges over a certain solid angle, byvirtue ofpossessing two degrees offreedom.
A radar possessing acomplex scan can tellthelocation ofatarget inspace bygiving the range and two angular coordinates, e.g., elevation and azimuth.
9.6.
Simple Scans.—One ofthe simple scans incommon use isthe circular (or“horizon,” or“all around looking, ”or“360”,” or“A”) scan; thebeam travels continuously around thehorizon, ormay beadjusted to scanaround atany constant angle above orbelow the horizontal.
This scan iswidely used inradars providing surface-based surveillance ofland, vessels, and distant aircraft; and itisused (see Fig.
9.6) inairborne radar, serving, forinstance, asanaidtoairnavigation.
Incertain scanners thebeam can beadjusted toaposition above orbelow thehorizon atthe will ofthe operator.
The scan rate isusually inthe range between 4 rpm forlarge scanners and 30rpm forsmall.
Sector (or“B”) scan isa modification ofcircular scan inwhich the beam scans toand froonan arc.
This motion iscommon incertain airborne radars forsurface search.
The sector istypically 75°wide, and 1to-and-fro cycle may occupy 1sec.
The third simple motion ofthe beam isconical scan, inwhich the path described onthe sphere isacircle ofavery few degrees diameter.
This scan isnot used forsearch, but finds wide useinaccurate tracking ofan individual target (see Sec.
6.14).
The diameter ofthe circle described bythe center ofthe beam ischosen with this application inmind; itis commonly such that the intensity radiated tothe center ofthe circle is somewhat greater than half thepeak intensity.
The scan rate isusuallY atleast 1200 rpm.
9.7.
Complex Scans.—A radar having spiral scan was used insingle- seat nightfighter aircraft during World War II.
This complex scan may bedescribed asaconical scan inwhich theangular diameter ofthecircle described bythebeam iscontinuously varied from 0°toamaximum of, forexample, 60°and back toOO.
Bythis motion thesolid angle covered isscanned completely in,say, 1secasthe beam spirals out\vard.
Ahelically scanning radar was used innightfighters that carried a radar operator inaddition tothe pilot.
The beam revolves rapid]y around avertical axis, asinhorizon scan, while the elevation angle is made tooscillate much more slowly between limits afew degrees above and below thehorizon.
Inthis way targets may besought within ahori- zontal 360° zone except for~vhatever blanking iscaused bythestructure ofthe nightfighter itself.
The time required toexplore this zone is approximately 3sec.
Amarriage ofthe horizon scan(or,alternatively, the sector scan) 282 ANTENNAS, SCANNERS, ANDSTABILIZATION [SEC.
98 with the conical scan produces the Palmer scan, the cycloidal motion of thebeam which results when aconical scanner slowly traverses thehori- zon.
The region ofsearch isahorizontal rectangle with semicircular ends.
Palmer scan was used toaccomplish aneasy transition from the search function tothe gunlaying function ofafire-control radar.
The name derives from afamiliar exercise inthePalmer system ofcalligraphy.
Other complex scans have been used mainly inexperimental equip- ment, Probably themost useful ofthese isascan inwhich theelevation (orazimuth) angle oscillates rapidly while the azimuth (orelevation) angle oscillates slowly.
MECHANICAL SCANNERS Inmost cases theentire radar antenna isput through certain angular motions inorder tomake thebeam scan.
The antenna assembly, includ- ingthemount that supports itand makes itmove, iscalled a”mechanical seamer.
”The t6rm “electrical scanner” isreserved forcases where the beam ismoved notbyamotion oftheantenna asawhole, but rather by relatively subtle motions ofthefeed orother parts oftheantenna.
The borderline between mechanical and electrical scanning isnotwell defined.
For instance, indenial ofthe foregoing definitions, the mechanical category includes the conical scans that aremechanized bythe circular motion ofapoint feed around thefocus ofafixed paraboloid.
Anelectri- calscan isfrequently used toproduce arapid sector scan ofsmall angular amplitude.
9“8.
The Kinematics ofMechanical Scanners.-The intended use of aradar fixes the type ofscan, and the type ofscan fixes inturn the kinematic aspects ofthe scanner design.
Acircular scan ismechanized bysimply revolving the antenna onahorizontal turntable.
Ifitis desired toraise orlower the beam, theturntable must carry bearings so that theantenna may betilted about ahorizontal axis atright angles to thebeam; thescanner may bedes~ribed asatilting antenna onarotating assembly onafixed base.
Airborne scanners ofthis type are usually mounted ontheunder side ofthefuselage, theantenna being below the pedestal.
Sector scanners arecinematically similar tocircular scanners.
Toenable the radar operator tocontrol theantenna from adistance the tilting isusually actuated byamotor.
This motor may belocated ontheturntable (inwhich case itmust bepowered through slip rings) or else onthebase (inwhich case aspecial mechanism must beprovided for transferring the mechanical power from the tilt motor tothe revolving antenna).
Both methods areused inpractice although only theformer isencountered insurface radars.
Conical scan may beeffected byspinning theantenna about anaxis not quite parallel tothebeam (AX/APS-6, Fig.
9.17); orbyspinning the SEC.
9.10] R-F TRAA’SMISS1O.V LIVES 283 paraboloid about anaxis passing through thefeed, theparaboloid being a fewdegrees “drunk” inrelation tothis axis (A>-/APG-15); orbyspinning anelectrically asymmetrical feed about the axis ofthe fixed paraboloid (SCR-584, Fig.
9.13).
Allthese methods and others areinwide use.
Ofthe complex motions, the spiral scan has been mentioned as derived from conical scan, and more particularly from three varieties just listed.
This isexemplified inthe first two cases bythe Navy’s AX/APS-6 nightfighter radar and the British AIMark VIII.
Helical scan isused inthe SCR-720 Army AIradar and inthe SCR-584 anti- aircraft set.
Inthe latter aconical scan issuperimposed sothat the result isasort ofhelical Palmer scan.
9.9.
The Weight ofMechanical Scanners.-The design ofamechanic- alscanner islargely dependent onitsantenna.
Although only asmall percentage ofthe scanner \veight isattributable tothe antenna, alarge antenna necessitates aheavy scanner.
Airborne scanners show this relation very strongly.
Asurvey ofweights’ indicates that, very roughly, the weight ofscanners having simple scans isgiven by0.09D2 pounds, where Distheparaboloid diameter ininches.
The formula forcomplex scans isO.13D’.
The survey shows that among airborne radars with mechanical scanners the scanner weighs 13to106 lb,representing from 6to21percent oftheweight oftheset, with anaverage ofabout 14per cent.
Surface-based scanners areingeneral larger than airborne scan- ners.
The weight runs from 75to5500 lbinshipborne antenna mounts, and ashigh as28,000 lbforland-based.
The antenna mounts ofsurface- based radars represent 10to40percent ofthetotal weight oftheset.
9.10.
R-f Transmission Lines .-The r-fenergy generated atthe transmitter isradiated bytheantenna, and theecho isledback from the same antenna tothemixer.
The same transmission line’ isused forboth thetransmitted and thereceived energy.
Arotary joint must beinserted inthe line whenever more than afew degrees ofrotation ofanantenna are required.
Such ajoint isalways installed with itsaxis coinciding with the axis ofthe corresponding degree offreedom.
Pressurization of the rotary joints, when necessary, isaccomplished, either bymeans ofa composition rubber ring.
revolving snugly around apolished steel tube, or bymeans ofapolished carbon ring revolving incontact with apolished steel annulus.
Helical scanners have atleast two rotary joints, i.e..
forazimuth and elevation, ashave spiral scanners.
9.11.
Data Transmission .-The continuous transmission ofinforma- tion from thescanner totheindicator, giving theattitude oftheantenna inrelation toitsbase, isknown as‘fdata transmission.

9.12 data are transmitted asvoltages induced insynchros.’ There is,for instance, asynchro generator built into theAN/APQ- 13scanner shown inFig.
9.8which revolves 10times foreach azimuth revolution ofthe antenna; asynchro motor inthe indicator imitates the motion ofthe generator, and through agear reduction rotates the deflection coils of thePPI insynchronism with theantenna.
Occasionally apotentiometer orasine-wave generator isused asthe data-transmitting element.
A similar type ofdata transmission isrequired ofservo-controlled scanners: avoltage from thetransmitting element iscompared with avoltage from the knob, etc., that istocontrol the antenna, and the antenna isauto- matically driven inthe direction which will bring the error signal or difference voltage tozero.
9.12.
Examples ofMechanical Scanners.-The above generalities will bemade more concrete inthe description ofafew specific scanners.
These arechosen toillustrate avariety ofpurposes, shapes, and sizes.
The SCR-584.—The antenna mount ofthe SCR-584 (Fig.
9.13) has been cited asaPalmer scanner, inasmuch asitcombines helical with conical scan.
The prime function ofthis radar,2 located inatrailer, is tolocate enemy aircraft and toprovide anantiaircraft director with data onslant range, azimuth, and elevation angle ofaircraft.
The beam (at the 10-cm band, about 4°wide) isformed bya6-ft stamped paraboloid illuminated byanelectrically offset dipole.
This 120-lb reflector is perforated with 6400 half-inch holes toreduce weight and windage.
A gear train inthe base actuates the searching inazimuth at6rpm.
A similar gear train islocated behind the reflector and actuates the eleva- tion motion; the excursion inelevation iscovered once perminute.
To enable tracking, the electrically asymmetrical dipole feed spins at1800 rpm, thus scanning the beam conically; this has the incidental effect of gyrating theplane ofpolarization oftheenergy.
Five units, driven bya spring-loaded gear train, are provided forazimuth data transmission: four synchros, ofwhich one isgeared torotate at16-speed, and one potentiometer.
Asiscommon practice indata transmission, each take- offmay beindividually adjusted byloosening itsmounting clamps and rotating the stator case for proper angular setting inrelation tothe antenna.
After theeventual removal oftheSCR-584 radar toanew site, any necessary reorientation ofthe take-offs may beeffected byan ingenious ‘‘group adjustment” ofthe data gear train.
Units analogous toallbut one oftheazimuth synchros aregeared totheelevation mech- anism.
The phase oftheconical scan iscontinuously signaled bymeans IPotentiometers andsynchros arediscussed inChaps.

The beam isthere- fore ofa“beavertail” shape and since theradiation isatthe3-cm band, thebeam is2.3° wide inazimuth and 0.7° wide inelevation.
The polar- ization isvertical.
Inthe height-finding function the beam scans in elevation between 2°below and 23°above the horizontal atamanually controlled azimuth.
For search purposes the azimuth motion may be motor-driven at4°persee, either boxing thecompass orscanning asector.
This azimuth rate cannot beexceeded ifsuccessive sweeps inelevation are tocover without gaps allportions ofthe zone being scanned.
The “oscillating beavertail” scan which results is,however, rather slow for search, and this function issometimes relegated toanother setwith which theAN/TPS-10 may form ateam.
The main bearing ofthe mount isaroller-ring bearing, defining the vertical axis ofthepedestal.

● Long-RangeGround Radar.
The system now tobedescribed was designed formicrowave early warning and surveillance ofenemy aircraft and the control offriendly aircraft.
Two antennas (Fig.
9.15), usually back-to-back onasingle mount, characterize this set.
One isforlong- range low-angle coverage and the other, radiating afan beam, covers higher elevations.
The setcan detect single heavy bombers toabove 30,000-ft altitude and 200-mile range, provided theaircraft areabove the horizon.
The antennas aresimilar inthat each has ashaped cylindrical reflector 25ftlong, in11sections, fedbyalinear array ofdipoles atthe10- cmband and forming abeam 0.9° wide inazimuth.
The waveguide trans- mission line isweatherproof, thearray being housed inaPlexiglas cover.
The antennas aredifferent inthat thelow-angle reflector is8fthigh and parabolic invertical section, itsradiation vertically polarized; whereas thehigh-angle reflector is5fthigh, ofanempirically determined shape producing anapproximately cosecant-squared beam, and itsradiation horizontally polarized.
The reflectors arenotperforated forthereason that thesmall amount 288 ANTENNAS, SCANNERS, AND STABILIZATION [SEC.

Asolidconstruction is therefore typical ofshaped cylindrical reflectors.
Paraboloid reflectors need notbesolid, since theradiation leaking through them from thepoint antenna feed isnotfocused and cannot cause sharply defined false echoes.
The antennas rotate about a\crtical axis at2or4rpm, together with their respective transmitters and common modulator.

Adifficult problem indynamic balance ispresented bythis scanner.
The difficulty arises from the fact that the fast (1200-rpm) rotor must beingood balance forallattitudes ofthe antenna which issupported thereon.
Inorder toeffect balance aspecial procedure hasbeen evolved whereby the correct number ofstandard lead weights may beattached toeach ofeighteen points provided ontheantenna and the main shaft.
Aspecial type ofbalancing machine has becm produced forthis purpose.

The AN/APQ-7 (Eagle) Scanner.-The AN/APQ-7 (Eagle) high-resolution navigation and bombing equipment was developed at Radiation Laboratory; Bell Telephone Laboratories carried through the production engineering.
I The antenna developed forthis equipment produces atthe3-cm band ahorizontally polarized beam ofradiation which has awidth of0.4° to 0.5° inazimuth and isshaped inelevation togive anapproximately cosecant-squared coverage down to70°angle ofdepression.
The beam scans a60°azimuth sector in~see, or1to-and-fro cycle inl+sec.
The range ofthe Eagle system forground-mapping isabout 50miles.
The antenna isaslender linear array 16ftlong, which fits into a streamlined housing (vane) hung laterally beneath theaircraft that uses it(Fig.
9.18).
The body ofthe array consists ofafixed 16-ft extruded aluminum channel and amovable 16-ft aluminum plate which together form aguide ofvariable width (Fig.

Let usassume that the energy ispropagated inthe wave- guide from left toright.

The chokes shown inthe channel and inthe plate serve toprevent leakage from the varying guide sothat the loss due both tothe finite conductivity ofthe waveguide and tothe leakage past the long choke iskept down toabout ~db/m during most ofthe scan.
Although the wavelength intheguide isnearly that which would beindicated bythea dimension, small corrections must beallowed forthe chokes and forany variation ofthe clearance between the channel and the plate atthe chokes.
Forthis reason thebdimension ismaintained toaclose tolerance bymeans ofrollers constraining the movable plate (Fig.

The spacing between the centers ofadjacent dipoles is one-half the guide wavelength when the guide is1.200 in.wide.
There- fore ineach adjacent pair thedipoles areexcited inphase opposition; but because ofthereversal ofoneofthem they radiate inphase, producing a broadside beam.

Atthe middle ofthe60°scan thevane isflipped within0.05 secinto itsother 45°position and the energy flow inthe array is reversed.
Ofthe many significant facts that have emerged inthe study ofthe prop- erties ofthe Eagle array, two areworth emphasizing.
One isthat practically all defects inthe azimuth pattern ofsuch along array arecaused byphase errors and not bydepartures from thedesired partition ofenergy among the dipoles; theother isthat random phase errors over lengths corresponding toafewdipoles are negligible when compared tosystematic phasing errors.

Although one parabolic bend CC would serve to collimate the primmy radiation and provide asharp beam onaxis, two bends may besodesigned astocorrect forcoma and thus give agood beam offaxis aswell.

Ingeneral itcan besaid that antennas ofthearray type (Eagle and LRASV) are compact but that the beam position depends onthe fre- quency, while antennas ofthe parallel-plate type (for instance, Schwarz- schiid, SCI) have abeam position independent offrequent ybut have more bulk and weight.
Thus, thearray has found useinairborne work and mobile equipment, while the others tend tobeused inground and ship equipments.
THE STABILIZATION PROBLEM Airplanes and ocean vessels areunsteady bases from which tomake observations byradar orbyany other means.
Ithas been necessary to SEC, 9.17] STABILIZATION OFTHEBEAM 305 devise means ofcompensating forthe angular motions ofsuch vehicles, and this mactice isknown asstabilization.’ The techniaue falls into two broad divisions, depending onwhether the beam ofradiation is stabilized, orthe data displayed onthe indicator arestabilized orcor- rected forthedistortions caused byatilting vehicle.
Ingeneral there isnochoice between the two types ofstabilization.
Ifthevehicle rolls orpitches tosuch anextent that itssearch radar no longer scans the desired part ofthe field ofview, beam stabilization is necessary.
This will prevent targets from fading from the indicator; if they arethen indicated, but atafalse position, data stabilization becomes aconcurrent need.
Ifthe vehicle momentarily changes heading (yaws) while onacertain course, therelative azimuth oftargets will momentarily aher;theconsequent aberration ofthedisplay can be,and hasbeen, cor- rected by either type ofstabilization.
Either sort ofstabilization requires thevehicle tocarry gyroscopes orother devices which aresensi- tive todirection inspace and “know” the direction ofnorth orup.
There are several ways ofmore orless completely mechanizing the stabilization ofthe beam.
The most obvious and perhaps the most elegant istoprovide astable base forthescanner.
This may beaplat- form mounted ongimbals and controlled automatically tocompensate the pitching and rolling ofthe vehicle.
Ifthe vehicle rolls much but pitches little, thepitch-gimbal axis may beomitted, and the stable-base stabilization degenerates into roll stabilization.
Avery different method ofbeam stabilization ispossible inascanner having itsmain axis always perpendicular tothe floor ofthe vehicle.
Use ismade ofthetiltaxis oftheantenna totheend that theantenna is automatically directed toward thehorizon, ortowhatever angle above or below thehorizon isdesired.
The line ofsight isthereby stabilized.

9.17 servoamplifier, and thefollow-up system which includes theservomotor, the gear train orlinkage system, and atake-off actuated bythe con- trolled member.
The gyro may bemounted onthe rotating scanner or remote from the scanner, using slip rings and resolvers totake offthe required error information.
The error isfedinto aservoamplifier whose output operates the servomotor which inturn aligns the antenna with thehorizontal through agear train orlinkage system.
The gyro should preferably have either atwo-speed erection mecha- nism oradevice todisconnect theerection mechanism when theaircraft goes into aturn.
Inaturn the gyro rotor tends toalign itself with the resultant ofthe true gravity and the centrifugal force caused bythe acceleration intheturn, instead ofwith true gravity alone.
This can be minimized oreliminated byusing atwo-speed erection mechanism, orby employing anelectromagnetic clutch tothrow out the erection system entirely inturns.
Continuing thegeneral classification previously referred to,stabilizers may befurther typed asstable-base, roll, orline-of-sight, depending on thestabilization compensation afforded.
The stable-base stabilizer, asthe name indicates, provides complete stabilization oftheplatform upon which theantenna ismounted.
This requires useofatwo-axis gyro transmitter toprovide alignment orerror information forboth roll and pitch axes.
The gyro isusually mounted remotely from the antenna structure inthis type.
Inaddition two separate servoamplifiers and follow-up channels arerequired, one forthe roll-error component and one forthe pitch-error component.
Although this provides complete stabilization, theweight ofthecomponents usually appears excessive sothat another type ispreferable.
The roll stabilization referred toisstable-base stabilization with the pitch channel removed.
This requires asingle-axis gyro transmitter for the roll axis, and but one servoamplifier and follow-up channel.
Roll stabilization would beappropriate inlarge aircraft forwhich the pitch component might benegligible ortolerable.
Indeciding between aroll and aplatform stabilizer the accuracy requirements must bebalanced against theweight added bythepitch channel.
The line-oj-sight method isone which maintains theaxis ofthe beam ofradiation inahorizontal position orafixed angular distance above or below thehorizon asthe antenna rotates, scanning thehorizon.
This is done byautomatically tilting theantenna about anaxis perpendicular to theplane ofthebeam and parallel tothefloor oftheaircraft.

Asynchro isalso located at theoutput crankshaft ofthetorque unit.
The servoamplifier essentially amplifies the algebraic difference between the voltages from these take- offs, and thus actuates themotor inthetorque unit toassure alignment between theoutput shaft and thegyro.
The output shaft islinked tothe paraboloid support byarodseen atthebottom ofFig.

When there 308 ANTENNAS, SCANNERS, AND STABILIZATION [SEC.

Because the gyro ismounted onthe scanner, itisliable to the precession caused bythe inertia ofthe supporting gimbal system.
Under some conditions this precession causes thegyro toindicate afalse vertical, thus producing serious errors inthestabilization system.
Although inthe above example the gyro ismounted onthe rotating yoke, the effects ofprecession are avoided inthe most recent designs bymounting the gyro ontheairframe and providing atake-off oneach gimbal axis.
Avoltage indicating the correct tilt angle isfed tothe servoamplifier.
Aspecial rotary inductor mounted onthe scanner base provides this voltage, which itcomputes asafunction ofthe antenna relative azimuth and theroll and pitch voltages from the gyro.
Aspreviously discussed, the purpose ofantenna stabilization isto preserve range performance byassuring constant illumination innon- level flight asinlevel flight.
Inconsidering the accuracy requirements various factors must becompared, such asbeam shape and operational use contemplated forthe radar.
Ifapencil beam moves upordown because ofmaneuvers ofthe aircraft orpoor stabilization, the scope signal will fade.
Quantitatively, ifabeam moves upordown byone-half itsbeamwidth, itcan beshown that thesetwill suffer arange reduction of29percent.
The range will bereduced 10percent ifthebeam varies from the stabilized position by0.28 beamwidth and by5percent ifthe beam varies 0.19 beamwidth.
Asarange reduction of10per cent is considered themaximum allowable, itcan beseen that thebeam must be stabilized sothat itremains within 0.28 beamwidt hofacompletely stabilized position.
The adequacy ofthe above calculations has been verified byrough observations inflight.
Beam stabilization incurrent airborne navigation radars should beaccurate within about t1.3°, depending ontheset, lest range performance suffer noticeably.
Inpractice itisquite difficult torealize stabilization accuracies high enough tosatisfy theforegoing tolerances forthevarious types ofbeams and radars.
This isprincipally due totheearly stage ofairborne stabili- zation development and the stringent weight requirements onairborne gyroscopes.
Current developments should lead tomore highly accurate lightweight airborne antenna stabilization.
The present static accuracy ofairborne gyros ranges from +#to+#.
However, errors offrom 1°to5°may occur ifthe erection mechanism isnot cut offinaturn.
This error isafunction oftheduration oftheturn.

Inshipborne radar ithasbecome evident that forcertain applications athird axis should beadded toensure atrue and undistorted display ofthe radar signals.
The nature ofthese dis- tortions will beclear from the following considerations.
When aship and itstwo-axis antenna mount arerolled totheright and theelevation axis momentarily setathwartship sothat theantenna islooking for- ward, iftheelevation angle ofthe beam isvaried thebeam thereupon describes onthe sky the arcofa great circle which isnot vertical but which isinclined toward the right.
All airplanes detected on this arc will beindicated asdead ahead, since the train axis isori- ented tothis position.
This indi- cation isofcourse false, and the two-axis mount therefore imper- fect inprinciple.
The computer described below provides correction fordistortion ofthis type.
Such correction is,z M FIG.9.36.—Deck-tilt error.

however, inapplicable ifthe radiation isavertically fanned beam ora pencil beam which must oscillate rapidly inavertical plane.
The inadequacy oftwo-axis ship antenna mounts forcertain applica- tions can becorrected bytheaddition ofathird degree offreedom, cor- responding tothe cross-level axis.
This axis issupported bythe train axis and issetparallel tothedeck; theelevation axis ismounted onitata right angle.
Bymeans ofthis new degree offreedom aservomechanism holds theelevation axis level inrespect tothehorizon.
The axes ofthis three-axis mount arecommonly designated asthe “train,” “cross-level,” and “level” axes.
Amount ofthis type affords freedom from the dis- tortion ofthe dkplay occurring when atwo-axis mount isused.
Ithas theadded virtue that itcan follow moving targets above 45°, which with atwo-axis mount would require impracticably great servo rates.
Weight considerations have prevented the development ofthree-axis scanners forairborne use.
We have mentioned adistortion inthe display ofanelevated target observed from arocking ship.
Aclosely related distortion inbearing is present even forsurface targets: the deck-tilt error.
Itsorigin ismade clear byanexample, Fig.
9.36, which represents aship heading north toward the reader, listing tostarboard.
The circle represents alarge 310 ANTENNAS, SCANNERS, AA’D STABILIZATION [SEC.

Iftheantenna isnotstabilized, itspencil beam will atsome instant bedirected toward Abelow thehorizon.
The indicator will then show anangle measured bythearcHA.Ifthe beam isstabi- lized byatwo-axis mount, itwill atthat instant beatthepoint Bwhere the great circle AMintersects the horizon; since HBexceeds HAthe indicator will report the position ofthe beam falsely.
Ifthe beam is stabilized byathree-axis mount, itwill bedirected toward C;theindica- tion isagain false since HCisless than HA.Thus either ofthese types ofstabilization results inadistortion ofthe bearing oftargets onthe horizon.
Arecent successful device forthe stabilization ofshipborne antennas includes computers and anassociated gyroscope, and islocated wi‘~inthe ship.
The principal components ofthe stable vertical gyroscope area gimbal system sosupported that the outer and inner gimbal rings tilt respectively about the roll and pitch axes ofthe ship, asecond gimbal system supported byand within the first, and the gyroscope wheel sup- ported inthe second gimbal system.
The wheel axis seeks the vertical because ofapendulous magnet carried byathird gimbal system, and compensation isprovided inthegyroscope fortheeffect ofship’s turns or changes ofspeed.
The second gimbal system isheld parallel tothe plane ofthe gyro wheel, that is,horizontal, bymeans ofaservomechanism; and from this gimbal system two push-rods extend upward and provide roll and pitch inputs tothe mechanical computer located immediately over the gyro unit.
The force tomove these rods isprovided bythe servomechanism rather than bythegyro itself.

Aswehave seen, itisone ofthe functions ofthe computer toprovide the deck-tilt correction.
This computation iseasily mechanized, because the deck-tilt error is mathematically similar tothe error intransmitting angular motion through auniversal joint.
The gyroscopes used inshipborne antenna stabilization areaccurate towithin 2’to7’;theerror seems tobeafunction oftheroll, pitch, and heading ofthe vessel.
The large synchros used inthis work areliable toerrbyabout 10’to30’.
Itfollows that agood shipborne equipment, using synchros geared ashigh as36to1forincreased accuracy, holds the beam with anaverage error ofaslittle as5’,although momentary errors ofmore than twice this magnitude may alise.

Data Stab~zation.
‘—It has been remarked that even after the mechanical engineer hasprovided astabilized antenna mount and thereby ensured that theradar will correctly perform itsscanning function despite rolling orpitching ofthevehicle, theindicator may still display theposi- tion oftargets falsely.
Weareconcerned inthis section with theproblem ofimproving theindicator inthis respect.
The older PPI radars, both airborne and shipborne, were designed to display targets attheir bearings relative tothe heading ofthe vehicle.
More recent design allows adisplay oftargets intheir true bearings, that is,with north atthe top ofthe screen regardless ofheading.
The rela- tive-bearing indication isbad for two reasons: (1)the entire display rotates and becomes confused ifthe course ofthe vehicle isaltered; (2) the natural random changes inthe heading ofthe vehicle cause acor- responding blurring ofthe display onthe persistent screen.
The true- bearing indication isfree ofthese faults.
Itisadata stabilization in regard toyawand changes ofheading.
Yaw stabilization isimplemented with the aidofahorizontal gyro- scope which iskept pointing north bymanual orautomatic reference to theearth’s magnetic field.
Through amechanical orelectrical differen- tialthere isprovided attheindicator avoltage signifying thetrue bearing ofthe beam, that is,the difference between the relative bearing ofthe beam and the relative bearing ofthetrue north.
Deck-tilt error isserious inairborne aswell asinshipborne radar.
Let usimagine anairplane equipped with abombing radar having afan beam; thebase ofthe scanner isnot stabilized, and theantenna may or 1Sees.

Ifthis airplane banks, the relative bearing ofground targets will be,asweshall see, falsely indicated.
For example, letusconsider thecase ofanairplane banking foraright turn, the relative bearing ofthebeam being straight ahead.
Itisclear that since thefanisperpendicular tothefloor oftheairplane itisnot atthe moment vertical, and that therefore thetargets onthe straight line on the ground now being illuminated bythebeam arenot atzero bearing.
Since such targets arenevertheless displayed asifatzero bearing, the display isdistorted; these targets areshifted byanamount equal tothe altitude ofthe airplane multiplied bythe tangent ofthe bank angle.
Other targets areless seriously disturbed, those at90° and 270° being correctly indicated onabanking airplane.
Two methods have been considered forcorrecting theairborne deck- tilterror.
One method issotostabilize theantenna that theplane ofthe fanbeam remains indeed vertical.
This can beaccomplished bystable- base stabilization orbyathree-axis mount.
The other method isby data stabilization, and several circuits have been devised forremoving thedistortion ifsupplied with voltages depending ontheangles involved.
None ofthese circuits hasbeen incorporated insystems now inwide use, although one radar designed forproduction incorporates afeature that accurately corrects thedisplay attheonetarget designated astheaiming point.

Installation ofAirborne Scanners.-In discussing antenna installations wewill treat first theairborne case.
Here, one ofthepress- ingproblems isthechoice oflocation.
The radar must have theunob- structed “vision” required foritsoperation, and itsantenna should beso installed that itmay behoused inanaerodynamically acceptable radome.
Avery common requirement iscircular vision oftheground well out toward thehorizon, asinFig.
9%.
The only good location isthen below thefuselage.
Ifrearward vision isnotrequired, anantenna with circular scan canbemounted just behind and below thenose oftheairplane, where theradome can becompletely faircd in.
Scanning ofonly aforward sector ispossible iftheantenna ismounted inthenose.
Such alocation isimpossible insingle-engine airplanes, and external housing becomes necessary.
Aerodynamically, perhaps the best site inthis category isatawing tip, although ablister faired into a leading edge has been widely used.
For maintenance reasons easy replacement ofthe setisdesirable; this has been accomplished inone instance bypackaging thegreater part ofthesetina“bomb” suspended under one wing.
Inthe aircraft-interception radar ofnightfighters the scanner islocated forvision inallgenerally forward directions.
Such scanners can bemounted inany ofthelocations that aregood forsector scanners.
Bomber-borne scanners forprotective firecontrol arelocated SEC.
920]INSTALLATION OFSURFACE-BASED SCANNERS 313 where they can search forand track enemy fighters approaching from the rear orother anticipated directions, orarelocated ontheturret guns.
Animportant question inmounting ascanner inthebelly ofanair- plane is‘‘How farshall theantenna protrude below thekeel line?“ Too great aprotrusion will add tothe aerodynamic drag, whereas ifthe antenna isretracted toofarthevision isinadequate innearly horizontal dh-ections because ofpartial blocking ofthefield ofradiation.
The ray diagram ofthe radiation field isnot asufficient guide inplanning an antenna installation.

with the antenna installed inamockup.
1Such measurements have shown that some circularly scanning fan-beam antennas may beso installed that nearly half their height isabove thekeel line oftheairplane, and this conclusion has been confirmed inobservation oftheindicator in flight.
Figure 9.37 shows qualitatively why such aninstallation ispossi- blewith thetype ofscanner shown inFig.
9.8.
Inattaching thescanner totheairframe itisnotnecessary oradvisable touseshock mounts unless electronic equipment isinseparably attached tothe scanner.
Itisfrequently essential, however, toprovide adjust- ments foraccurately orienting the scanner base.
Toallow this adjust- ment itiscustomary that the short length oftransmission line between thescanner and ther-funit beflexible: this flexibility yalso allows ther-f unit tobeshock-mounted.
9.20.
Installation ofSurface-based Scanners.-The installation of scanners onshipboard presents asiting problem slightly simpler than in theairborne case.
Itisnecessary toavoid locations where thestructure ofthe ship will blank the radiation orproduce spurious reflections.
Sometimes itbecomes necessary toinstall two scanners, each ofwhich covers theregion inwhich theother isblind.
When aship hasmore than one radar onagiven wavelen~h, one can t‘jam” the other, filling its screen with spurious indications; this effect can bemitigated byproper siting ofthescanners and byblanking thereceiver ofeach attheinstant 1Arecent installation isdescribed byW.11.Cady inRLReport NTO.848, “The AN/APQ-13 (60-in.

Onaccount ofthe curvature ofthe earth and forreasons ofmicrowave propagation itisusually advantageous that thescanner beinstalled ashigh aspossible.
Radomes arenotwidely used tohouse shipboard scanners, the tendency being tomake the antennas ofsuch low wind resistance and such sturdy construction asto render radomes unnecessary.
Ground-based radars may begrouped, according totheir mobility, astransportable, mobile, and fixed.
Because thetransportable scanners are disassembled for moving, their installation requirements include easy assembly.

Afirm and adjust able footingmust beincorporated fortransportable scanners.
Atruck ortrailer onwhich ascanner ismounted must also befirmly braced while the radar isinuse; the scanner itself must beadjustably mounted tothevehicle, ifaccurate position-finding isdesired.
The siting ofground-based scanners istoberegarded asanaspect of theinstallation problem.
Asuitable sitemust beonewhere nomountain seriously blocks offtheregion beyond.
Amore subtle siting requirement istheavoidance ofground “clutter”; permanent echoes arebothersome atcertain sites, particularly iftheradar targets frequently pass atnearly thesame range and direction assuch echoes.
Moving-target indication, dkcussed inChap.
16,isnow practicable toalleviate ground clutter.
9.21.
Radomes.1-It isnecessary toprotect allairborne and some surface-based microwave antennas from wind and weather.
The pro- tective housings have come tobeknown as‘‘radomes.” Afuller discus- sion than thefollowing will befound inVol.
26ofthis series.
The circular cylinder shape was early used fortheradome.
For such ashape theradiation falls ontheradome essentially atnormal incidence, the angle ofincidence being defined asthe angle between the incident radiation and thenormal tothesurface atthepoint ofincidence.
The development ofmicrowave airborne radar systems forced the development ofthe science and art ofradome design.
Itresulted in amplification oftheelectrical theory forradomes through which theradar beam passes athigh angles ofincidence.
Plywood, first used forradome construction, gave way tomore satisfactory synthetic materials; and aerodynamics, atfirst ignored, was given consideration inthe design.
Excellent installations arepossible iftheradar systems areconsidered in theinitial design studies ofaircraft.
Since the airborne radome involves allthe problems ofthe surface- based installation inaddition tomany others peculiar toitself, this discussion will belimited totheairborne case.
Some ofthefactors con- trolling the design ofanairborne radome arethe radar antenna and its 1Ssca 9,21-9.25 byF.J.Mehringer. SEC.
922] STREA MLIA”ING 315 function, radome materials, transmission ofradar energy, structural requirements, aerodynamics, access tothe radome cavity, and specifica- tion and test.
Inthis discussion only the three major items—aerodynamics, elec- trical transmission, and structural design—will bediscussed, and these only briefly.
N’one ofthese items can take preeminence over the others since adesign aerodynamically orstructurally poor can prevent theradar setfrom being useful, just aswould aradome that had faulty transmission characteristics.
The radome design must, therefore, beacompromise ofthese three major factors ifaccuracy and effectiveness oftheairborne unit aretobesecured.
9.22.
Streamlining.
-There isnosimple foolproof answer tothe aerodynamical problem.
Each installation has peculiarities ofitsown, depending upon itslocation ontheairplane inquestion, the plane itself, the speed ofthe plane, and the size and shape ofthe radome.
Afew simple considerations can besetforth but thereal answer can only result from careful test inawind tunnel.
Although, from anelectrical viewpoint, the circular cylinder isthe most desirable shape foraradome, aerodynamically itisobjectionable due toitshigh drag.
Bystreamlining acylinder itsairresistance can be reduced toasixth orless.
Any radome extending beyond the fuselage line ofthe airplane should therefore bestreamlined.
The drag foraprotuberance ofgiven shape increases inapproximate proportion toitsfrontal area.
Itistherefore desirable toreduce the projected area ofthe radome asmuch aspossible even tothe extent of having the radome surface coincide with the skin oftheplane.
Ifaprotuberance isnecessary, thedrag can beminimized bylocating theradome ataposition where there isalready some disturbance ofthe airflow.
The turbulence oftheairstream tends tobeamaximum toward thetail ofthe plane.
R’bile practically noprotuberance ispermissible near thenose ofahigh-speed airplane, one etiending several inches amid- ship orfurther aftmay cause ahardly noticeable increase ofdrag.
The truly satisfactory design, however, can beverified only bytests inthe wind tunnel where very slight differences inaircraft performance arereadily detectable.
The wind-tunnel test can also beused tofurnish pressure distributions ontheradome surface, which arenecessary forthe structural design computations.
The location oftheantenna ontheairplane must also betheresult of operational requirements and compromises with the other components.
For navigation and bombing itisdesirable tohave theantenna scan 360° inazimuth.
This can best berealized inalocation onthe belly ofthe -e about midship, but generally only byadding alarge protuberance.
Alocation inthe “chin” ofthe airplane offers amore favorable location 316 ANTENNAS, SCANNERS, ANDSTABILIZATION [SEC.
923 sofarasthe aerodynamics isconcerned, but limits the rearward view.
This space, too, isdesirable forthelocation ofcertain crew members and ofthebombsight.
Interference with other installations isusually less in anaftlocation, but the space isoften limited bythe size ofthe fuselage atthis point and theforward view may becutoffbytheforward portion ofthe plane.
9.23.
Electrical Transmission.-The ultimate shape ofthe radome is generally limited byelectrical design considerations.
The retraction of the antenna iscontrolled byedge interference, foranedge can cause blanking and diffraction ofaradar beam.
The result isadistortion and deterioration ofthe antenna pattern.
Any discontinuity such asthat caused byreinforcement oftheradome orbyapiece ofmetal may cause diffraction ifitintercepts theradar beam.
The permissible range ofincident angle isthe other electrical factor limiting the shape ofthe radome.
The range ofsatisfactory incident radiation transmission varies with different materials and radome wall constructions.
The properties ofthematerials affecting thetransmission arethe dielectric constant and the loss tangent; thelatter isanindex of theabsorption and theformer isafactor determining thereflection.
For optimum combinations todate, satisfactory transmission can beobtained over arange of0°to70°.
Beyond this value thetransmission decreases very rapidly, reaching zero transmission at90°incidence.
Having determined areasonable shape fortheradome, itisthen neces- sary tocheck theangles ofincidence bymeans ofanantenna raydiagram.
Typical ray diagrams forcosecant-squared antennas are shown inFigs.
9.2, 9.10, and 9“37.
Ifthe antenna isstabilized, the angles will have to bechecked throughout the range ofstabilization.
When the angles of incidence exceed the limiting value the contours ofthe radome must be adjusted until theupper limit ofangle ofincidence isnot exceeded.
9.24.
Structural Design ofRadomes.—The thickness and construc- tion oftheradome wall can bedetermined onthebasis ofstructural con- siderations within limits depending upon the allowable reflection.
The reflection isacyclic function depending upon the dielectric constants, thickness ofthe material, and angles ofincidence ofthe radiation.
There aretwo basic types ofconstruction: the single plastic orlami- nated wall, and the so-called “sandwich” construction involving two or more materials.
The sandwich construction consists ofhigh-strength skin surrounding acore oflower density, which results inahigh-strength, low-density construction.
The sandwich construction also provides a greater variety ofwall construction forhigh strength and efficient elec- trical transmission.
The approach tothe structural design problem will depend upon the shape ofthe radome and the pressure distribution.
These two factors SEC.
9.25] EXAMPLES OF RADOMES 317 will determine whether theproblem isone ofstrength orstability.
The stability problem isadifficult one tomeet, since noribs orother means ofreinforcement can beused forthe extensive transparent area because ofpossible distortion ofthe electrical pattern.
The design ofthemounting oftheradome should have due considera- tion.
Servicing requirements necessitate removal oftheradome.
The means ofmounting theradome must bequick-fastening aswell asstrong.

Examples ofRadomes.—Types ofradomes vary greatly insize, shape, and method ofconstruction.
Attention iscalled toafew repre- sentative radomes.
Figure 9.38 shows anearly type ofretractable airborne radome mounted onaB-29.
The radome isacylinder 3% in.indiameter and extending about 33in.when unretracted.
While the shape isideal electrically, itseffect onthespeed oftheaircraft ismost objectionable.
The leading edge ofthe Eagle vane (Fig.

While the airfoil section isinitself oflow drag, theattachment totheplane increases the drag until itisalmost ashigh asthat forthe cylindrical radome.
This increase indrag isdue totheinterference and stagnation points setupby mounting theairfoil totheplane.
Anadditional feature ofthis radome was that itwas designed tobedeiced bymeans ofhotair.
The optimum wall spacings forheat transfer and forelectrical transmission donot coincide, sothat deicing isnot very efficient.

G.WHITE THE MAGNETRON BY G.B.COLLINS Strenuous efforts were made bythe British, beginning about 1938, todevelop high-power pulsed sources ofradiation atvery high frequen- cies, because ofthe operational need formicrowave radar.
Two lines of attack were followed.
One consisted ofattempts toimprove and modify conventional types oftransmitting tubes, and the other ofefforts to devise entirely new forms oftransmitting tubes.
Modifying the conventional type oftransmitting tube tosatisfy the requirements ofradar met with difficulties.
Toafirst approximation theelectronic characteristics ofalow-frequency oscillator oramplifier are preserved athigh frequency only ifalldimensions ofthetube arescaled inproportion tothewavelength A;asaresult, itisnecessary toreduce the size oftubes asthe frequency isincreased.
The practical consequences ofthis become serious asfrequencies of1000 Me/see are approached.
The reduction ofcathode and plate areas, which under these conditions vary asA2,rapidly reduces theavailable peak emission and plate dissipa- tion.
Electrode clearances become sosmall that they are difficult to maintain accurately.
Although many improvements inthe design of triodes ortetrodes foruseatmicrowave frequencies have been made, the general limitations just outlined have resulted ingreatly reduced effi- ciency and power output inthe microwave region.
Fortunately, anew type ofpulsed microwave generator was invented whose performance was indeed spectacular.
These generators arenow known as‘‘microwave” or‘icavity” magnetrons, and they constitute the most important single contribution tomicrowave radar.
The description, method ofoperation, and characteristics ofthis type of magnetron arethe subject ofthe first part ofthis chapter.
Asasource ofhigh-power microwaves the multicavity magnetron represents avery great advance over both theconventional space-charge and the velocity-modulated orklystron-tube types.
Afew numerical comparisons will emphasize this superiority.
Above frequencies of 3000 Me/see, space-charge tubes such astriodes cease entirely tobe practical sources ofr-fpower, while magnetrons produce pulse powers 320 SEC.

The average power output ofmagnetrons at3000 .Mc/sec isin theneighborhood ofhundreds ofwatts, orone hundred times that ofa triode operating atthe same frequency.
Klystrons are.
very useful sources oflow c-w power atfrequencies ashigh as24,000 Me/see, but cannot beconsidered high-power pulsed sources.
Their pulse-power output ranges from afew hundred watts at3000 Me/see toafew milli- watts at24,000 Me/see.
Magnetrons areself-excited oscillators and their output does nothave the frequency stability possible atfrequencies where power amplifiers areavailable and theoutput frequency isestablished bycrystal-controlled oscillators.
When properly designed and used, they exhibit stability adequate tothe demands ofpulse radar.

Construction.-Microwave magnetrons, orcavity magnetrons asthey arefrequently called, arebasically self-excited oscillators whose purpose istoconvert thed-cinput power into r-foutput power.
Figures 10.1 and 10.2 show aparticular design ofa10-cm magnetron which is typical ofthk class oftransmitting tubes.
Between the cylindrical cathode Cand anode block Aisaninteraction space Iinwhich thecon- version ofd-ctor-fpower takes place.
Aconstant and nearly uniform magnetic field ismaintained inthis interaction space inadirection parallel tothe axis ofthe tube.
Inoperation, the cathode ismaintained ata negative potential while the anode block isusually atground potential.
The anode block ispierced inadirection parallel totheaxis byanumber ofsidecavities Rwhich open into theinteraction space sothat theanode surface consists ofalternate segments and gaps.
The ends oftheresonat- ingcavities open into chambers which arecalled endspaces,through which the lines offlux extending from one resonator tothe next pass.
The coupling between the resonators isincreased (inthe design shown in Figs.
10.1 and 10”2) byconducting bars called strapsSwhich connect alternate segments.
Power isextracted from one resonator, one method being theuse ofacoupling loopLwhich forms apart ofthe output cir- cuit.
The combination ofresonant cavities, end spaces, straps, and out- put circuit iscalled theresonant system.
Amore detailed discussion ofthese parts ofamagnetron follows.
For pulsed operation, the cathode Cisusually oxide-coated and heated indirectly byaninternal heating coif oftungsten ormolybdenum.
The cathode structure isattached mechanically totwo cathode stems sup- ported byglass toprovide anode-to-cathode insulation.
Ateach end of thecathode there isanend shield, orhat H,whose purpose istoprevent electrons from leaving thecathode structure inadirection parallel tothe axis ofthemagnetron.
These end shields must bekept atatemperature toolow tocause theemission ofelectrons. 322 THEMAGNETRON ANDTHEPULSER [SEC.10.1 The dimensions oftheinteraction space depend upon thewavelength and voltage atwhich the magnetron istooperate and also upon the number ofresonant cavities, oroscillators.
The ratio ofcathode diam- eter to-anode diameter isdetermined principally bythe number of oscillators, nomatter what the wavelength oroperating voltage istobe.
For a12-oscillator magnetron the diameter ofthe cathode isabout one- c\ H s FIG.1O.1.—A typical ca},ity magnetron.
half the anode diameter.
For fewer oscillators, itissomewhat smaller than one-half, and formore than twelve oscillators, somewhat larger.
The anode and cathode diameters forany given type arepropofiional to thewavelength and tothe square root ofthe anode voltage.
The particular resonant system shown consists ofeight side cavities.
Each ofthese cavities issimilar toasimple oscillating circuit consisting ofalumped Land C.
Although the inductance and capacity ofthe magnetron cavity are not strictly lumped, the inductance ofthe oscil- SEC.

The dimensions ofthese cavities determine toalarge degree the oscillation frequency ofthe magnetron.
Since thefrequency isafunction oftheproduct LC,thesame frequency can beobtained from avariety ofshapes which have the 324 THE MAGNETRON AND THE PULSER [SEC.

The frequency ofthe magnetron isthus nearly that ofanindividual cavity.
The performance ofmagnetrons isnot very sensitive tothe impedance oftheoscillators, L/C,and awide variety ofoscillator configurations are possible.

These oscillator configurations were selected toillustrate some shapes that have been found convenient; the number ofpossibilities isunlimited.
Returning toFig.
10.1 itisseen that the side cavities open atboth ends into chambers, orend spaces.
These end spaces assist incoupling theseparate oscillators byallowing magnetic flux topass from one oscil- lator into the next.
The straps Sconsist ofrings which are connected only toalternate segments.
The connections are made insuch away that one setofalternate segments isconnected byastrap atone end of theanode, and theother setofsegments isconnected byacorrespondhg strap atthe other end ofthe anode.
Magnetrons may beeither single- ordouble- (oreven quadruple-) strapped, meaning they have either one ortwo (orfour) straps ateach end oftheanode.
Figures 10.3a, b,and c show magnetron anode blocks, without straps; Figs.

The majority ofexisting magnetrons areofthis type.
A variety ofother designs have been constructed, most ofwhich have not proved tobeassatisfactory asthe strapped type.
One type, however, has several marked advantages over strapped tubes.

Itisinteresting tonote that this ‘resonant system results in anoperating orr-mode which lies intermediate infrequency between other modes while, forstrapped tubes, the r-mode has the lowest fre- quency.
For very high powers, the rising-sun system has considerable promise.
Unlike strapped systems, the rising-sun system permits the anode tobemade with acircumference and alength which arenot small compared toawavelength without producing mode instabilities.
Thus even athigh frequencies large cathodes and large emissions arepossible.

Electron Orbits and the Space Charge.—An electron inthe interaction space ofamagnetron isacted onbyaconstant magnetic field parallel totheaxis ofthecathode, aconstant radial electric field resulting from the applied d-cpotential, and the varying electric field extending into theinteraction space from charges concentrated near theends ofthe SEC.

Aqualitative understanding insimple terms oftheprocesses responsible fortheexcitation ofthemagnetron is,however, possible.

The resulting motion isapproxi- mately represented bysuperposing aslow rotation around thecathode at nearly constant radius Ro(the ROrotation), and afaster circular motion with asmaller radius TO(the TOrotation).
The resultant ofthese two motions corresponds roughly tothemotion ofapoint onthecircumference ofawheel asitrolls around acircle somewhat smaller than the cathode insuch away that itscenter moves inacircle ofradius RO(Fig.

Although theangular velocity ofthisrO rotation isconstant, the magnitude ofTOdepends onthe initial kinetic energy of the electron and may vary fordifferent electrons.

Asomewhat unusual fact isthat those electrons which are speeded uphave their radius ofcurvature reduced and return tothecathode, while those which areslowed down have their radius ofcurvature increased and move out toward theanode.
Tomake this appear reasonable, letusconsider agreatly simplified case shown inFig.
10~12.
Anelectron moves through crossed, uniform electric and magnetic fields with avelocity vthat isnormal toEand H.
The directions ofv,E,and Haremade toagree with those acting onthe electron inFig.

The force equation is Hev~uz =eE+—,T R(1) where Ristheradius oftheorbit oftheelectron (Rispositive fororbits curving down).
Where the path ofthe electron isastraight line, the condition isobtained byletting R=~.Equation (1)then reduces to v=Et/H.
Inspection ofEq.

For v>Et/H,the deflection will beinthedirection ofthemagnetic force.
The deflection that anelectron suffers inthis example when speeded uporslowed down thus corresponds towhat happens inamagnetron and itissignificant that the operating conditions areones forwhich v=Et/H.
This example isgiven only to illustrate the complex electronics ofthese tubes and isobviously inac- curate when applied toamagnetron because theelectric field isnot uni- form but has cylindrical symmetry and isfurther deformed byspace SEC.103] ELECTRON ORBITS AND THE SPACE CHARGE 333 charge.
The fields inamagnetron, however, are certainly such asto produce this separation offast and slow electrons.
The problem isshown inmore detail inFig.
10.13.
Consider an electron atpoint Aattheinstant forwhich thefields areasshown.
The r-ffield atthis point tends tospeed Up theelectron.
Asitspeeds up,the radius ofcurvature ofitspath isdecreased, and itwill move along apath corresponding tothe solid line and strike the cathode with appreciable energy.
This electron isthus removed from thespace charge, and plays nofurther role intheprocess except perhaps toproduce afew secondary electrons from the cathode.
Anelectron atpoint 1?,however, isina decelerating r-felectric field.
ASaresult ofthe reduction inelectron velocity, the radius ofcurvature ofitspath isincreased.
Ifthe fre- quency ofoscillation isappropriate, this electron will always beina decelerating field asitpasses before successive anode segments.
The result isthat theelectron, following apath ofthetype shown, eventually strikes the anode.
Because ofretardation bythe r-ffield, the electron gives uptother-ffield theenergy gained initsfallthrough thed-cfield totheanode.
Since the electron moves from the cathode tothe anode inavery small number ofoscillations, the condition that the electron keep step, 334 THE MAGNETRON AND THE PULSER [SEC.
10.3 initscourse around the cathode, with the variations ofr-foscillations need not besatisfied exactly.
Electrons once instep with the r-ffield remain inthis state long enough togettotheanode, even iftheir angular velocity isnot exactly correct.
This explains why the operating condi- tions ofmagnetrons are not very critical with respect tothe magnetic field, anode voltage, orother quantities which might affect the velocity oftheelectrons, FIQ.10.14.—Space charge innonoscillating magnetron.
Appreciable energy isassociated with the rOrotation.
This motion takes place, however, inasubstantially constant r-ffield, since the RO rotation keeps the electron instep with the“variations ofthe r-ffield.
Asaresult, the r-ffield has little ornoeffect onthe energy associated with theTOrotation.
This qualitative picture shows how those electrons whose initial phase relationship issuch that they absorb energy from the r-ffield areelimi- nated atonce from thespace charge.
Such electrons strike the cathode inthe course ofthe first TOperiod.
Onthe other hand, electrons which leave the cathode atsuch atime and place that they transfer energy to the r-ffield continue around the cathode inacycloidal path which expands toward the anode, transferring tothe r-ffield the energy they gain from the d-cfield. SEC.103] ELECTRON ORBITS AND THE SPACE CHARGE 335 Itmust again beemphasized that theabove description iscorrect in terms ofgeneral principles, but the detailed picture isdoubtless more complicated.

1015.—Space charge inoscillating magnetron, charge asawhole.
Intheabsence of~ffields, thespace charge forms a rotating cylindrical sheath around thecathode extending outabout half- ~vay totheanode (Fig.
10.14).
The above reasoning suggests that, under theinfluence ofther-ffields, theelectrons inthis space charge which are inanaccelerating r-ffield travel back toward thecathode, while those in adecelerating r-ffield travel toward theanode.
The result may beseen from Fig.
10.15.
The rotating cylindrical sheath isdistorted (for aneight-oscillator magnetron) into asmaller cylinder with four spoke-like ridges running parallel toitsaxis.
This space charge configuration rotates with anangular velocity which keeps itinstep with the alternating r-fcharges onthe anode segments, and theends ofthese spokes maybe thought ofasbrushing bytheends ofthe 336 THE MAGNETRON AND THE PULSER [SEC.
10.4 anode segments and thus transferring charge from the cathode tothe anode.
The r-fcurrent setupinthe oscillators isprincipally adisplacement current produced bythis rotating space charge.
Asthe spokes ofthe negative space charge pass infront ofananode segment, apositive charge isinduced onitssurface.
Half aperiod later, this positive charge has flowed around theback ofthetwoadjacent oscillators tothetwo adjscent anode segments and the spoke ofthe space charge has rotated toaposi- tion infront ofthenext anode segment.
Inaddition tothese displacement currents, conduction currents are produced bytheflow ofelectrons from space charge totheanode.
Elec- trons arrive atthe anode atsuch atime astoconstitute aconduction current approximately 90° out ofphase with the r-fvoltage, and thus have little effect onthe oscillations.

The observed quanti- ties are three innumber, usually power P,wavelength A,and voltage V.
The problem ofpresenting these observed quantities interms ofthe four parameters isgreatly simplified bythe fact that the input and output parameters operate nearly independently ofone another.

Itwould appear useful toexpress the r-floading interms ofthe resistance and reactance presented tothe magnetron atthe output loop.
Since these quantities are difficult todetermine experimentally, the Rieke diagram isacompromise between these quantities and others which can be obtained with ease experimentally.
Atmicrowave frequencies, itis customary todetermine the constants ofaload byobserving the phase and magnitude ofthestanding waves setupbyit,and theRieke diagram isdesigned touse these experimental data directly.

Magnetron Characteristics Affecting Over-all Systems Design.
One ofthe shortcomings ofmicrowave magnetrons istheir limited adaptability todifferent requirements.
This circumstance has forced the design and production ofanextremely large number oftube types.
Although the development ofmicrowave magnetrons inthis country began only inlate 1940, there now exist over 100 distinct types ofmag- netrons, despite early and continuing attempts atstandardization.
During thepast war itwas true, almost without exception, that each new radar system made new demands onthe magnetron and required the development and production ofanew type.
This hasnotbeen necessary inthe case ofconventional types oftubes, since the associated circuit elements which arelargely responsible forover-all performance lieexter- SEC.

Toafirst approximation, magnetrons ofdifferent wavelength are derived from one another bya simple over-all scaling process.
Allessential dimensions ofthetube are altered bythe scaling factor a=A/XO, where Aisthe new wavelength desired and XOisthewavelength associated with theoriginal dimensions.
Ifthk isdone, thenew tube atwavelength ~will operate attheoriginal voltage and current, and atamagnetic field H=~Ho,where Hoisthe operating magnetic field ofthe original magnetron.
The power input, and thus the power output, increases with increasing wavelength.
A rough rule is:Thepulse power output (orinput) ofsculedmagnetrons variesasthesquareoftheirwavelength.
The change inthesize ofthetube with wavelength isthebasis ofthis rule.
The pulse power input isoften limited bycathode emission and, since the cathode area isproportional tohz,pulse power input isalso proportional to~? Similar reasoning shows that ifthepulse power output islimited byr-fvoltage breakdown tvithin the tube, the same variation ofpower with wavelength istobe expect ed.
This rule isanimportant one from thestandpoint ofsystem design.
Atany given time itmay not beexact, because special emphasis may have been given toobtaining high peak powers ataparticular wave- length and abetter design evolved asaresult.
Inthelong run, however, the validity ofthe rule isreestablished, because any new design can, within limits, beused toadvantage atother wavelengths.

10.2 itwas stated that thecathodes ofoscil- lating magnetrons are subjected toback bombardment bysome ofthe electrons inthesurrounding space charge.
This bombardment produces heating ofthecathode surface which amounts toabout 5percent ofthe average power input tothe magnetron.
Ifthis back-bombardment power exceeds the normal heater power ofthe cathode (which isfre- quently turned offwhile the magnetron isoscillating) abnormally short tube liferesults.
Back bombardment usually limits the average power output.
This limit can beraised bydesigning cathodes with very large thermal dissipation, but the average power ofmagnetrons designed for radar use rarely exceeds 0.2percent ofthe pulse power output.

The circuit efficiency isthe fraction ofthe r-fpower going into the resonant system which appears asoutput power; the remainder iswasted asheat because ofcopper losses.
Electronic effi- ciencies depend onthemagnetic field, onr-floading, and onthecathode- to-anode radius ratio.
Electronic efficiencies ofabout 70per cent are realized over avery large range offrequencies.
Circuit efficiencies depend onthefrequency, since this determines theconducting skin depth which inturn governs thecopper losses.
The C/Lratio oftheresonators and ther-floading also affect the circuit efficiency.
Circuit efficiencies forthe usual r-floading vary from close to100 per cent forthe 10oo- Mc/sec range to50percent forthe25,000-Mc/sec range.
Realization ofhigh magnetron efficiency affects system design intwo ways.
High efficiency accompanies high magnetic fields which require heavy magnets.
Higher efficiencies can also beobtained bycloser coupling (Sec.
10.4), which atthe same time decreases the frequency stability.

105 PulseVoltage.—The input impedance’ ofmost pulsed magnetrons lies between 700 and 1200 ohms.
For example, magnetrons with aninput of260kw(100-kw output) require apulse voltage ofabout 15kv;inputs of2500 kw(1000-kw output) require 30kv,and one magnetron designed for6000-kw input (2500-kw output) requires apulse voltage of50kv.
Serious attempts have been made todesign magnetrons that would operate atlower input impedances because such tubes would simplify the design ofline-type pulsers.
These attempts have been unsuccessful, and 350 ohms was the lower limit inmid-1946.
The design ofmagnetrons with high impedances is,however, easily achieved, and tubes with input impedances ashigh as10,000 ohms have been produced.
Table 10.2 shows the input pulse power, pulse voltage, and input impedance of existing 10-cm magnetrons with input pulse powers ranging from 2to 6000 kw.
Power outputs can beestimated byassuming anefficiency of40percent.

For satisfactory operation, however, the tube will exhibit about thesame input impedance values.
Exact figures can beobtained from performance charts.
Pulse-1ength Limitations.—The early experiments ofthe British with high-power pulse techniques revealed acharacteristic ofoxide cathodes which isresponsible inlarge measure forthehigh pulse power ofmagne- trons.
Itwas found that under pulsed conditions oxide cathodes can emit asmuch as20amp/cm2 ascompared toabout 0.2amp/cm2 for d-cemission.
More recently, currents ashigh as100amp/cm’ have been obtained.
This current iscarried partly byprimary electrons and partly bysec- ondary electrons liberated from the“oxide cathode byback bombardment.
1Theword impedance, asused inthissection, means thevoltage-current ratio ofa magnetron attheoperating point.
Thedynamic impedance, theslope ofthevoltage- current curve near theoperating point, isvery much lower, usually around 100ohms.
SeeSec.
108. SEC.
105] MAGNETRON CHARACTERISTICS 347 Whatever thesource ofthe emission, iftoo large acurrent isdrawn for too long atime, sparking and other instabilities result.
The exact relationship between peak cathode emission and pulse length depends onthe type, temperature, and age ofthe cathode.
Toafair degree of approximation, the maxi mum permissible peak emission varies inversely asthe square root ofthe pulse length: 1-= =l/~.
Thus acathode which will emit 20amp forapulse duration of2psec will probably emit 40amp during a0.5-psec pulse.
Inconsequence, greater energy perplllse can safely beobtained forthelonger pulses.
Pulse durations greater than 5psec arerarely employed when magne- trons areused astransmitter tubes.
Frequency modulation during the pulse becomes aserious problem for longer pulses, even ifsparking troubles areovercome.
Pulse durations asshort as0.25 psec have been used successfully, particularly with high-frequency magnetrons whose starting times areshort.
Tuning ofMagnetrons.-To change the frequency ofamagnetron more than afew megacycles per second requires that achange bemade inthe resonant circuits ofthe anode.
Either the effective capacity or effective inductance must bevaried, and, since the resonant circuits are within theevacuated portion ofthetube, variation ofeither ofthem isa troublesome problem.
For this reason early magnetrons were not tunable, and only alater need forincreased flexibility ofradar systems forced thedesign oftunable tubes.
The practical advantage oftunable over fixed-tuned magnetrons isobvious.
Ifoperation onanumber offrequencies iscontemplated, a single tunable magnetron can replace awhole set offixed-frequency magnetrons, and only with atunable magnetron isitpossible ingeneral toobtain r-fpower ataspecified frequency.
The performance charac- teristics oftunable magnetrons m-eequivalent tothose ofthecorrespond- ingfixed-frequency tubes, and there isthus noreason, except availability, fornotusing them.
Tuning ofthe higher-frequency microwave magnetrons isaccomp- lished byinserting conducting cylinders into the’ inductive portion of each resonant cavity, thus decreasing the effective inductance.
This construction, sho}vn inPig.
1021, provides atuning range ashigh as12 percent, Atfrequencies lower than about 5000 Me/see, the magnitude ofthe longitudinal displacement required ininductive tuning becomes incon- venient, and other tuning methods areadopted.

resonant cavities arevery closely coupled toone another bythe straps, theoscillating frequency oftheentire magnetron isaltered.
This unsym- metrical type oftuning distorts the electric field patterns within the magnetron and therefore limits itseffective tuning range toabout 6per cent.
Advantages ofthe method are itsmechanical simplicity and its ability tohandle very high pulse powers.
Figure 10.24 shows output power asafunction oftuning adjustment.
Various other tuninz schemes have been tried, and still others will be devised, but thethree t~pes described above represent thebasic methods.
Wartime experience with radar demonstrated that tunability was very desirable but that extreme tuning range was not. SEC.

It necessitates careful engineering ofthe entire r-fsystem from magnetron toantenna, and also affects receiver design.
The problem isattacked inthree ways: (1)themagnetron isdesigned sothat itsfrequency change with changing r-floading issmalI; (2)the variations inr-floading arereduced bycareful design and construction ofther-fcomponents; (3)theradar receiver ismade insensitive tochanges infrequency bymaking itspass band broad orbyincorporating autoxriatic frequency control.
Itisthe purpose ofthis subsection todiscuss only thefirst ofthese methods ofattack, that is,magnetron design.
The effect ofloading onthe frequency ofamagnetron isusually expressed bywhat iscalled thepulling jigure,which isdefined asthetotal frequency excursion whichresultswhen astanding-wave ratioof1.5involtage 350 THEMAGNETRON AND THEPULSER [SEC.

Thus, similar magnetrons at3000, 10,000, and 30,000 Me/see would have pulling figures of,say, 5,16,and 50Me/see.
Since receiver bandwidth isnot changed substantially as the radar frequency increases, frequency stability becomes amore important consideration atshorter wavelengths.
The effect ofloading onfrequency stability and methods ofobtaining various loadings have been considered inSec.

The ratio ofthe pulling figures with and without thehigh-Q cavity forequivalent operat- ingconditions iscalled the“stabilization factor, ”which may beaslarge as10but isusually between 2and 5.

cavity has the disadvantage, however, ofreducing the tuning range of the magnetron; further, itmay aggravate mode instabilities.
Ifcon- stant-frequency operation isrequired, stabilized magnetrons should be seriously considered.
Frequency stabilization has been incorporated into only afew mag- netrons.
Agood example isthe2J41, which hasapulse power output of 500 watts at9310 Me/see and apulling figure of1.5Me/see with a tuning range of0.7percent.
The stabilization factor is10.
The 10-cm series 4J70 to4J77 isstabilized byafactor of1.5and the 1.25-cm 3J21 byafactor of2.
High-power magnetrons with high stabilization have notbeen deveIoped.
Weight.—The development ofairborne radar placed great emphasis onthe reduction inweight ofallcomponents.
Asaresult, magnetron- magnet combinations were produced inwhich every effort was made to reduce thetotal weight.
This development has been sosuccessful, par- ticularly for the higher-frequency magnetrons, that the weight ofa 352 THEMAGNETRON ANDTHEPULSER [SEC.
106 magnetron-magnet combination isnow asmall fraction ofthe weight of the pulser required todrive it.
The weight ofmagnetrons and their magnets has thus ceased tobeacritical design consideration.
10.6.
Magnetron Characteristics Affecting Pulser Design—The magnetron, standing asitdoes beLween the pulser and the r-fsystem, imposes restrictions onthe design ofboth these components.
Pulser design inparticular has been complicated bysome very strict require- ments which themagnetron places onpulse shape and voltage regulation.
These requirements arise from undesirable magnetron characteristics which ithas sofarbeen impossible toremove inthedesign ofthetubes.
They may perhaps beeliminated from magnetrons inthefuture.
The stringency ofthe conditions that the magnetron places onthe pulser oronther-fcomponents increases rapidly asthemaximum operat- ing conditions areapproached.
Thus the surest way toobtain reliable performance istooperate thetubes atconservative ratings.
Little need besaid here about theinteraction between themagnetron and the r-fcomponents.
The relationship between frequency stability, VSWR ofthe r-fsystem, and the magnetron pulling figure has been covered inSec.
10.4.
The related subject oflong-line effect isdiscussed inSec.
11”1.1 Because the interaction between the pulser and the magnetron has only recently been understood, many serious difficulties have been alleviated inthepast bytheunsatisfactory process ofcut-and-try.
Four characteristics ofmagnetrons arelargely responsible forthese troubles.
Change ofFrequency withCurrent.—The input impedance ofamag- netron varies with voltage asshown inFig.
10.29.
The average input impedance isusually inthe range of400 to1000 ohms.
Very small changes inanode potentials produce large changes inanode current.
For example, the performance chart ofa4J31 magnetron (Fig.
10.16) shows that, atamagnetic field of2300 gauss, achange ofvoltage from 20kvto22.5 kvcauses achange incurrent from 20to50amp.
Varia- tions involtage during apulse must bekept within small limits toprevent large current variations and consequent distortion ofther-fpulse shape.
The rate ofchange offrequency with anode current, dv/dI, deter- mines the amount offrequency modulation and undesirable distortion inthe energy spectrum ofthe pulse which will becaused bycurrent variation during thepulse.
Intheusual operating range formost mag- netrons, dv/dZisabout 0.1Me/see per amp, but itcan beaslarge as +1Me/see peramp.
The exact value depends toaconsiderable degree onthe operating point selected.
Toillustrate this problem, consider a magnetron with du/dI=0.4Me/see per amp driven byal-psec pulse which “droops” from 55to50amp.
This 5-amp change incurrent will 1See alsoMicrowave Magnetrons, Vol.6,Sec.7.2,Radiation Laboratory Series. SEC.
10.6] MAQNETRON CHARACTERISTICS 353 produce afrequency modulation of5amp X0.4 Me/see per amp = 2Me/see.
Since thebandwidth ofthereceiver foral-psec pulse would beabout 2Me/see, frequency modulation ofthis magnitude will result inaserious loss ofreceived energy.
When longer pulses and correspond- ingly narrower bandpass receivers areused, this problem becomes much more critical and may place very severe requirements ontheflatness of thecurrent pulse.
Instabilities.—It has sofarbeen found impossible toconstruct mag- netrons that donot occasionally present tothe pulser either avery low impedance asaresult ofagasdischarge (sparking) within thetube, ora very high impedance due toafailure ofthemagnetron tooscillate inthe proper manner (mode-changing).
Either ofthese events may occur only once ortwice permillion pulses, but when such anevent does take place, voltage and current surges arefrequently produced inthe pulser which may cause failure ofsome component.
The pulser designer must there- fore over-design components and provide special protective circuits to guard against events that may happen only once inamillion pulses.
All magnetrons change mode orspark occasionally, but the frequency of sparking ormode-changing canbereduced byoperating atmoderate peak anode currents and short pulse durations.
Magnetron performance and lifearematerially increased ifthepulser design issuch that, intheevent ofsparking ormode-shifting, anexcessive discharge does not take place through themagnetron.
These two types ofinstability, mode-changing and sparking, arediffi- cult todistinguish inpractice, since mode, changing usually produces sparking and vice versa.
Inspite ofthis, itisadvantageous toconsider them separately since thecure foreach isquite specific and distinct.
Sparking isaninternal discharge inthe magnetron which arises asa consequence ofthe generation ofbursts ofgas withh the tube.
The gasmay beliberated from theanode orfrom thecathode; ineither event thefrequency ofthe phenomenon ismultiplied byanincrease inanode voltage, anode current, orpulse length.
Operation ofamagnetron under .conditions which exceed specifications forany ofthese quantities results inavery rapid increase insparking rate.
Sparking limits themaximum pulse length atwhich magnetrons can beoperated.
Ofallthemodes ofoscillation possible inmagnetrons, only the~-mode isordinanl yused but allmagnetrons wil1sometimes oscillate inan unwanted mode, oralternate erratically between two modes.
This tendency isresponsible forsome ofthe most troublesome problems in magnetron and pulser design.

The important conclusions ofthis study aregiven here.
Mode changes areoftwo types.
One type iscaused byanode currents sohigh that they exceed theconditions foroscillation and cause transition into astate ofnonoscillation orinto another mode ofoscillation.
The second type arises from afailure oftheoscillations inthedesired mode to build uprapidly enough with respect tothevoltage riseatthestart ofthe pulse.

The second type, called “mode-skip- ping,” iscommon tonearly allhigh- power pulsed magnetrons and thus isofimportance here.
Mode-skipping isdependent not only onthe characteristics ofthe magnetron but also onthe charac- teristics ofthepulser.
Inpractice, ithasbeen necessary toconsider the magnetron and pulser asaunit.
For given magnetic field and r-f loading, there isonly alimited range ofanode voltage over which the magnetron will build uposcillations inthe,desired mode.
Ontheother hand, ifhigh-power oscillations are tobemaintained, aplate voltage at least ashigh asthis starting voltage (V.) must bemaintained atlarge currents.
This calls either foravery low- impedance pulser orforahigh pulser voltage VOatzero load current.
Consider the case illustrated in’Fig.
10.25.
Toachieve the final pulse current 1,thepulser must beadjusted toavalue ofVOconsiderably higher than the starting voltage Vs.
Under proper conditions, when thepulse isapplied tothe magnetron, the V-1curve isthat shown dotted inFig.
10.25.
The pulse voltage never rises above thecritical value Vc,because, asitreaches Vs,the magnetron draws current and loads thepulser.
If oscillation fails tostart promptly after the pulse voltage hasreached Vs, thevoltage continues torise and may exceed Vcbefore current isdrawn.
Then, since theconditions foroscillation nolonger exist, thevoltage rises toVoand oscillations inthe desired mode cannot take place.
This is what occurs when amagnetron skips modes.
The V-1 trace forsuch an event isalso shown inFig.
10.25.
The condition foroscillation inthe desired mode occurs when themagnetron starts tooscillate and todraw current inthetime interval taken forthepulse voltage topass from Vs L%C.10.6] MAGNETRON CHARACTERISTICS 355 toVc.
FortMsparticular case theprobability that themagnetron~vill start isincreased if(1)themagnetron hasashort starting time and hasa large voltage interval Vc-V, and (Z)thepulser delivers aslowlyincreas- ingvoltage between VSand VC.
The internal impedance ofthe pulser, which determines the distance that Vomust beabove VC,also plays an important role inmode stability, but the optimum impedance depends onthe characteristics ofthe magnetron and thus cannot bestated in general.
Particular combina~ions ofmagnetron and pulser frequently present situations much more complex than those shown inFig.
1025.
Asthe phenomenon ofmode-changing isbecoming better understood, improvements which alleviate the troubles are being incorporated into both magnetrons and pulsers.
The radar designer should become fully familiar with the requirements that amagnetron places onpulse shape and pulser impedance.

THE PULSER BY J.V.LEBACQZ AND M.
G.WHITE Modern radar equipments areusually based upon the generation of short pulses ofelectromagnetic radiation.
The cavity magnetron must generate electromagnetic oscillation ofsuitable frequency and power, and thefunction ofthepulser ormodulator istodeliver pow-er tothemagne- tron inasuitable way.
Cavity magnetrons have ordinarily been employed inthe generation ofmicrowaves, but afew radar equipments have been designed around triode oscillators, notably ofthe lighthouse type.
Although thepulse techniques described here were largely worked out with the magnetron inmind, the information presented isintended tobegenerally applicable toany oscillator orpower-consuming load.
The discussion will belimited tomethods peculiarly well adapted topulse powers inthe range ofafew kilowatts uptoseveral megawatts, and to pulse durations inthe range from one-tenth toseveral microseconds.
The primary aim ofthebalance ofthis chapter istogive the designer a feeling forthe over-all problem, and toassist him indeciding among the compromises required toachieve awell-balanced design.
Numerous considerations enter inthe design ofaradar pulser; of primary concern arethenature oftheload, theoutput pulse voltage and current, the pulse duration, and the repetition rate.
The operational problem faced bythe complete equipment will impose some specific requirements onthe pulser, with regard tosize, weight, supply voltage, etc.;such requirements may make itnecessary touse anotherwise less desirable design. 356 THEMAGNETRON ANDTHEPULSER [SEC.

Although final evaluation ofthe pulser per- formance requires consideration ofthe whole system and particularly of the oscillator used, much information about pulser behavior can be obtained byconsidering apure resistance load.
The following discussion ofthetypes ofpulsers inuseatpresent and their characteristics isbased onthe assumption ofaresistance load.
The general characteristics of the magnetron load will beconsidered later, and their effect onpulser behavior and design will bestudied ingreater detail forthe two main types ofpulsers.

Pulser Circuits.—To obtain substantially rectangular pulses ofshort duration and high pulse power requires that energy stored in some circuit element bereleased quickly upon demand and bereplenished from anexternal source during the interpulse interval.
Either electro- static orelectromagnetic means ofenergy storage can beused.
Inthelatter case, energy stored inthemagnetic field ofaninductance through which current isflowing isreleased totheload bysuddenly inter- rupting the current.
This can beachieved bybiasing tocutoff ahigh- vacuum tube inseries with theinductance, theresulting inductive voltage rise being applied tothe load.
Torestore the energy tothe magnetic field, itisnecessary either topass large steady currents through the inductance between pulses, ortouseafairly complicated grid-modulating circuit whose function istostart thecurrent flowing through theinduct- ance ashort time before the moment ofinterruption.
Ineither case, power losses intheswitch and auxiliary equipment are much larger than those inpulsers ofcomparable output using electro- static storage ofenergy.

This could bedoneby using aresistance asisolating element.
The very low efficiency ofthis schemel makesit unsuitable for allbut avery few special applications, such assystems requiring variable interpulse intervals.
Accordingly, inductance charging isalmost always used.
Itwill beshown later that, ifad-c supply voltage isavailable, thenetwork voltage atthetime ofdischarge isdouble the supply voltage, except forlosses inthe inductance; itwill also be shown that the network can berecharged from asource ofa-cvoltage, provided the repetition frequency isamultiple ofone-half the supply frequency.
Comparison ojtheTWO TypesofPulsers.—The basic circuit ofFig.
10.26 applies, ashas been shown, totwo types ofpulse generators.
In one type asmall amount oftheenergy stored inacondenser isallowed to bedissipated intheload during each pulse.
The switch, which must be able tointerrupt thepulse current, isalways avacuum tube, and pulsers ofthis type are commonly called “hard-tube pulsers.
”Pukers ofthe other type, where exactly the correct amount ofenergy isstored before theswitch isclosed, and thepulse isshaped bythedischarge circuit itself, arereferred toas‘‘line-type pulsers, ”since thepulse-shaping elements or pulse-forming networks have been derived from theelectrical characteris- tics oftransmission lines.
The two types ofpulsers have different characteristics, and itisof interest toanalyze briefly some ofthe considerations involved inthe design.
For instance, itiseasier tochange the pulse duration inahard-tube than inaline-type pulser, since itissufficient tochange thetime during which theswitch isconducting.
This can bedone easily atlow voltage inthedriver stage, instead ofusing ahigh-voltage switch tochange pulse- forming networks inaline-type pulser.
Methods forturning onthe switch inahard-tube pulser, discussed more fully later, generally involve asmall regenerative pulser which applies apositive pulse ‘~drive” tothe control grid ofthevacuum-tube switch.
This small pulser nearly always requires auxiliary voltage sup- plies and, inaddition, the switch-tube control grid must bemaintained beyond cutoff during the interpulse interval.
Inline-type pulsers, the ‘‘triggering” ofthe switch (orinitiation ofthe discharge) isusually accomplished with much less power than isnecessary todrive the grid ofthehard tube; inmost cases, thedriver power output isonly afew perI ISimple considerations show that, when chargi~g acondenser from zero tothe power supply voltage through aresistance, asmuch energy isdissipated intheresist- ance asisstored inthecondenser.

The output pulse shape isusually more nearly rectangular from ahard-tube than from aline-type pulser.
Except for special cases, hard-tube pulsers arealmost always built fordirect output, and thus avoid the inductance and capacity added bythe impedance- matching pulse transformer between the line-type pulser and the load, with theresulting oscillations inthe pulse shape.

16).
For hard-tube pulsers, the time jitter ispractically allvays ofthe order of0,01 psec orless.
Some specially designed gaseous discharge sJrit,ches (hydrogen thyratrons and mercury-sponge series gaps) can also give time jitters ofthesame order ofmagnitude, iftheproper precautions aretaken inthe trigger circuit.
Others have time jitters ranging from ~to3~sec forcylindrical series gaps, to20to50ysec forrotary gaps.
The simplest type ofpulser isone oftheline type, with a-ccharging and arotary-gap switch.
Inthis case, the pulser components are reduced toapulse-forming network, acharging transformer (which com- bines thefunctions ofinput step-up transformer and charging inductance), and arotary gap mounted onthe shaft ofthealternator which supplies power tothe charging transformer.
Inthis way, theproper relationship between supply and repetition frequencies iseasily maintained, and avery compact pulser forhigh power output canbemade, although such apulser has noflexibility.
Ingeneral, line-type pulser circuits aresimpler and therefore easier to service.
They also lend themselves toagreater efficiency, not only because thecircuit initself ismore efficient, but because the overhead— auxiliary circuits, cathode power, etc.—is less.
Insize and weight, fora given sebofoutput conditions, the advantage isdecidedly with the line- type pulser.
For airborne pulsers, these advantages inefficiency, size, and weight outweigh any advantage offlexibility yorpulse shape which the hard-tube pulser may offer.
Asanexample, the Mcdel 3airborne pulser (used inthe AN/APS-15), rated at144 kwpulse power output with pulse lengths of0.5, 1,and 2psec, weighs 55lband occupies aspace 15by15by16in.; with thetechniques now available little improvement could beexpected, were this pulser redesigned.
Onthe other hand, a line-type pulser with hydrogen-thyratron switch, designed for600 kw pulse output, forpulse widths of0.5and 2.5psec, weighs only 98lband has avolume ofabout 17by17by24in.

Load Requirements.—It isnot enough tosay that apulser shall produce apulse ofacertain duration and magnitude.

Confining our attention tothemagnetron, wenote inFig.
10.29 that itdisplays adynamic impedance attheoperating point ofonly 430 ohms, even though the V-1 impedance ratio is1480 ohms there.
Both the operating and thedynamic orincremental impedance areimportant; the former determines the rate at\vhich po\ver will beabsorbed from the 364 THEMAGNETRON ANDTHEPULSER [SEC.
10.8 pulser, and the latter determines insome cases the variation inpower output with small incremental changes inapplied voltage.
For example, amagnetron operating at20kvand 13.5 amp absorbs power attherate of270 kw, yet adecrease inapplied voltage ofonly 3kvwill drop the current by7amp and virtually stop the oscillation.
Since AV/A~ is small, asatisfactory pulser must produce afairly flat-topped pulse free from voltage changes larger than 5percent ofthe peak voltage.

Short-circuit and open-circuit conditions must beallowed forif thepulser isnottobedamaged.
A magnetron, orany other load, may develop aninfinite impedance be- cause ofmechanical breakage of some part ofthecircuit, orthrough failure ofthecathode toemit.
This isnotserious inthecase ofthehard- tube pulser, but thepulse-forming networkvariety generally dis- charges itsunconsumed energy in some abnormal and undesirable way.
Nopulsing system should be considered which can bedestroyed byasingle discharge ofahigh-power pulse insome unexpected part ofthe circuit.
Anaverage-current device intended toturn offthe primary power supply iftheload fails todraw power could hardly dosoinlessthan afew pulse cycles, and thus cannot berelied upon toprotect against this.
Ashort-circuited load can prove disastrous toahard-tube pulser ina few pulse cycles unless provision ismade toturn offthe primary power when the load draws too much current, since most ofthe energy which the hard-tube pulser normally delivers tothe load will then appear as anode heating oftheswitch tube.
Since itishardly practicable todesign switching tubes heavy enough towithstand this sort ofabuse forlong, overload protection must beprovided.

The pulse length, r,,may bedefined asthe interval oftime during which the load current wave iswithin 50percent ofpeak value.
Inso defining thepulse length, itisnecessary toignore arather short-duration, high-current spike often found ontheleading edge ofthe current wave.
Sodefined, TOcan beused satisfactorily incalculations ofaverage current and average r-fpower.
Successful pulsers have been designed and put into production forTOasshort as0.1psec, and aslong as5usec oralittle more.
Practical design dificultiies increase atpulse Iengths outside this range.
The voltage across themagnetron when itisoscillating vigorously ina steady state isdesignated asV-o.
Ingeneral, V~ti will liebetween afew kilovolts and 30to40kv,although itmay behigher formagnetrons inthe 1O-MW region.
Most practical pulsers donot produce aperfectly uni- form flat-top wave because this isusually costly and unrewarding.
A drop of2to5percent involtage during thepulse, AV~,, can usually be tolerated bythe magnetron without harmful frequency modulation or mode instability. 366 THE J1.1G.\-L.’T1N3.V A,VD THE Pl:LSER [SE(-.108 The rate ofrise and theovershoot onthe leading edge ofthe~wltage wave are important indetermining the ability ofthe magnetron to operate athigh power levels.
Amulticavity oscillator has several possi- blemodes ofoscillation, inonly one ofwhich itoperates efficiently and smoothly.
Great effort hasbeen devoted tounderstanding theconditions favorable tostable oscillations inagiven mode.
We now know that stability depends onboth pulser and magnetron.
Usually the pulser canbemore easily modified than themagnetron ifmode-shifting ormode- jumping occurs.
Inany event, many interacting adjustments must be made before full power output can beassured.
Sometimes achange in ther-floading ofthemagnetron, injtsheater current, orintheshape of the magnetic field will succeed ~vhere altering thepulse shape has failed.
Almost always, tooshort arisetime, t,,ofthevoltage pulse leads tomode instability, any rate ofrise over 100 kv/~sec being considered fast.’ Magnetron sparking can also becaused byhigh rates ofvoit,age rise.
A“spike” frequently appears ontheleading edge ofthevoltage pulse.
Since amagnetron operates atamagnetic field farabove the nominal cutoff value, itisimpossible forelectrons toreach theanode without the aidofthe r-ffield.
Therefore, until the field isestablished, little power isdrawn from the pulser and amomentary overvolting ofthe magne- tron results.
This phenomenon isparticularly prominent inthe case of line-type pulsers, where the voltage across the magnetron can rise to twice normal ifthe magnetron fails todraw power.
This high-voltage “spike” can give rise toallmanner ofsparking and mode troubles.
Its cure liesnotalone inalteration ofthepulser design, butalso inattention to magnet ron design.
2 The internal impedance ofthepulser plays animportant role inaffect- ingmode stability.
There aresignificant clifferences between the opera- tion ofhard-tube and ofline-type pulsers.
3The hard-tube pulser hasan internal impedance equal tothat ofthe output tube, which varies from 90to150 ohms until saturation isreached.
The line-type pulser, being essentially aconstant-voltage device inseries with animpedance equal tothe load resistance, has aresistance of400 to1200 ohms.
Conse- quently, the conditions ofstable operation foragiven magnetron w-ill vary with load and pulser type.
Stable operation occurs for those values ofVand 1which simultaneously satisfy the load and generator characteristics.
This would not concern usexcept that the various modes have different V-1characteristics, thus giving cause forinstability.

We must also pay attention tothe reverse voltage V~,which most pulsers put across themagnetron after themain-power pulse has passed, forinsome cases V~l may belarger than V~Oand lead tobreakdown of the magnetron insulation.
This same reverse voltage may also appear across various parts ofthe pulser circuit itself unless steps aretaken to suppress it.

Ifasufficiently large positive pulse beapplied tothecontrol grid ofTl,thecathode will emit electrons vigorously and theanode will drop from itshigh positive potential tojust that potential required topass the plate current demanded bytheload.
Since the voltage across Cocannot change instantaneously, thepoint A’ will assume ahigh negative voltage, which isapplied totheload.

During the pulse, the potential ofCO(and hence the voltage across the load) slowly declines unless C,ismade very large.
Inany practical design itisusually desirable tomake C,nobigger than absolutely neces- sary, the criterion being the permissible voltage drop while carrying acurrent pulse ofdefinite magnitude for the duration ofone pulse.
Expressed more quantitatively, Co=Ito/AV_O.
If1=10amp, to=1 psec, and thepermissible voltage drop AV~O =100volts, wefind that CO must be0.1pf.
The sizes ofL,,L,,and R,depend upon how quickly itis desired tobring thetail ofthepulse down tozero once thegrid drive has been removed, and also onhow much energy one iswilling towaste in these elements during thepulse.
There exists anupper limit tothe size ofthe coupling condenser, because avery large capacity would take longer torecharge fully after a pulse.
Given afixed pulse rate and recharging impedance, anincrease incoupling capacity will beaccompanied byanincrease inthe no-load tofull-load voltage ratio.
Ineffect, alarge capacity gives poor regula- tion.
Should thedesigner attempt torecover this loss bydecreasing the size ofthe recharging impedance, there will result anincreased curren I drain from the power supply through the switch tube during the pulse, thereby causing anincreased switch-tube drop.
Careful balancing of these factors isrequired toachieve most efficient design.
Occasionally, the most efficient operating voltage ofthe magnetron orload does not correspond totheoptimum plate voltage forT1,sothat there must besome impedance-matching device between pulser and load.
The primary ofapulse transformer may beinserted atAA’and theload connected across the secondary with orwithout the damping element L,R,.
Generally speaking, the insertion ofapulse transformer changes somuch thecharacter ofthepulse tailthat itisnecessary toalter radically theso-called “tail damping” circuit.
The most flexible and satisfactory damping system isahigh-voltage diode connected across the magnetron todraw power only onthebackswing.
TheSw”tch Tube.—Since the vacuum-tube switch isthe heart ofthe hard-tube pulser, the characteristics desirable inaswitch tube will be briefly mentioned.
Itmust beable tocarry easily thecurrent demanded bythe load; inthe interest ofefficiency, the anode potential required should beaslow aspossible.
Since amajor source ofpower waste inthe circuit isinthecathode-heating required tosustain the desired emission, itiscustomary touseoxide-cathode emitters wherever possible.

Where extreme reliability and relative immunity to overload are required, the designer will prefer the thoriated-tungsten cathode switch tube inspite ofitsgreater cathode power requirements.
Switching tubes oftheoxide-cathode variety usually canbecounted upon toemit 300 to600 ma/watt ofheating power while the emission ofthe best thonated-tungsten cathodes isonly about 100 ma/watt.
The oxide-cathode tube islimited inpower output bythe onset of grid emission.
Itisimpossible toprevent thermionically active cathode material from contaminating the grid structure.
Great care must be taken, therefore, tocool thegrid byfins, heavy rods, and other means, for itcan emit afew milliamperes even atasub-visible temperature.
Afew milliamperes may sound small incomparison with several amperes pulse current, but afew milliamperes flowing allthe time can cause serious heating ofthe anode and screen, which areatrelatively high potentials.
Usually the result isarunaway condition inwhich grid control islost.
The most successful oxide-cathode high-power switch tube isthe 715B developed atBell Telephone Laboratories.

—The most economical pulser would have power flowing only during thepulse.
Ofcourse, energy must flow back torecharge those elements which store and deliver pulse power, but the design should not include vacuum tubes that conduct during the time between pulses, and areturned offduring the pulse.
Judicious use of plate-coupled and cathode-coupled circuits usually will permit alltubes tobebiased tocutoff except during the pulse.
Pulse transformers can also beused forphase reversal, impedance-matching, and circuit isola- tion.
Means are now available for computing the important design parameters ofsuch pulse transformers.

The discharging circuit is very simple, and itsindividual components arediscussed insome detail hereafter.
The pulse transformer will beconsidered inthefollowing sec- tion, since itisapplicable toboth types ofpulsers.
Ingeneral, itcan be said that the effect ofboth the switch and the pulse transformer isto decrease therate ofrise ofvoltage attheload from that which would be produced bythe network alone.
The switch usually introduces an appreciable resistance during itsionizing time, and thepulse transformer introduces anadditional inductance inseries with theload.
However, a spike voltage isoften encountered inpractice, asmentioned previously, because ofthe time required forthe magnetron todraw current after thenormal voltage isapplied toit.
When itisnecessary toprevent the appearance ofaspike, a“despiking” circuit isused asindicated inthe diagram.
The resistance ofthis circuit ischosen equal tothe network SEC.

The appro- priate value ofinductance ateach end oftheline differs slightly from that inthemiddle sections.
Ithas been found practically that theoptimum number ofmeshes isrelated tothe desired pulse length asshown inthe following table.

Most problems offabrication have 376 THEMAGNETRON ANDTHEPULSER [SEC.10.10 been overcome.
Perhaps TiOz, orsome similar material ofhigh dlelectnc constant, will find wide use outside the low-voltage field.
Another promising approach tothe condenser design problem isthe electrochemical formation ofvery thin insulating films onmetal (such asthose employed intheelectrolytic condenser) onwhich alayer ofmetal isthen deposited, High capacity per unit area results from the very small spacing, but the insulating film must beable towithstand the extremely high field strengths thus imposed.
Further attention tothe details ofmechanical design ofcondenser fittings-containers, bushings, connectors, and thelike—is also required.

Apulse network designed tohave adequate lifeatone pulse rate would overheat and perhaps beruined by operation atahigher repetition frequency.
Since overheating isafunc- tion ofboth applied voltage and repetition rate, little flexibility remains inaline-type pulser designed toachieve maximum economy ofweight, space, and power.
Provision can bemade forshortening pulse length bybringing outtaps onthe pulse line.
However, this israther difficult athigh power, because oftheproblem ofdesigning suitable line switches.
The Sw”tch.—The possible advantages ofthe line-type pulser greatly stimulated the design oflow-impedance spark switches and thyratrons, since itbecame possible tosecure flat-topped pulses without thenecessity ofopening the switch.
Rotary spark gaps, ‘‘trigatrons,” series gaps, hydrogen thyratrons, and mercury thyratrons have allbeen used asnet- work switching devices.
Each has itsfield ofapplication.
Each switch islimited inone ormore ofthefollowing respects: (1)poor precision of firing, (2)low maximum pulse rate, (3)short lifeonlong pulses, (4)nar- row operating range ofvoltage, (5)occasional erratic firing, (6)inefficient cathode, and (7)unnecessary complication.
The ideal switch has not yetbeen designed.
Figure 10.39 shows schematically the simple “series gap” s\vitch.
The Western Electric’ 1B22 isagood example ofthis class ofswitch; it consists ofacathode cylinder ofaluminum surrounding ananode rod of 378 THE MAGNETRON AND THE PULSER [SEC.
10.10 thesame material.
The tube isfilled toapressure ofalittle lessthan one atmosphere with amixture of75percent hydrogen and 25percent argon.
Two orthree tubes areused inseries, with avoltage divider across them toensure that thenetwork voltage isdivided equally among allthegaps before the pulse takes place.
Triggering isaccomplished asshown in Fig.
10.39 bydepressing orraising quickly thevoltage ofthetwo middle electrodes.
This breaks down one ofthe gaps and throws full voltage across the second gap.
The overvolted second gap thereupon also breaks down, forming alow-impedance path between points Aand A‘.
These switches areefficient and arequite satisfactory inuse.
Their chief limitations areinthe allowable pulse repetition frequency (about 2000 DDS maximum) and inobtainable precision ofpulse timing.

Apparently the mercury cathode series gapcanbe designed tofirevery precisely.
The “trigatron” (Fig.
10.40) differs from the series gap inhaving but one spark gap, across which thefullline voltage isapplied.
Conduc- tion isinitiated byapplying asteep high-voltage wave toatrigger elec- trode; this presumably draws corona current sufficient toinitiate the main discharge.
Atypical trigatron istheBritish CV85.
This hasthree electrodes inamixture ofargon and oxygen atapressure ofapproxi- mately 3atmospheres.
Atriggering voltage ofapproximately 4kvis required tofirethetube when itistodeliver 125kwofpulse power into a70-ohm load.
The precision oftriggering usually isabout +0.2psec, unless special precautions aretaken toinsure correct trigger wave shape and amplitude.
The most versatile switch isthenewly developed hydrogen thyratron (Fig.
10”41), which requires apositive trigger ofonly 150 volts rising at the rate of100 volts perpsec.
In contrast tospark devices, the hy- drogen thyratron will operate over a very wide range ofanode voltages without readjustment.
This char- acteristic isparticularly important forexperimental pulsers, orforany pulser whose probable load isin doubt.
Ingeneral, itisdifficult to reduce the voltage across aspark switch bymore than afactor of2 from the nominal design voltage without encountering erratic opera- tion.
Voltages substantially higher than thenominal design value cause aflash-over intheswitch.

The anode ofahydrogen thyratron iscompletely shielded from the cathode bythegrid.
The effective grid action results invery smooth firing over awide range ofanode voltages and repetition frequencies.
The hydrogen thyratron, unlike most thyratrons, has apositive grid-control charac- teristic, and hydrogen filling isused toreduce deionization time and make theperformance ofthetube independent ofambient temperature.
This independence ismaintained with the exception that the average dissipa- tion rating ofthetube canbelowered byexcessively high airtemperature. :.10.10 SEC.
10.10] LINE-TYPE PULSERS 381 The hydrogen-filled thyratron (Fig.
10.41) can satisfactorily pulse at much higher frequencies than ispossible with mercury orother heavy-gas fillings, because ofthe high ionmobility inherent inthe light-gas filling.
Ofcourse, the average-power rating ofthe tube must not beexceeded when going tohigh pulse rates.
Ingoing tohighpulse rates, the pulse width must bedecreased faster than l/f, since theaverage anode drop at durations ofafew tenths ofamicrosecond ishigher than that during a long pulse.
The hydrogen inthe discharge seems torequire about 10–7 sectobecome fully ionized, sothat ahigh tube drop isrequired todeliver thenecessary initial current.
Itistherefore desirable toreduce thepulse power output aswell aspulse width iftube lifeistobemaintained at increased repetition rates.
Pulse rates upto40,000 cps have been obtained atreduced power output.

Virtues claimed forthe nonlinear inductance switch arelong life, ruggedness, and simplicity.
The switch can beoperated atpulse repetition frequencies upto4000 pps and at power levels inexcess ofseveral hundred kilowatts.
The rotary spark gap, because ofitsgreat simplicity and high power handling ability, has been widely used asaswitching device.

Current flows from 4’tothe disk pinand out through asecond spark atpgint A.The simplicity ofthis device is partially offset byanuncertainty ofupto~50psec infiring time, and by thenarrow voltage range over which satisfactory operation occurs.
The display-tube sweeps must betriggered bythe appearance ofthe power pulse because ofthegreat uncertainty infiring time.
Ifjisthespeed of the disk inrpm, and nisthenumber ofpins, theresulting pulse rate is nf/60.
For agiven power output, there isanoptimum spacing between ~otating and fixed pins, and aminimum permissible spacing between pins inthe rotating disk.
These quantities vary somewhat with disk speed, sothat itisnoteasy todesign arotary spark-gap pulser forvariable pulse rate.

PulseTransformers.—The devel- opment ofpulse switching tubes and ofpulse loads has proceeded so independently that usually there islittle correlation between theoptimum impedance levels forbest operation ofthese two devices.

The usual practice istochange thepulse lengths inversely with thepulse rate, thus keeping average power constant.
But, because ofthe com- plications inherent inchanging pulse length byswitching pulse networks, the pulser designer isalways inclined tostick toone pulse width.
If pulse rate must bechanged without acompensating change inpulse width, itisusually necessary tocontrol therectifier output byswitching pgwer transformer taps orbyvarying aseries primary impedance.
The present design ofhigh-voltage, low-average-current rectifying diodes isquite satisfactory.
There arenow available diodes ofreasonable dimensions, high inverse rating, and good life, covering most practically useful ratings.
Thoriated tungsten cathodes areuniversally employed; these have satisfactory mechanical strength and are economical of filament power.
Efficiency could befurther increased bythe develop- ment ofafilamentless rectifier.
This would permit operation without filament transformers which, insome circuits, must beinsulated forhigh voltage.

The R-f Transmission Problem.—In the block diagram ofa basic radar system shown inFig.
14, the parts shown asheavy double lines transmit theradio-frequency (r-f) energy from themagnetron tothe antenna, and carry the faint echo signals into the T-branch where the receiving apparatus islocated.
For the types ofradar treated inthis book this function isperformed bycoaxial lines and waveguides.
A considerable body oftheory and anew setoftechniques have grown up around this class oftransmission circuits.
The essential new feature is, ofcourse, that thewavelength isofthesame order asthephysical size of the circuit elements; the length ofthe line may bemany wavelengths.
Although space permits only alimited treatment here,l sufficient intro- duction will begiven toshow thegeneral approach, and tomake under- standable some ofthe reasons forcurrent practices inmicrowave radar.
Standing Waves.
—When avoltage issuddenly applied tothe input terminals ofalong and uniform transmission line, ‘the current which flows intheinitial interval, before reflections from thefarend arrive toconfuse the situation, isdetermined bythe property ofthe line known asits “characteristic impedance.

Only iftheline isperfectly matched willthevoltage reading beconstant as theprobe moves along.
The ratio ofthemaximum totheminimum volt- age iscalled the “voltage standing-wave ratio” (VSWR) and istheusual criterion ofhow well aline ismatched.
Complete reflection atthe end ofthe line, such aswould beexpected from anopen circuit orashort circuit, results inzero voltage athalf-wave intervals and aVSWR of infinity.
The mismatch may also beexpressed asapower ratio (PSWR), orindecibels.
The relations between these three measures are PSWR =(VSWR)Z SWR, db=10log,, (PSWR).
Quarter-wave andHalf-wave Lines.—It can beshown that when aloss- less transmission line ofcharacteristic impedance Z,aquarter wavelength long isterminated inanimpedance 2,,theinput impedance is Zi=Z~/Zl.
(1) This property iswidely used.
For example, two transmission lines of differing impedance canbematched toeach other byjoining them through aquarter-wave line whose characteristic impedance isthe geometric mean ofthat ofthe two lines.
This iscalled amatching transformer.
Or, ifaquarter-wave line isterminated byashort circuit, the input impedance isinfinite, i.e., equivalent toanopen circuit.
Conversely, anopen-circuited quarter-wave line appears atthe input terminal tobe ashort circuit.
For alossless line halfawavelength long 2,=2,, (2) irrespective ofthe characteristic impedance ofthe line.
This principle has many uses also, particularly induplexers (Sec.
11.5) and mixers (Sec.
118). SEC.
11.2] COAXIAL LINES 393 WhyaMatched Line?—The fraction ofthe incident power reflected tothe source from asection oftransmission line ofgiven VSWR is Power reflection coefficient =[(VSWR) –1]’ [(VSWR) +1]2(3) For theusual upper design limit ofVSWR =1.5,itisseen that thepower reflection loss isonly 4percent, or0.3db,surely not serious.
Inhigh- power systems orunpressurized airborne systems, where line breakdown isapossibility, the strain isofcourse higher forahigh VSWR.
Aratio of1.5means that foragiven breakdown gradient, 33percent less power can bedelivered tothe load than could bedelivered inamatched load.
This can bealimitation.
The strongest requirement forawell-matched line arises from the properties ofthe magnetron.
Like allself-excited oscillators, the mag- netron exhibits anoutput frequency and astability dependent upon the load into which itworks.
Amismatched line represents aresistance lower than 20atvoltage minimum, and higher than ZOatvoltage maxi- mum.
Atother phases ithasareactive component which maybe either positive ornegative.
Asexplained inChap.
10,magnetrons areingen- eral designed tobestable against aVSWR of1.5inany phase.
This is theorigin ofthe commonly specified upper limit formismatch.
There isafurther limitation ifthe mismatch occurs atthe end ofa long line-for example 50to100wavelengths from themagnetron.
Then asthefrequency changes thenumber ofwavelengths intheline changes, and soalso does the phase ofthe standing wave.
The line impedance seen atthemagnetron istherefore arapidly varying function offrequency.
Ifatacertain frequency thephase happens tobesuch that thevariation ofreactance ofthe line with frequency ismore rapid than that ofthe magnetron itself, and ofopposite sign, acondition results where themag- netron has nostable frequency.
Inanother, favorable, phase the mag- netron isstabilized.
This isknown asthe “long line effect.’” The result isthat forlong lines either (1)VSWR’S lower than 1.5arenecessary toguarantee stable magnetron operation, or(2)amethod ofchanging theeffective line length and hence the phase ofthe standing wave must beincluded inthe antenna line.
The latter may bedone bya“line stretcher” not unlike atrombone, orinwave guide byasqueeze section oradielectric phase shifter.z These add anundesirable adjustment.

The superi- ority ofthenoncontact type employing choke joints has led toitsuniversal adoption.
The principle isshown inits simplest form inFig.
11.6a.
The gap between the stationary and rotating parts ofboth conductors issituated at theend ofanopen-ended quarter-wave coaxial line.
As was mentioned in Sec.
11”1, the impedance atthe input end ofanopen quarter-wave section (in this case across the gap inthe line) is zero.
Power flows across without loss orsparking.
Closer analysis shows that the open end ofthe quarter- wave section ontheouter conductor isnotaninfinite impedance, because there issome radiation, producing afinite radiation resistance.
This effect can bereduced, and the match improved, byadding ashort-cir- cuited quarter-wave line inseries with the outer gap, asinFig.

Asimilar improvement ismade onthe center conductor.
Advantage istaken ofthe negligible current across thetransition between thefirst and second Quarter-wave sections tomake acontact bearing between theinnermost conductors.
This isagreat aid inkeeping the closely spaced tubes allconcentric.
Quarter-wave line sections used inthe manner just described toprevent loss ofmicrowave energy into side channels aretermed “chokes.” The nominal characteristic impedance ofthe standard rigid coaxial lines inregular use is50ohms, corresponding toaratio of2.30 forthe radii ofthe inner and outer conductors.
This isacompromise between aratio of3.60 (77ohms), which, foragiven outer diameter, gives the lowest attenuation due toconductor losses, and aratio of1.65 (3oohms) which maximizes the power that can becarried with agiven breakdown voltage gradient.
Since the attenuation ina50-ohm line isonly 10per cent greater than itisina77-ohm line, itisnot acostly compromise.
Increasing thesize ofboth conductors toincrease theairgap and thereby increase the power-carrying capacity cannot becarried onindefinitely, since ahigher mode ofpropagation, with diametral rather than axial R symmetry, can beexcited when the mean circumference ofthe annular dielectric space exceeds one wave- length.
The possibility oftwo modes ofpropagation existing simultaneously inasingle lineleads toserious complications.

Waveguide.—Although ametallic pipe ofalmost any shape will transmit orguide electromagnetic waves iftheir wavelength inairis short enough, rectangular tubing whose internal dimensions have aratio between 2.0and 2.5hasbeen almost universally adopted where theprob- lem issimply thetransfer ofmicrowave energy.
(Use ofround guide in the special case where axial symmetry isrequired isdiscussed inalater paragraph.) Adetailed understanding ofthe propagation ofwaves ina region bounded byconducting walls can only beobtained from thesolu- tion ofMaxwell’s equations.
Practically, however, the results ofthe mathematical analysisl have come tobeused inaprocedure which retains most oftheconcepts oftransmission-line theory, with equivalent lumped reactance connected atsuitable points toaccount forthe effects of discontinuities.

For asingle stub, aslight correction tothelength isnecessary to allow forthe inductance ofthe crosspiece, but when the stubs become a solid tube, nolines offorce can link the narrow side, and the quarter- wave distance becomes exact.

Asthe dimensions ofthe waveguide areincreased, the frequency being fixed, propagation becomes possible bymodes—that is,byparticular types of“vibration” intheelectromagnetic field, other than thefunda- mental mode illustrated inFig.
11.9.
Each ofthese higher modes has itsown characteristic electromagnetic field configuration.
ordinarily itisadvisable toavoid propagation inmore than one mode, and this is most easily done bychoosing the dimensions ofthe guide sothat the lowest mode, and the lowest mode only, can propagate.
However, for certain applications some ofthe higher modes are useful.
Anotable example, towhich weshall return later, isthesecond mode”in waveguide ofcircular cross section.
This has axial symmetry and isthus useful in waveguide rotary joints.
For each type ofwaveguide there exists acritical, orcutoff, frequency forpropagation inthe lowest mode.

Ifthewidth ismore than awholefree-space wavelength, ahigher mode ofpropagation with anode intheelectric field down thecenter becomes possible, which adds most undesirable complications.
Therefore, the broad dimension must liebetween ahalf and awhole free-space wavelength.
The wave- length inside theguide islonger than that infree space and isgiven bythe relation: (4) where xisthefree-space wavelength and A.isthecutoff wavelength (here equal totwice the broad dimension).

The transitions from rectangular toround guide aredesigned toavoid exciting the undesired mode asfaraspossible.
The guide wavelengths ofthe desired and undesired modes aresufficiently different sothat asuitable choice oflength ofround guide will minimize coupling ofthe undesired mode from onerectangular guide totheother.
Various absorbers forthe undesired mode aresometimes used.
The power-handing abilityofawaveguide, calculated from theelectric fields involved, isapproximately twice that ofthelargest coaxial line that SEC.

Since, how- ever, thedistortion ofthenormal field bythestub supports ofthecoaxial line makes itimpossible torealize the calculated limit, the factor oftwo does notrepresent thefullsuperiority ofwaveguide.
Ineither waveguide orcoaxial line, small nicks, burrs, orsolder fillets can easily cause break- down atafifth ofthe calculated maximum power.
Table 11.1 sum- marizes theproperties ofthewaveguides widely used inmicrowave radar, and for comparison those ofsome standard coaxial lines and cable.
Attenuation inwaveguide isseen tobeabout half that inthe largest coaxial line suitable foragiven wavelength.
For smaller coaxial lines ofagiven impedance the attenuation isinversely proportional t6 diameter.
The conclusion tobedrawn isthat waveguides aresuperior electrically tocoaxial line innearly every respect.
They are easier to fabricate because the inner conductor and itsprecisely machined stub supports are simply omitted.
For these reasons, waveguide isalmost universally used forwavelengths below 8~cm.

For ‘(long wave” radars (wavelengths of50cmand greater) wave guide isnever used because ofitsrelatively enormous size.

Resonant Cavities.-If both ends ofawaveguide are closed byashort-circuiting plate, and energy isintroduced byaprobe sosmall that itdoes not appreciably change the properties ofthe enclosure, the amplitude ofthe standing-wave pattern inthe waveguide will show a sharp maximum when the frequency issuch that the length ofthe enclosure isanintegral number ofhalf guide-wavelengths.
The reflec- tions will then beintheproper phase toreinforce each other and cause a resonant buildup.
(This isthe property used inwavemeters.) For standard rectangular guide, reference toEq.
(4)shows that ifthe broad dimension istaken tobe0.707~ then half aguide-wavelength isalso 0.707A.
The shortest resonant piece ofsuch awaveguide istherefore square.
The height does not affect the resonant wavelength, though if itisgreater than A/2, modes polarized atright angles tothedesired mode become possible.
Rounding offthe corners ofthe square box shortens the resonant wavelength slightly; exact calculation shows that for a cylindical box theresonance occurs when X=1.30 times thediameter, as opposed to1.41 times the side ofthesquare.
These round and square boxes areexamples ofresonunt cam”ties, which play thesame role inmicrowave transmission circuits asdoresonant cir- cuits involving lumped inductance and capacity intraditional circuit theory.
Any hollow metal enclosure iscapable ofsupporting oscillations inalarge number ofmodes.
Inpractice the geometry isusually chosen soonly asingle mode, often thelowest, isexcited.
For simple geometn- 406 R-FCOMPONENTS [SEC.
114 d forms the properties are completely calculable from Maxwell’s equations.
Incavities ofthe type used inmagnetrons, the inductance and ,:apacity arefairly well separated and approximate numerical values can becalculated though they cannot bemeasured independently.
For something like a+,mple cylindrical cavity, however, inductance and capacity are blended and cannot even becalculated unambiguously.
The significant quantity istheresonant frequency orwavelength.
The second property ofcavities that isimportant inmicrowave work istheir Q.
Asinlumped-constant circuits, the value ofQisameasure ofthe sharpness ofthe resonance, and isdetermined bythe dissipative elements loading theresonant circuit.

w(6) Ifwincludes only the dissipation within the cavity itself, due tothe resistance ofthe walls and todielectric losses ininsulators within the cavity, etc., theQdefined above iscalled theunloaded Q,usually written Qo.
Ifwincludes, inaddition, energy dissipated inexternal circuits coupled tothe cavity, weobtain instead the loadedQ,orQL, which of course can never exceed Qo.
Inasimple cylindrical cavity made ofcopper and resonant at3000 Me/see initslowest mode, the unloaded Qisabout 15,000.
Generally, theQofacavity loaded only bytheresistance ofitswalls depends onthe ratio ofthe volume ofthe cavity tothe product ofthe internal surface area and the skindepth.
For cavities ofsimilar shape, theresonant fre- quency joisinversely proportional toalinear dimension ofthe cavity; theskin depth varies asl/fro.
Itfollows that Qo,forcavities ofsimilar shape, varies asl/@o.
Onthe other hand, the Qvalues that can be attained atmicrowave frequencies, typified bythe example just given, aremuch higher than can bcrealized with coil and condenser combina- SEC.

The essential reason forthis isthat such low-- frequency circuits donotprovide acorrespondingly large volume forthe storage ofenergy.
Tomake acavity useful itisnecessary toprovide some means of introducing and removing energy, orinother words tocouple ittothe external circuit.
This may bedone byanelectron stream, byacoupling loop toacoaxial line, orbyaniris (hole) leading into awaveguide.
Examples ofthese arecited inthediscussion ofklystrons (Sec.
11.7) and ofTR switches (Sec.
11.5).
11.6.
Duplexing and TR Switches.-As was explained inSec.
1.3, the use ofacommon antenna for transmitting and receiving requires fast-acting switchesl todisconnect the receiving apparatus from the antenna during the transmitted tron pulse, and todisconnect the mag- netron during the period when echoes are being received.
These two switches are called the TR (transmit-receive) switch and the anti-TR orATR switch, respec-W lhQ.11.14 .—Duplexing system ontw~wire tively.
The duplexer isthat por- transmission line.
tion ofthemicrowave circuit, near theT-junction ofthe receiving branch and the magnetron-antenna line, where theTR and ATR switches arelocated.
The great disparity intransmitted and received powers immediately suggests that aspark gap orgas-discharge tube can beconnected inth-e circuit insuch away astoperform the necessary switching operations.
These gas-discharge tubes arereferred toasTR orATR tubes.
Arudi- mentary system using atwo-wire transmission line isshown inFig.
11.14.
The high-power pulse from the magnetron breaks down the gap inthe ATR tube and thepower flows outtoward theantenna.
The gap inthe TRtube inthereceiving branch likewise breaks down, and ifitisdesigned sothat the discharge takes negligible power tomaintain, puts ashort circuit across theline tothereceiver.
The delicate input circuits ofthe receiver arethereby protected.
Since theshort circuit isaquarter wave- length from the T-junction, the impedance put inparallel with the antenna line atthe junction isvery high and does not affect the wave traveling toward theantenna.
Atthe end ofthetransmitted pulse, the discharge across thegaps goes outand thesystem isready toreceive echo signals.
The impedance attheT-junction looking toward themagnetron isinfinite because there isanopen circuit half awavelength away.
1Microwave Dupb%rs, Vol.
14. 408 R-FCOMPONENTS [SEC.
11.5 Looking toward the receiver, there isamatched line.
Allthe power goes into thereceiver.
Inonevariation ofthebasic scheme just outlined, thereceiver branch joins theantenna line inaseries rather than inashunt T.
Then theTR switch must beahalf wavelength rather than aquarter wavelength from the junction.
Inanother variation, advantage istaken ofthe fact that thecold (i.e., nonoscillating) impedance ofcertain types ofmagnetrons is such astobeabad mismatch tothe line, sothat nearly allthe power coming toward the magnetron isreflected.
Then the ATR switch can beomitted ifthe line length between the magnetron and T-junction is chosen correctly.
This isknown as“pre-plumbing.” With many types ofmagnetron itisnot feasible.
The requirements forsatisfactory transmission ofthe outgoing pulse arerather easily met.
1.The loss inthe discharge across the gaps must beasmall fraction ofthe magnetron power.
2.The line must bematched when the gaps arefired.
From the point ofview ofthe receiver, the requirements aremuch more stringent.
1.During the transmitted pulse, the power getting past the TR switch into the reniver must beless than 0.1watt orthe crystal may bedamaged.
This means aminimum attenuation of60to 70db.
2.The TR-tube gap must fire inless than 0.01 psec, orthe preigni- tion “spike” ofmagnetron energy may burn out thecrystal.
3.The gap must deionize inafew microseconds attheend ofthemag- netron pulse sothat echoes from nearby objects will not beunduly attenuated.
Atypical specification would demand less than 3-db attenuation 6psec aftqr the pulse.
4.The received signal must see areasonably good match into the receiver, and thelosses must bekept toaminimum.
Some refinements intherudimentary system ofFig.
11.14 areneces- sary tomeet the above requirements.
The fired TR-tube gap isnot a perfect short circuit.
Ifthevoltage across thearcisV,theleakage power going tothe receiver isV2/Z, where Zisthe impedance looking toward the receiver, measured atthe gap terminals.
The voltage can bemade smaller byhaving thedischarge take place inagasatapressure ofonly a few millimeters ofmercury.
Further reduction ofleakage power is neceseary, however.
This may bedone byastep-up transformer tothe gap, and anidentical step-down transformer tothereceiver line.
Inthe unfired condition, the standard line impedance ismaintained oneither side oftheTR switch, but inthefired condition theline impedance seen atthe gap appears tobevery high and much less power iscoupled out tothereceiver. SEC.
115] DUPLEXING ANDTRSWITCHES 409 The practical method ofaccomplishing this impedance transformation isbymeans ofaresonant cavity.
Figure 11.15 shows asection through a1B27 TR tube and associated cavity, with input and output couplings.
The gap across which thedischarge takes place isformed bytwo reentrant cones onthe axis ofsymmetry ofthe approximately cylindrical cavity.
The cones add capacity totheresonant circuit and thecavity issmaller forthe same wavelength than itwould bewithout them.
Tuning is accomplished bypushing one cone inand out onaflexible diaphragm.
The unloaded Qofthecavity islower than that ofacylinder because of FromT-iunctionFlexible \nd,aphragm I~ \RetainingrmgI @,Isol,,,,Oit .

With normal input and output loading, theloaded Qisabout 35o.
Both input and output coaxial lines end incoupling loops which play the role ofthe step-up and step-down transformers.
They can bethought ofassingle-turn windings which, inproportion totheir area, loop more orless ofthemagnetic field existing inthecavity.
The smaller theloop, thehigher the step-up ratio and the higher the loaded Q.
Asaresult ofthe impedance transformation, the arc coupling (i.e., the power going tothe receiver asaresult ofthe voltage across the arc discharge) iswell below the danger point and isindependent ofinput power.
There isasecond mechanism ofcoupling, called direct coupling, which gives leakage power proportional toinput power.
Atthe higher transmitter powers, direct coupling becomes more important asasource ofleakage power than arccoupling.
Direct-coupling power isthepower 410 RFCOMPONENTS [SEC.

Toinsure rapid breakdown at thebeginning ofeach pulse, aSUP plyofions inthegapismaintained by acontinuous auxiliary dis- charge inside one ofthe cones.
This requires anextra electrode, known asthe ‘‘keepalive” elec- trode, which draws about 150pa from an800-volt supply.
Abal- last resistor drops the voltage to about 400 volts atthe electrode itself.
Despite this precaution, the leakage power through aTR tube shows aninitial spike (Fig.
11.16) which precedes the “flat” region ofconstant leakage power.

Molecular ions have somuch inertia that atthe frequencies involved they cause negligible attenuation.
Water vapor isthe constituent usually introduced tohurry theelectron cleanup.
Atypical filling would behydrogen atapressure of10mm ofmercury, and water vapor likewise atlo-mm pressure.
The hydrogen gives protection ifthewater vapor is frozen out, but deionization will then beslow.
Argon isused insome tubes instead ofhydrogen.
The loss tothereceived signal inpassing through anunfired TR tube isfrom 1.0to1.5db,occurring mainly inthewalls ofthecavity. SEC.11.5] DUPLEXING AND TR SWITCHES 411 Figure 11.17 shows acut-away view ofanother type ofTR tube, the 1B24, which iswidely used inthe3-cm band.
Itisoftheintegral-cavity type—that is,allofthecavity contains gas, notjust thecentral portion.
Agas reservoir onthe side increases the total volume ofgas over that contained inthe relatively small 3-cm cavity.
The tube isclamped between standard 3-cm rectangular choke joints, and coupling into and out ofthe cavity isbymeans ofround windows oririses.
Glass is soldered across them toseal the gasenclosure.
Such windows play the same role incoupling cavities towaveguide asdocoupling loops for coaxial line.
On10-cm systems using waveguide, theinput coupling may be bymeans ofaniris, and theoutput by acoupling loop.
Switches exactly like TR switches with theoutput coupling omitted may beused asATR switches.
However, since thedouble adjustment ofthetwo switches isnotalways made correctly, fixed-tuned, low-Q ATR switches are preferable.

Experimentally itisfound that inthe presence oflocal-oscillator power flowing through it,acrystal generates more noise power than would anequivalent resistor atthat temperature.
Asameasure ofthis prop- erty, acrystal isassigned a“noise temperature, ”defined astheratio of theabsolute temperature atwhich anequivalent resistor would generate the observed noise tothe actual temperature.
Noise temperatures between 1.1and 3.0 are typical.
The noise generated bythe crystal increases with local-oscillator input.
There isarather broad region of best over-all performance at0.5to1.0mw input which isacompromise between increasing noise athigh inputs and greater conversion loss at lowinputs.
This optimum input corresponds tothewidely used standard operating point of0.5-ma d-ccrystal current.
The contact area between the whisker and the silicon isofthe order ofl~b cmz.
Relatively low currents, therefore, yield high current densities, with attendant local heating and danger ofburnout.
For continuously applied power thedanger line isoftheorder ofawatt; this would apply tothe flat part ofthe TR-tube leakage.
The initial pre- ignition spike (Fig.
11.16)issoshort (less than 0.01 psec) that the heat cannot beconducted away from thecontact; consequently thetotal spike energy rather than the peak power isthe important quantity.
Experi- ence has shown that burnout isfarmore likely tocome from the spike than from theflat.

The great excess ofpower permits loose capacitive coupling between local oscillator and crystal.

MOUNTING THE R-F PARTS Experience has demonstrated that good radar performance depends not only onawell-designed setofmicrowave components but also ona properly coordinated mounting ofthem, relative toeach other and rela- tive tothe other parts oftheradar.
Therefore itisnecessary toadd to the treatment already given ofthe components themselves aconsidera- tion ofthe engineering reasons forthe accepted practice ofgrouping certain vital components inamajor unit called the “r-f head.
” 11.10.
Reasons for anR-f Package.
Preferred Grouping ojCom- ponents.—Considerations ofaccessibility and convenience would often argue forputting most ofthecomponents ofaradar setnear theindicator rather than near the antenna, which, inorder toget the proper view, must usually beataremote orisolated point.
However, the long-line eflect discussed inSec.
11”1 makes along transmission line from magne- tron toantenna something tobeavoided ifpossible.
Inaddition tothe fact that inalong line even amoderately low standing-wave ratio can cause instability yinthemagnetron, theextra junctions, bends, and elbows needed foralong line are themselves likely toadd tothe mismatch.
Furthermore, asseen from Table 11”1, ther-fattenuation inalong line, particularly atthe higher microwave frequencies, results inthe loss of several decibels when two-way transmission isconsidered.
The shortest possible r-fline isrealized bymounting the magnetron ontheback oftheantenna reflector (“back-of-the-dish system”).
This ideal arrangement isoften notpractical because ofagroup ofcomponents functionally associated with the magnetron which may betoo large and heavy forthe antenna mount tocarry.
The pulse transformer must be adjacent tothemagnetron toavoid 1ong high-voltage leads, which would have tobesupported and properly insulated and would add unwanted capacity.
The duplexer T-junction and the TR tube must, ofcourse, gointhemagnetron-antenna line.
The extremely low-level echo signals coming through the TR tube must beconverted tothe intermediate frequency and amplified considerably before being transmitted toa remote point.
The local oscillator must beclose, because the AFC is based onacomparison ofthefrequency ofthelocal oscillator and that of the ruagnetron.
Electrical and functional considerations dictate, then, that thefollow- 420 R-FCOMPONENTS [SEC.
11.10 ingminimum items bemounted inagroup and that thegroup beasnear theantenna aspractical: 1.Pulse transformer.
2.Magnetron.
3.Duplexer, TR and ATR tubes.
4.Local oscillator.
5.Radar and AFC mixer.
6.AFC control circuits.
7.I-famplifier (usually uptol-volt video level).
This setofcomponents, mounted asagroup and usually inaclosed container, iscalled the “R-f Head.” Alternative terms are“R-f Unit” and “Transmit-receive Unit.
”Beacon local oscillator and beacon AFC areincluded where beacon reception isrequired.
Insmaller radar sets, the modulator network and switch tube and even the modulator power supply may beput with ther-funit.
Anextension ofthis trend leads to anarrangement with allparts ofthe radar except the controls and the indicator tube inasingle container.
Adoarztaqes ofanR-fPackage.—On allbut the largest radar sets the group ofcomponents listed intheprevious paragraph can becompactly mounted inasingle container that isnot too heavy forone man, orat most two men, tocarry.
There isconsiderable advantage inhaving the vital parts ofthe transmitter and receiver centralized inaremountable unit package.
Intheevent oftrouble, aspare r-fhead canbesubstituted and connected into therest oftheradar inafew minutes.
Diagnosis of trouble, repair, and readjustment, aswell asassessment ofperformance, can allbeperformed onawell-equipped test bench.
This isparticularly helpful forairborne sets.
Good engineering practice favors pressurization ofther-ftransmission lines ofmicrowave radar systems inorder tokeep out water and water vapor.
For high-altitude operation, pressurization may beabsolutely necessary toprevent breakdown oftheline.
The high-voltage cathode circuit ofthe magnetron isasimilar case.
Pressurization assures dry conditions and sea-level pressure, and thus makes unnecessary thehuge insulators and large airclearances that standard engineering practice would otherwise prescribe.
Other parts ofthe r-fhead can bemade smaller and more compact ifpressurized conditions areassumed.
Itis but aslight extension toconsider that ther-fhead should gointo asingle pressurized container, with thepressure common tother-fline outtothe antenna.
Such aplan solves two other problems: (1)theworking parts ofthe r-fhead are protected against the most severe conditions of moisture, salt spray, and dust, not only inuse, but also during shipment and storage; and (2)theshielding problem isgreatly simplified, both for keeping external disturbances outofthedelicate parts ofthereceiver, and SEC.11.11]DESIGN CONSZDERA TZONS FORTHER-FHEAD 421 forconfining the disturbances setupbythe radar transmitter sothat they donot affect other equipment.
11.11.
Design Considerations forthe R-f Head.—The form which ther-fhead takes will depend onwhether itoperates ontheground, ona ship, orinanairplane; onthedegree ofexposure totheelements; and on thepower and transmitting frequency ofthemagnetron.
Pressurization hasadvantages and disadvantages.
Among thelatter areinconvenience resulting from inaccessibility yofparts foradjustment and repair, and difficult yoftransferring heat through the pressure wall.
The r-fhead ofasmall airborne setwill undoubtedly beacompletely pressurized unit.
The r-fhead ofavery large ground setmight operate inside aprotective housing and notbepressurized atall.
Between these two extreme types aredesigns where part ispressurized antf part isnot.
Nofirm rules can belaid down.
The treatment here will outline theconditions that must bemet, and then give illustrative examples oftwo quite different designs.
HeatRemoval.
‘—The maximum safe ambient temperature formost ofthe r-f-head components—such ascomposition resistors, oiI-paper condensers, and blower motors—is about 85”C.
The temperature ofthe airaround ther-fhead may getashigh as50”C indesert areas inside a housing exposed tothesun’s rays.
Iftheunit isnotpressurized theper- mitted dMerential of35°C iseasily met.
The airfrom asimple blower, properly channeled, will readily carry theheat released inside theenclos- ure out into the surrounding air.
Often the airfrom the magnetron cooling blower can besodirected astodowhat additional cooling is needed.
Subunits tightly enclosed forreasons ofelectrical shielding may, however, need additional circulation.
Where thefree flow ofexternal airthrough ther-fhead isblocked off, asitmust bebyapressure housing, theproblem oftransferring theheat totheoutside aircan easily bealimiting factor indesign.
The difficulty isnot ingetting the heat through the actual metal wall.
Ashort com- putation shows that adifferential ofafraction ofadegree issufficient for this.
Almost allofthe temperature drop occurs across the dead-air films onthe two sides ofthe wall.
Natural convection results ina transfer coefficient ofonly 0.006 to0.010 watts/in2 per ‘Cdifference in temperature between the airand the wall.
If30”C betaken asasafe figure forrise ofinternal airover external air, and ifnatural convection beassumed onboth sides, then theaverage coefficient given above would result inamaximum thermal load of0.12 watt s/in2.
Forced convection from agentle current ofairalong thesurface raises thecoefficient to0.02 watt s/in2 per“C,but beyond this increased velocity results inonIy aslow increase.
Ahigh-velocity flow ofperhaps 50ft/sec isnecessary to achieve afigure of0.04 watts/in2 per“C.

1111 The increase inthe coefficient isdue mainly tocreating aturbulent layer where good mixing occurs close totheactual wall, and toreducing the thickness ofthe poorly conducting layer.
The cooling blast fora magnetron approximates the necessary conditions, but maintenance of turbulent flow over large areas takes considerable power.
The conclusion isthat with moderate blowing onthe inside and natural convection outside, the loading can increase to0.17 watts/inZ, and with blowing onboth sides canincrease to0.3watt siin2, foranover- ,Blowers T1II I I I (a) (b) FIG.11.26.

These figures areallapproximate, since the geometry isnever simple and uniform conditions ofairflow over awhole vessel arenever realized.
Radiation plays aminor role inheat transfer ~orthedifferentials here involved.
Painted rather than bright surfaces areworth while, however.
Fins arehelpful inincreasing effective area, especially with natural con- vection, though not inproportion toactual surface.
Ifthe forced con- vection isnotalong thefins they donothelp atall,because theincreased area iscompensated byimpediment toairflow.
Two schemes toimprove heat transfer are shown inFig.
11.26.
In a,the internal and external blowers aredirected atthe same portion of thewall, which has some fins atthat point atleast toincrease effective area.
Inthe region ofturbulent flow directly under the blower output thetransfer coefficient ishigh.
Inthe second case, b,there isanouter shell close tothe wall ofthe pressure container.
Apowerful blower maintains turbulent flow over thewhole interspace and ahigh coefficient results.
This may berepeated ontheinner wall ofthepressure housing. SEC.
11.11]DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FORTHER-FHEAD 423 TypesojContainer.—If ther-fhead isnotpressurized, thesupporting framework forthe parts will bearectangular affair consonant with the standard construction practices used ontherest oftheradar.
The usual rules ofaccessibility and convenience will dictate theplacement ofparts.
If,however, theunit istobepressurized, further consideration must be given tothe container.
Itisalmost essential tobeable toremove the pressure cover and make tests and adjustments without disconnecting the r-ftransmission line orany power orsignal cable.
This rules out methods ofmounting the units inwhich the support brackets attach Although rectangular containers aremost economical ofspace, they aredifficult topressurize because oftheir tendency tobecome spherical under pressure, with resultant severe shear strains inthe corners.
Ina ship set,where only small pressure differentials areexpected, arectangular cover isfeasible.
Ifitisnottoolarge, arectangular housing cast outof light metal canbemade strong enough tostand the30lb/inz test pressure required forairborne r-fheads.
Ithas been common practice, however, tousecylindrical housings with domed ends because only tensile strains arethen involved and thehousing can bevery light.
One example ofpressurized airborne container design isillustrated inFig.
11.27, and discussed fully inSec.
11.12.
The heat generated inthemagnetron rises astheaverage power level isincreased, but the generation ofheat inthe receiver components is substantially constant from one radar settoanother.
Ifthetransmitter power ismore than about 50kw, the thermal load forany pressurized 424 R-F COMPONENTS [SEC.

Under these circumstances, itiscustomary tomount the magnetron anode and thepulse transformer case outside thepressurized shell, with anexternal blower tocool them.
The cathode connection tothemagne- tron ismade inapressurized inner compartment, into which gasketed bushings bring thepulse transformer output and themagnetron cathode leads.
The waveguide r-fline ispressurized from themagnetron output tothepressurized compartment which houses theduplexer, aswell ason theantenna side.
Inthis arrangement, high voltages appear only inside pressurized spaces, while most oftheheat isliberated intheopen, where itcan becarried away bytheairstream from theexternal blower.
Metering andTestPoints.—Good radar performance depends on ob.jective tests ofthe functioning ofeach part.
The vital radar com- ponents areallcentralized inther-fhead, and theproviding ofnecessary test points there isapart ofthedesign job.
Testing should not require removal ofany covers.
Adirectional coupler, used tointroduce thetest signal, will belocated ontheantenna line either just outside ther-fhead orjust inside with cable feed toatest jack onthe outside wall.
Atthe higher microwave frequencies, cables and cable fittings introduce avari- able element and the external location would bepreferred.
The video output jack required can bethenormal output totheindicator, inwhich case aninterchange ofcable isrequired.
Ifthe video output tube is capable ofhandling parallel loads, asecond jack fortest purposes on]y would beadded.
Ifthe test setrequires atrigger signal atthe time of themagnetron pulse, this can beobtained byinserting afew ohms inthe bypass-to-ground circuit atthe low end ofthe pulse transformer.
The signal would goinashielded cable toanappropriate external jack.
The other checks onthe operation ofthe r-fhead divide themselves into (1)minimum informa.t ioncontinuous yavailable toaremote opera- torand (2)tests tobeperformed with the cover removed.
The average magnetron current isthe most important single item in monitoring aradar set.
Ifithas the correct value, the magnetron is operating atthe recommended point onitsperformance chart and is almost certainly putting r-fpower into the antenna line.
Sparking ofthe magnetron orirregular modulator operation can beobserved.
This meter reading isanover-all check onthe operation ofthe radar transmitter.
The second most important item forthe operator tomonitor isthe radar crystal current.
Ifthis maintains itsoriginal value, itisknown that thelocal oscillator isfunctioning and thecrystal hasnotchanged its properties.
Adecrease may indicate aburned-out ordamaged crystal.
Arhythmical variation indicates that the AFC issearching but not locking. SEC.
11.12] ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF R-F HEADS 425 Asingle remote meter with aselector switch, orselector relays inthe r-fhead, can perform these minimum monitoring functions attheopera- tor’s position.
Ifthe sethas beacon AFC, the radar-beacon switching relay should transfer the remote meter tothe beacon cavity crystal.
Then asteady meter reading indicates not only that thebeacon AFC is locked, but that itislocked atthe correct frequency, since the crystal energy has come through thereference cavity.
Ofthe test points usually provided forcover-off checking, the most essential isajack tomeasure thecrystal current atevery crystal, inorder topermit adjustment ofthe Iocal-oscillat orcoupling.
On crystals where thesame current ismetered remotely aswell, acut-in jack isused.
Another current worth metering istheaverage diode current inthesecond detector, forover-all sensitivity ytests and checking thereceiver.
Ajack formeasuring the keep-alive current intheTR tube should beincluded toprovide verification that theTR switch isperforming normally.
Inradar sets where the r-fhead isaccessible toanoperator during operation, allofthe above metering can bedone onasingle meter and selector switch.
The most important internal signal test point istheAFC video output.
Onanoscilloscope thediscriminator output isseen, aswell asany spuri- oussignals.
Sometimes this ismade aphone jack also, sothat with apair ofheadphones aural indication ofcrossover may becompared with the frequency ofbest tune.

The long pulse, asshown in Sec.

The waveguide fittings inside ther-fhead arenot airtight; they com- municate the head pressure tothe antenna waveguide run.
However, electrically thewaveguide iskept sealed astightly aspossible inorder to prevent the general level ofleakage power intheclosed container being high enough tointerfere with AFC operation.
The sealing isdone by woven metal gaskets atevery junction.

The TRtube isa1B24.
Itsr-fselectivity ishigh enough (about 50Me/see between the half-power points) sothat when tuned upforradar reception the loss inreceiving beacon signals may be asmuch as.20db.
This loss isaverted byasolenoid-actuated plunger inserted inthe wave guide onthe low-power side ofthe TR tube ata distance ofhalf aguide-wavelength from itsoutput window.
Byadjust- ingthe depth ofinsertion, theTR tube can bepulled into good tune for thenew frequency.
The outputs ofthe radar and AFC crystals goindouble-shielded cables tothe receiver and AFC chassis respectively.
The AFC control circuit isessentially oftheform described inSec.

For best use of theavailable space, thereceiver chassis isintheform ofasegment ofa circle.
The normal chain ofi-famplifier stages, second detector, and video output stage, isarranged around theperiphery.
The bandwidth of thei-famplifier is5Me/see, but forlong-pulse operation arelay switches thebandwidth to1.0Me/see bychanging theloading ofone oftheinter- * stage timed circuits.
This isnecessary torealize the full gain insensi- tivity tobeexpected from thelo~g pulse.
The bandwidth isstill 5times the reciprocal pulse length, rather than thevalue of1to2times estab- lished asoptimum inSec.

There aretwo reasons forthis: (1)fre- quency modulation of~he magnetron owing tovariations ofcurrent during thelong pulse can lead toaspectrum wider than theoretical; and (2)itisdifficult tomake apractical AFC that will hold asetintune toa small fraction ofamegacycle persecond.

H.JORDAN INTRODUCTION BYL.J.HATVORTH 12.1.
The Role ofthe Receiving System.—It isthe purpose ofthe receiving system toextract the information contained inthe radio- frequency echoes, tosort itinterms ofthe geometrical parameters involved, and topresent the results tothe observer inaconvenient and useful form.
The data involved areinavariet yofforms.
Most ofthem come from theradar setitself.
Ihrst inimportance, ofcourse, aretheecho signals, which may contain asmany asseveral million separate pieces ofinforma- tion each second.
The exact instant atwhich the radar pulse istrans- mitted isknown byvirtue ofapulse toorfrom the modulator.
The geometrical coordinate ofrange isproportional tothereturn time ofthe echo pulses with respect tothis pulse.
The orientation oftheantenna is available interms ofthe rotational positions ofshafts geared tothe scanner axes.
These direct data are often supplemented byothers (obtained from external sources orfrom observation ofthe composite radar results), such asgeographical information, thelocation and orienta- tion ofthe radar platform, ifitisamoving one, and soon.
Within thelimitations ofthese data and therequirements ofthepar- ticular situation, the equipment should present tothe observer acon- tinuous, easily understandable, geometrical picture ofthe radar targets under study, giving thelocation, size, shape, and, insofaraspossible, the nature ofeach toany desired degree ofaccuracy.
Inmany cases, the equipment should have provisions forinstantaneous ydetermining ina precise numerical way the exact position ofeach target with respect to the radar setortoother targets, and often itshould furnish means for passing these results onto other devices inanautomatic way.
Allofthis must bedone insuch amanner that theecho signals have optimum sen- sitivity compared tointernal system noise and toextraneous radiations.
The accomplishment ofthese objectives requires aconsiderable array ofequipment.
The ultimate link with the observer isthe indicator.
The indicator proper isusually supplemented byaconsiderable amount 433 434 THERECEIVING SYSTEM—RADAR RECEIVERS [SEC.121 ofauxiliary equipment, the chief functions ofwhich aretoprepare the geometrical and other data, apart from thesignals, forusebytheindica- tor, tocontrol the indicator functions, and toassist inthe making of measurements.
Nosatisfactory descriptive term exists forthis auxiliary equipment, but incombination with the indicator itisknown asthe “indicating (or indicator) equipment.
”The echo signals must be amplified greatly and demodulated before being presented tothe indica- tor, usually intheform ofvideo signals.
The path which they follow in this process will bespoken ofasthe“signal channel,” and theequipment involved asthe “receiver.” Onsome occasions thesystem also contains computers orother devices which aidintheultimate disposal ofthedata.
The receiver must deliver amaximum ofdesirable, and aminimum ofundesirable, information toihe indicator.
Itshould have aslittle inherent noise aspossible, Since such noise determines theultimate limit insignal detectability y.
Itshould afford sufficient amplification to realize this ultimate limit and sufficient dynamic range toallow wide latitude inuseful signal intensities.
The bandwidth must bechosen to provide sufficiently rapid transient response sothat the details ofthe signals will bepreserved; butitmust notbesogreat astodecrease unduly the signal-to-noise discrimination.
Inmany cases, special design char- acteristics enhance the discrimination ofcertain kinds ofecho incom- parison toother undesired echoes ortoradiations from other transmitters.
The indicating equipment, which isalmost entirely responsible for the purely geometrical aspects ofthe display problem, must share with the receiver the responsibility forthe discernibility ofthe signals with respect tonoise, interference, and signals from other targets.
The indica- torproper isalmost always acathode-ray tube whose screen presents the radar display.
Synthesis ofsuch displays involves combining the signal intelhgence with antenna scanning angles and uther geometrical factors toprovide anintelligible picture ofthedispositions and other characteris- tics oftheradar targets.
Some ofthedisplays are, inprinciple, facsimile representations oftheactual geometrical situation; others aredeliberately deformed toimprove some particular type ofobservation ormeasurement.
Awide variety ofdisplays has been discussed inChap.

The basic types arelisted here forreference: 1.De$ection-modulated displays, inwhich the echo signals are used todeflect the beam laterally onthe tube face.
Inpractice, the other rectangular coordinate isinvariably range (A-scope, R-scope, etc.).

ATypical Receiving System.—Figure 12.1 illustrates the principal parts and some ofthesubdivisions ofatypical receiving system containing acathode-ray-tube indicator.
Thereceiver isalways ofthesuperheterodyne type and consists ofthe signal channel and the local oscillator, together with frequency-control circuits forthe latter.
Strictly speaking, this should include allequip- ment concerned with thereceived signal, beginning with theantenna and ending with the input terminals ofthe indicator proper.
However, in practically allradar applications the antenna, the TFi tube, and the r-f line connecting them areshared with thetransmission channel, and the techniques inthese sections aredictated somewhat more bythe trans- mitter requirements than bythose ofthereceiver.
We shall, therefore, consider thereceiver asbeginning atthepoint where thesignal channel branches from that which isshared with thetransmitter.
R-fsignals from theantenna byway oftheTR switch enter acrystal mixer where they are combined with the c-w output ofatuned local oscillator toform aheterodyned signal atthe desired intermediate fre- quency, usually 30to60IUc/sec.
This signal isledfrom themixer into anintermediate-frequency amplifier ofvery special characteristics, where 1Ifthenormalizations areequal thedisplay is,ofcourse, equivalent toCategory a 436 THERECEIVING SYSTEM—RADAR RECEIVERS[SEC.

The signal channel iscompleted byavideo amplifier which delivers the signal atproper voltage level totheinput terminal ofthe CRT orother indicator.
Asinallsuperheterodynes, tuning isaccomplished bycontrolling the frequency ofthelocal oscillator.
Since theratio ofthebandwidth tothe carrier frequency isextremely small (ofthe order ofone part inafew thousand), the tuning iscritical.
Some form ofautomatic frequency control isessential ifconstant manual tuning adjustments are tobe avoided.
Methods ofAFC inpulse radar practice are quite different from those ofradio ortelevision; inradar, frequency control isexerted bypassing aportion ofthe transmitted signal through amixer and i-f amplifier, and maximizing itsintensity bythe use ofafrequency dis- criminator and electrical circuits, which tune thelocal oscillator.
When theradar istorespond tobeacon signals, thereceiver must be tuned tothe beacon transmitter rather than tothe local one.
Inthis case, analternate local oscillator (not shown inFig.
12.1) isforced to oscillate inresonance with astandard cavity whose frequency differs from that ofthebeacon bytheintermediate frequency ofthe receiver.
Theindicating equipment consists ofthe cathode-ray tube together with the auxiliary vacuum-tube circuits and other devices necessary to thesynthesis ofthedisplay.
Those elements ofthe cathode-ray tube essential toageneral under- standing areshown inFig.
12.1.
Inaddition tothescreen, these consist ofahot-cathode electron source, a“control grid” whose potential deter- mines thebeam intensity, and amechanism fordeflecting thebeam.
In theexample illustrated, the deflection mechanism consists oftwo orthog- onal pairs ofparallel plates between which the beam must pass, the deflection due toeach pair being proportional tothe potential across it.
Inanother type oftube, the deflection isproduced byamagnetic field resulting from current inacoil orcombination ofcoils surrounding the tube “neck.” Arrangements forfocusing thebeam arenot illustrated.
The equipment auxiliary tothe cathode-ray tube varies widely with different situations but afew general statements can bemade.
Those parts concerned with thepulse-repetition cycle arecollectively called the “timer.” The timer provides synchronization with the modulator, sweeps and markers forthedisplay and measurement ofrange, blanking ofthe cathode-ray tube during unused portions ofthe pulse cycle, and other related operations which may arise inspecial cases.
The remaining equipment, apart from thenecessary power supplies, ismainly concerned with the display and measurement ofgeometrical quantities other than range. 438 THE RECEIVING SYSTEM—RADAR RECEIVERS [SEC.
122 Since time isalways measured with respect totheinstant atwhich the modulator fires, synchronization between themodulator and thetimer is ofbasic importance.
Insome cases, thetimer exerts precise control of exact firing time ofthernodulat orbysendingit atriggerpulse;in others, itresponds toatrigger from themodulator.
Inthelatter case, thesys- tem issaid tobe‘iself-synchronous.
”1Although certain advantages can often bederived bygiving control tothe timer, this cannot always bedone,z and itissometimes inconvenient inamultiple-display system.
Figure 12.1 illustrates aself-synchronous system.
Some ofthe depar- tures possible when thetimer does thesynchronizing will bepointed out intheappropriate places.
The cathode-ray tube must beturned ononly during the fraction of thepulse cycle inwhich itisused.
One portion ofthetimer generates a square wave (Waveform b,Fig.
12”1)which performs this function and usually finds other applications within thetimer.
Ifthedisplay includes arange sweep, asisnearly always thecase, the timer generates the waveform that ultimately produces it.
This wave- form usually consists ofalinearly increasing voltage wave which begins attheinitiation ofthesweep and returns totheinitial condition atitsend (Waveform c,Fig.
12.1).
This involves aswitching action which, as indicated inFig.
12.1, isusually provided bythesame square wave that turns onthecathode-ray tube.
The timer generates asetofdiscrete range markers: sharp video pulses occurring atregular, precisely known intervals.
Inaself-synchronous system, the markers must berecycled oneach transmitter pulse; this requires atransient oscillator.
Inthe simple example illustrated, the square wave bprovides the necessary switching voltage.
Often the discrete range markers are supplemented byacontinuously variable range marker which may begenerated inany ofseveral ways.
Asindi- cated inFig.
12.1, the markers areusually mixed with the radar video signals and the combination applied tothe cathode-ray tube.
Insome cases, however, the signals and the markers are applied separately to different electrodes ofthecathode-ray tube.
The equipment illustrated does not provide forthe use ofadelayed sweep.
Ifone istobeused, separate square-wave generators areneces- sary toswitch the range-marker circuit and toperform the other func- tio&.

The latter must beprovided with adelayed trigger which may come from acontinuously variable timing circuit ormay beone pulse ofa discrete set, often therange-marker pulses themselves.
The continuous type ofdelay isfrequently associated with acontinuous precision range marker (Sec.
13.12).
31any deviations from Fig.
12.1 arepossible ifthetimer provides the synchronizing pulse.
Inparticular, thediscrete range markers can then bederived from ahigh-precision c-w oscillator, one ofthemarker pulses being selected asthe modulator trigger byascaling-down process.
A continuous marker canalso beprovided from this oscillator bymeans ofa continuous phase-shifting device.
Other advantages ofthe timer-con- trolled synchronization entail the use ofa‘‘pre-trigger” bymeans of which theactions ofcertain circuits can.beinitiated somewhat inadvance ofthefiring ofthe modulator.
h~any other functions, some ofwhich will appear inlater sections, are performed bythe timer incomplex situations.
The functions ofthose indicator circuits not included inthe timer vary widely with thedifferent display types.
For illustrative purposes, Fig.

The former requires noequipment beyond that already described.

This may befurnished, insimple cases, byalinear potentiometer geared tothescan axis.
simplification may sometimes be necessary before applying theazimuth sweep voltage tothecathode-ray tube.
The circuits shown areequally applicable toamagnetic tube, the only appreciable changes being inthedeflection amplifiers.

For example, Fig.

The PPI ofFig.

This ismade totake the direction onthetube face that corresponds tothe instantaneous antenna orientation bysome form of electromechanical repeater.

THE RECEIVER BYW.
H.JORDAN 12.3.
Special Problems inRadar Receivers.—Radar receivers, though similar inprinciple toall radio receivers, differ from them insome respects.
This fact ischiefly duetoadifference inemphasison some of the functions.
For example, itwould befoolish todesign abroadcast receiver with theultimate insensitivity when theweakest signal that can bedetected isdetermined largely byman-made and natural static.
In theradar portion ofthespectrum, ontheother hand, external sources of interference are normally negligible, and consequently the sensitivity that can beachieved inaradar receiver isnormally determined bythe noise produced inthereceiver itself.
Methods ofreducing this noise are ofprime importance inradar receiver design.
Not only must noise be kept down, but everything possible must bedone tominimize attenua- tion ofthe signal before itisamplified.
How this has influenced the design ofr-fcomponents hasalready been seen.
The effect onthedesign ofi-famplifiers will bedeveloped inthis section.
The lack oflow-noise r-famplifiers orconverters inthe microwave region has meant that most microwave receivers convert the r-fsignal toani-fsignal directly inacrystal mixer and then amplify thei-fsignal.
This lack ofprevious amplification complicates the design ofthe i-f amplifier, asisshown bythe following expression, given inChap.
2,for theover-all receiver noise figure.
N..,rd, =~(Ni-[ + T’–1)1 where g=gain oftheconverter, T=noise temperature oftheconverter, Ni., = noise figure ofthei-famplifier.(1) Agood crystal inawell-designed mixer will have anoise temperature Tthat isonly slightly more than 1.This means that the over-all noise figure isreduced indirect proportion tothe reduction ini-fnoise figure.
Hence itisimportant todesign thei-famplifier tohave anoise figure that approaches asnearly aspossible thetheoretically perfect value of1. 442 THERECEIVING SYSTEM—RADAR RECEIVERS [SEC.
12.4 Another very important factor inradar receiver design isthat of securing agood transient response.
Reception ofpulses about 1~secin length imposes severe requirements onthe pass band ofthe amplifier.
Atthe same time, the amplifier must becapable ofamplifying pulses several hundred microseconds inlength and yet befully sensitive toa weak signal immediately following.
Itmust recover immediately from a signal thousands oftimes stronger than theminimum discernible signal.
Frequently special requirements are placed onthe receiver.
For example, itmay berequired that itrespond toweak pulses even inthe presence ofac-w signal ofconsiderable strength.
The problem of detecting aweak target echo inthepresence ofstrong seareturn issome- what similar.
Special circuits which gounder thegeneral title of“anti- clutter circuits” areusually required insuch cases.
The unique requirements outlined inthe foregoing three paragraphs have resulted inareceiver that isconsiderably different from anything previously existing.
The design ofi-fand video amplifiers tomeet these requirements will bediscussed inthefollowing sections.
12.4.
I-fAmpliiier Design—In anideal i-famplifier, allthe noise would originate inthegenerator connected toitsinput terminals-that is, B+ Fm.12.4.—Pentode input circuit.thecrystal that serves asconverter in theusual radar receiver.
Inany prac- tical amplifier there are additional sources ofnoise.
Thermal noise from resistances intheinput circuit and shot noise due tothe uneven flow ofelec- trons totheplate ofthefirst tube are the chief sources ofexcess noise, al- though later stages may contribute slightly.
For this reason, care must betaken inthe design and tuning ofthenetwork coupling thecrystal to thefirst grid aswell asinthechoice oftheoperating conditions and type of thefirst tube.
Figure 1264 shows atypical input circuit, with the primary tuned to resonate with the crystal and mixer capacity atthe intermediate fre- quency, and with thesecondary tuned toresonate with theinput capacity ofthe tube and socket.
The coils are usually fixed-tuned or“slug- tuned” 1inorder toavoid any extra capacity.
The only loading onthe circuit isdue tothe crystal and the input resistance ofthe tube; thus, there arenoadditional resistances tocontribute thermal noise.
Thermal 1Theinductance ofa‘1slug-tuned” coilislowered bytheeffect ofeddy currents induced inametallic rod(slug) inserted inoneendofthecoil.

12.4] I-F AMPLIFIER DESIGN 443 noise due totheresistance inthe coils themselves can bekept negligibly small byusing coils ofmoderate Q.
The coupling between primary and secondary ispreferably magnetic, since capacitive coupling gives asome- what poorer noise figure.
The amount ofcoupling isusually fixed ata value that gives the best noise figure.
This isnecessarily greater than critical coupling, and inthecase ofa6AC7 seems tobeabout transitional —that is,just before adouble hump appears inthe pass band.
The bandwidth with this amount ofcoupling depends upon thecrystal resist- ance and the mixer and tube capacities.
Since the crystal resistance is small (around three orfour hundred ohms), the bandwidth isusually adequate, being around 10Me/see between half-power points.
Con- siderably greater bandwidths can beobtained bypaying attention tothe mixer capacity.
Anumber oftube types have been tried inthefirst stage; however, most radar receivers today usethe6AC7, 6AK5, or717.
The 6AK5 and 717 are very similar inelectrical performance and give alower noise figure than the 6AC7; however, the latter isstill widely used.

Ingenerai, theplate and screen voltage should below (75to120volts arecommon) and the cathode current should beashigh asispermitted bythetube ratings.
The noise figure that can beobtained byuse ofthe circuit shown in Fig.

Since itvaries considerably with individual tubes ofthesame type and manufacture itisdesirable toquote average figures.
Some representative values aregiven inTable 12.1.

12.4 atriode isless noisy than apentode.
The difficulty inusing atriode lies infinding acircuit that isstable, uncritical inadjustment, yet with enough gain toswamp out noise originating inthe following stage.
A circuit that hasrecently been developed isshown inFig.
12”5.
The input transformer Tissimilar totheone used forpentodes.
Inorder torealize the ultimate noise-figure capabilities ofthe circuit, the Qofthe coils must bekept high.
The circuit shown inFig.
12”5 consists ofagrounded~athode tri- ode working into agrounded-grid triode.
The input impedance ofa grounded-grid amplifier stage isvery low, being approximately l/gn, or 200 ohms fora6AK5.
Since this impedance loads the first stage so heavily that itsvoltage gain isabout 1,there isnotendency foritto oscillate, even without neutralization.
L — Fm.12.5.-—Triode input circuit.The loading issoheavy that the interstage bandwidth isvery great.
Since the value ofL2isthus non- critical, thecircuit is,infact, fixed- tuned.
Inductance Laisani-f choke ofalmost any characteris- tics.
Thus the circuit isstable and uncritical; itonly remains to beshown that the noise contr- ibution ofthe second triode is small.
This isnotobvious, and a rigorous proof isbeyond thescope ofthis book (see Vol.
18ofthis series).
Inorder tominimize the second stage noise, theimpedance seen when looking back from the cathode ofthesecond triode must be large compared totheequivalent noise resistance atthis cathode.
To make this impedance ashigh aspossible, aninductance L1isconnected between plate and grid ofthefirst triode.
Inductance L1resonates with the plate-grid capacity attheintermediate frequency.
This inductance isnotneeded forstabilit ybutdoes improve thenoise figure about 0.25 db.
Noise figures obtainable with the double-triode circuit depend on several factors; representative values areshown inTable 12.1.
Improve- ments of2dbormore over thepentode circuit areusual.
Before describing the i-famplifier, abrief dkcussion ofsome ofthe factors involved inchoosing the intermediate frequency will begiven.
The over-all receiver bandwidth should befrom 1to10Me/see topass the pulses ordinarily encountered inmicrowave radar sets.
1Aninter- 1Inthis chapter i-famplifier bandwidth willbetaken between thehalf-power points; video amplifier bandwidths will bemeasured between thefrequencies at which thevidee rmponse is3dbdown.
The over-all receiver bandwidth (i.e., the SEC.
12.4] I-FAMPLIFIER DESIGN 445 mediate frequency considerably greater than this isrequired inorder that i-fsine waves can befiltered out ofthevideo amplifier.
Local-oscillator noise can beminimized bythe use ofahigh intermediate frequency; however, thebalanced mixer (cf.Vol.
16ofthis series) provides abetter solution tothis problem.
Many ofthepresent AFC systems require the use ofahigh intermediate frequency toprevent locking onthe wrong sideband.
Finally, components such ascondensers and coils become smaller asthe frequency israised, adistinct advantage inlightweight airborne radar sets.
Ontheother hand, there areatleast two very cogent reasons forfavoring alow intermediate frequency: (1)the noise figure ofthei-famplifier issmaller atlower frequencies, and (2)manufacture and maintenance isconsiderably simplified because variations intube and wiring capacitances, aswell asintuning inductances, affect theover-all receiver response much less; Thus the choice ofanintermediate fre- quency isacompromise.
FrequenciesII of30Me/see and 60Me/see have been chosen for most ofthe present-day ~ radar sets.
The i-famplifier band- width isnot animportant factor in the choice ofthe intermediate fre- quency.

Ani-famplifier consists ofanumber ofcascaded stages.
Figure 12.6 isacircuit diagram ofatype ofstage incommon use.
This isknown asasingle-tuned stage, since there isone tuning inductance per stage.
Ithas the advantage ofbeing simple, easy to manufacture and align, and noncritical inadjustment.
Itisparticularly useful ini-famplifiers ofover-all bandwidth less than 3Mc/see.
It becomes expensive atwider bandwidths, although animprovement in tube performance would raise this figure proportionately.
The inductance Listuned toresonate attheintermediate frequency with the combined output and input capacity plus stray capacity to ground due tosockets and wiring.
Itisplaced inthe grid circuit to provide alow-resistance path toground.
Thus, when the grid draws current during astrong signal, itdoes not accumulate abias; hence the gain isnot reduced and the amplifier remains sensitive toweak signals.

Hence thegain-bandwidth product is ~xa=~~ 2rc“(4) From Eq.
(4)wecansee thenecessity ofusing tubes with ashigha ratio oftransconductance toinput-plus-output capacitance aspossible.
The 6AK5 isslightly better than the6AC7 inthis respect, average tubes giving gain-bandwidth products ofapproximately 55Me/see and 50 Me/see, respectively,, when allowance ismade for socket and wiring capacity.
Onecanalso seefrom Eq.
(4)thenecessity ofkeeping extra- neous capacities toaminimum.
Itisforthis reason that theinductance Liseither fixed-tuned orslug-tuned, instead ofbeing used with atuning condenser.
Bythesame token, theuseofpoint-to-point wiring and the mounting ofcomponents onthetube sockets areclearly indicated.
Amplifiers with again of120dband anover-all i-fbandwidth ofabout 2Me/see will require astage bandwidth ofover 6Me/see, which permits again ofapproximately 7,or17db.
Thus seven stages will berequired.
Assuming ag~of7000, areasonable figure fora6AC7, theload resistance R.would be1000 ohms [Eq.
(2)].
Many more stages would berequired toincrease this bandwidth greatly, since the gain per stage must belowered.
The over-all band- width ofanamplifier consisting ofcascaded single-tuned stages isgiven approximately bytheformula Over-all bandwidth =single-stage bandwidth 1.2{n “(4) When n,thenumber ofcascaded stages, islarger than 3,this formula is quite accurate.
Thus the number ofsingle-tuned stages needed inanamplifier of given gain, even formoderately wide bandwidths, becomes prohibitively large.
Lacking better tubes, the only alternative liesintheuseofmore effective circuits.
Two things are needed: (1)acoupling circuit that will give agreater gain-bandwidth product foragiven tube, and (2)a response-vs.-frequency curve that, when cascaded, does not narrow as rapidly asthat given inEq.
(4).
The double-tuned (transformer- coupled) circuit does very well inthese respects.
The elements ofthe usual double-tuned circuit areshown inFig.

124 advantage that cascaded double-tuned circuits donot narrow asrapidfy ascascaded single-tuned circuits because ofthe rectangular form ofthe response curve (Fig.

For example, nine cascaded single-tuned stages, each of6-Me/see bandwidth, would have anover-all bandwidth of1.7Me/see.
However, nine cascaded double-tuned circuits, each 6 Me/see wide, would combine togive a3.2-Me/see over-all bandwidth.

This was accomplished with only nine 6AK5 tubes inthe i-famplifier (Sec.

Onthe other hand, there are disadvantages inusing double- tuned circuits.
They are difficult toalign, special equipment being required.
Though this can becircumvented tosome extent inwideband amplifiers bytheuseoffixed tuning, thesensitivity tovariations intube capacity and coil inductance ismuch greater than that ofsingIe-tuned circuits.
This isparticularly true when theloading isonone side only, sothat this arrangement isordinarily used only invery wideband ampli- fiers (15Me/see orover).
Another means ofachieving large bandwidth isbyusing stagger- tuned circuits.

The principle ofstagger tuning can becarried further.
Staggered triples (three different frequencies) areinfairly common use, and stag- gered n-uples are practicable forwideband amplifiers.
The advantage ofstagger-tuned amplifiers lies inthe fact that simple single-tuned cir- cuits areused throughout, afact that makes forease ofmanufacture and servicing.

Todetect signals barely visible above thenoise itisnecessary that thenoise originating intheinput circuit and thefirst stage beamplified toapoint where itiseasily visible ontheindi- cator.
How this gain will besplit between the i-fand video amplifiers depends upon such considerations assecond-detector efficiency and the complication involved inbuilding high-gain video amplifiers.
Inmost receivers thei-fgain isenough toamplify noise to1or2volts, thus bring- ingitinto the linear region where diode detectors have maximum effi- ciency.
This requires again ofaround 106times atthe intermediate frequency.
Building ani-famplifier with this gain while avoiding trouble with regenerative feedback hasbeen one ofthemost difficult problems in radar receiver design.
Ground current loops must beconfined bycareful bypassing and grounding; power leads must beproper] yfiltered; coils must bewound and spaced intelligently; theshielding must beadequate.
Careful attention must bepaid toallofthese items iftheover-all response characteristic istobear any resemblance towhat isexpected.

Video Arnpliliers.-One ormore stages ofvideo amplification follow thedetector.
The form ofthevideo amplifier isdetermined largely bvthenumber and location oftheindicator tubes.
Inanairborne radar setthere may beonly asingle indicator located near thereceiver, inwhich case the video amplifier isvery simple.
Inlarge ground and ship sets there will bemany indicators located farfrom thereceiver, and thevideo amplifiers must bemore complex.
Inthelatter case, thevideo amplifier following the detector drives aterminated line atalevel ofafew volts, and individual indicators are driven byvideo amplifiers bridged across this line.
The requirements placed onavideo amplifier can bestated quite generally.
1.Asignal ofafew volts from the detector must beamplified and transmitted totheindicator, thesignal level attheindicator being usually about 20volts, although some types ofindicator require a much higher voltage.
2.The amplifier must have good transient response, asdefined by thefollowing: itmust pass long pulses with little “droop” onthe top ofthe pulse; this requires good low-frequency response.
The risetimel must bedefinitely shorter than thepulse length, and the overshoot onapulse should beheld to10per cent orless; these factors are determined by the high-frequency response.

3.Some form oflimiting must beprovided.
The noise voltage at theoutput ofthedetector will beapproximately 2or3volts peak.
Inorder that thenoise beclearly visible onthescreen, itmust be amplified sufficiently todrive the indicator tube over something like half itsallowable control-grid voltage swing.
Since signal voltages from the detector may be20volts ormore, the output voltage must belimited sothat the indicator will not bedriven outside itsallowable range ofvoltage.

This issometimes difficult when large coupling condensers orlohg leads areinvolved.
There are other coupling networks that will increase the cutoff fre- quency and yet preserve the same gain.
Perhaps the simplest ofthese isthe “shunt peaking” circuit, which uses aninductance inseries with theload resistor, RP.Let theparameter Mbedefined bytheequation L=il{R2C.

This value ofMincreases the cutoff frequency toavalue of1.73 times that ofthesimple RCcircuit, but produces a2.5 percent overshoot onthepulse (the same amount asthat produced bya transitionally coupled i-fstage).
Still greater bandwidths can beobtained bytheuseofseries peaking’ oracombination ofseries and shunt peaking.

Inorder topreserve good response tolong pulses, itisnecessary that thetime constant ofthecoupling circuit, C,(RL+R.),bekept large com- pared totheduration ofthelongest blocks ofsignals involved.
Inthis event, thefractional amount ofdroop onthetop ofthelong pulse isjust theratio ofthepulse length tothecoupling time constant.
Thus ifthe time constant were 50,000 Pscc while thepulse length was 1000 l,sec, the pulse would droop 2per cent.
This isareasonably small amount, but ifthere were five such circuits incascade between the detector and the CRT, then thetotal amount ofdroop would be10percent.
Although itisfairly easy tomaintain such long time constants provided RL+R* islarge, occasionally ithappens that RL+Rgisfairly small.
This means that C.must belarge, which may result inalarge capacity to ground and affect the high-frequency response.
For example, al-~f condenser may have several hundred micromicrofarads ofcapacity toits shell.
Mounting thecondenser oninsulating posts isfrequently necessary insuch cases.
Another way ofreducing theamount ofdroop onthepulse isbyusing low-frequency compensation circuits.

However, even forR,=R.thetime forthepulse to fall to90per cent isincreased byafactor of5over the uncompensated network.
The limiting ofvideo output signal level isusually accomplished by applying negative video pulses tothe grid ofatube.
When the pulses are large enough todrive the tube tocutoff, the output pulse remains constant inamplitude, nomatter how much larger theinput pulses may be.

Itiswise tohave a limiter very early inthevideo amplifier, forthen thefollowing stages are protected from excessively large signals.
Self-bias isfrequently used inavideo amplifier, but, since acondenser ofsufficient capacity toprevent degeneration atthe lower frequencies would beprohibitive ylarge, such acondenser isusually omitted entirely inorder toassure uniform frequency response.
When the indicator issome distance from the receiver, the two are usually connected byaline terminated initscharacteristic impedance.
Unterminated lines have been used, but the high-frequency response is greatly impaired.
Although lines of1000-ohm characteristic impedance have been made and are fairly satisfactory forlengths of20ftorless, longer lines areusually standard 75-or100-ohm coaxial cable.
Todrive such aline from the plate ofanamplifier requires avery large coupling condenser; hence the cathode-follower circuit shown asthe second stage inFig.
12-10 isordinarily used (see Sec.
13.6).
Itschief advantage is that itcan bedirect-coupled.
Although the gain isconsiderably less than 1,this isnot appreciably less than would beobtained with aplate- coupled amplifier working into such alow impedance.
Following the line and bridged across itare the video amplifiers associated with each indicator.
Since these amplifiers can belocated very near tothe control electrode ofthe CRT, stray capacities can be kept very small.
These amplifiers can thus beeither grounded-grid or grounded-cathode, depending onthepolarity ofsignal desired.

However, forthe purposes ofthis chapter weneed only beconcerned with the i-famplifier, since weareinterested here in questions ofstability rather than inthe quality ofsignals.

The narrowest r-fcomponent, ahigh-Q TR switch, isso much wider than this that, once adjusted, nodrifts large enough tocause serious detuning are likely tooccur over aperiod ofaday orso.
The problem ofkeeping aradar intune, then, consists essentially inmaintain- ing the difference between the magnetron frequency and the local- oscillator frequency constant and equal tothe intermediate frequency, with anaccuracy of1Me/see orbetter.

Variations involtage, tem- perature, and pressure allproduce frequency changes.
Frequent tune-up bythe operator, using echoes, isnot dependable since serious deteriora- tion inthe sensitivity ofaradar, such asthat caused bydrifting out of tune, isnot immediately obvious onthe scope.

Inthe case ofbeacon reception, automatic frequency control main- tains the local oscillator atapredetermined frequency that ishigher or lower than the frequency ofthe distant beacon transmitter byjust the intermediate frequency.

These pulses areintegrated orotherwise converted toavoltage, which isapplied toacontrol electrode ofthelocal oscillator inthe proper sense topush the frequency toward the crossover ofthe discriminator curve.
This makes adegenerative feedback loop, and thefrequency ofthe local oscillator isheld very near the crossover point onthe curve.
Asshown inFig.
11.22 (Sec.
11.7), the voltage onthe reflector ofa reflex klystron ofthetype used asalocal oscillator tunes thetube over a range ofabout 30to70Me/see.
Some local oscillators arealso thermally tuned bymeans ofacontrol electrode which isthe grid ofanauxiliary triode.
This provides slow tuning over amuch wider frequency range (see Vol.

Inthesimplest type ofradar AFC, the integrated discriminator pulse output, suitably amplified, would godirectly tothereflector ofthelocal oscillator.
This “hold in” type ofAFC requires manual tuning each time the radar is turned on.

This circuit will find the correct frequency ifcrossover isanywhere within theelectronic tuning range ofthelocal oscillator.
Half asecond isatypical period ofone sawtooth search cycle.
The r-fpart ofthe block diagram shows adouble mixer that has separate crystals fortheradar and AFC functions, both receiving power from the radar local oscillator.
This permits the AFC crystal tobe operated atapredetermined power level.
The alternative-taking the AFC information from the output signal ofthe radar crystal arising from transmitter power that leaks through the TR switch-has been used but suffers from serious disadvantages.
The leakage power may be10to20times that desired formost favorable operation ofthecrystal, and isvariable from one TR tube toanother.
Aneven more serious difficulty iscaused bythe“spike” energy, which, because itoccurs asan extremely short pulse, contains avery wide range offrequency com- ponents.
Spurious frequencies present inthe spike mask the desired informat ion.
Asuccessful corrective hasbeen tosuppress thei-famplifier 456 THERECEIVING SYSTEM—RADAR RECEIVERS [SEC.
12.7 forthebeginning ofthepulse and toaccept asignal only from thelatter part.
This requires accurate timing and becomes very difficult for short pulses.
Asatisfactory operating level forthe AFC crystal is0.5 mw c-w power from thelocal oscillator and 1to2mwpulse powerfromthemag- netron.
Reduction ofthemagnetron power level by65to90dbbelow thetransmitted power isobtained byacombination ofweak coupling out ofthe main r-fline and anattenuator, preferably dissipative.
Itis important that ther-fsystem betight inorder toprevent leakage power, possibly many times that desired, from reaching the crystal bystray paths.
This becomes easier ifthe operating level ofthe AFC crystal is made ashigh asispermissible.
Ahigh operating level also requires less i-fgain ahead ofthediscriminator and thereby reduces theeffect ofgain variations.
Too high anoperating level is,however, undesirable because asthe crystal isdriven upto10mw orabove, itsaturates.
The harmonics of the difference frequency then become stronger relative tothe funda- mental.
For example, ifthediscriminator crossover issetat30Me/see, corresponding toani-famplifier centered atthat frequency, asecond harmonic at30Me/see large enough toactuate the control circuit and cause locking may appear when the local oscillator isonly 15Me/see away from the magnetron frequency, under conditions ofAFC crystal saturation.
The gain ofthe AFC feedback loop should behigh enough toinsure tight locking but not sohigh that the second harmonic can also cause locking.
Atthe recommended level of1to2mw ofmagnetron power theharmonics areatleast 20dbbelow thefundamental.
Again control isundesirable; therefore, care incontrolling the r-fpower levels and in amplifier design isrequired forafoolproof AFC.
The most frequent sources oftrouble areusually onther-fside rather than intheelectronic circuits, and arise from high power leakage into the crystal, faulty coupling tothemain line, orawrong amount ofattenuation.
Beacon Al’C.-To hold thebeacon local oscillator atagiven absolute frequency, some r-freference standard must beprovided, since themag- netron involved isinthebeacon, distant from theradar.
Atmicrowave frequencies the reference standard isaresonant cavity.
With proper attention todetails such astemperature compensation and moisture sealing, production-line cavities can bedepended upon tomaintain a specified frequency to1or2parts in10,000.

The derivative, shown dotted inFig.

This sweeps the local-oscillator frequency over arange that may beatenth ofthe half-power bandwidth ofthe cavity.
The crystal output then has an amplitude modulation ofmagnitude proportional tothe slope ofthe cavity resonance curve atthefrequency inquestion.
The phase ofthis amplitude modulation depends onwhether the slope ispositive ornega- tive.

Protection against Extraneous Radiations.
Antijamming.— Although the sensitivity ofaradar repeiver isnormally limited bythe noise produced inthereceiver, extraneous radiation may beoccasionally picked uponthe radar antenna.
Such radiation may, forexample, be theresult oftheoperation ofother microwave equipment inthevicinity.
Itisgood design practice toprotect against such interference, and, as will beseen later, the same provisions are sometimes ofvalue inthe absence ofinterference.
These AJ (antijamming) provisions may merely beprecautions taken inthe design ofthe receiver which donot affect itsnormal operation, orthey may bespecial AJcircuits that can be switched inand out ofuse.
Interference may beany ofseveral types such asCW, amplitude- modulated CW, frequency-modulated CW, r-fpulses, ornoise-modulated C!W, The more nearly the interference islike theechoes being received 458 THERECEIVING SYSTEM—RADAR RECEIVERS [SEC.
12% orlike the noise produced inthe receiver, the more difficult itistodis- criminate against.
One type ofinterference that must beguarded against is“hash,” from rotating machinery and steep pulse wavefronts, which may leak into the i-famplifier.
Strict attention must bepaid toshielding, and allleads into thereceiver must beproperly filtered and bypassed, Perhaps the most fundamental AJ provisions are those that will permit thereceiver tooperate inthepresence ofconsiderable amounts of c-w power.
Ifthe second detector isdirectly coupled tothe video amplifier, then avery small amount RFC 51##f ofc-w signal will develop enough voltage across thedetector tobias the first video stage outofitsoperating range.
This can beavoided byde- veloping anequal amount ofcounter- bias, orbycoupling the detector to2nd detector thevideo amplifier through ablock- Fm.

ingcondenser.
The latter course is much simpler and usually isthe one adopted.
The receiver WN now continue tofunction inthepresence ofa c-w simal until the i-famplifier isoverloaded.
The i-foverload limit can beincreased byopera~ing the last stage ortwo with higher plate- supply voltage.
Frequently apower tube, such asthe 6AG7, isused in the last stage toincrease the output capabilities ofthe i-famplifier, although the6AK5 has proven fairly satisfactory inthis application.
A rather wide video bandwidth (atleast aswide asthetotal i-fbandwidth) isnecessary when thefrequent yofthejamming signal isnotthesame as that oftheradar transmitter.
Use ofalinear detector will also give the i-famplifier agreater dynamic range.
Insome receivers itisnecessary toapply a“gate,” which sensitizes thereceiver during acertain interval oftime.
Itisdesirable that such gating betione inthe video amplifier rather than inthe i-famplifier, toavoid generating apulse when ac-w signal ispresent.
Finally, theoperation ofthegain control early inthe i-famplifier isofvalue when strong c-w signals arepresent.
The gain control should beofatype that does not reduce the output capabilities ofthecent rolled stages; grid gain cent rolissatisfactory inthis respect.
The precautions mentioned thus farconstitute good design practice and canwell beincluded inany radar receiver.
Toprotect against either frequency- oramplitude-modulated c-w signals, such precautions arestill necessary but not quite sufficient.
Inaddition, there isneeded between the detector and video amplifier afilter that will pass individual pulses but not the c-w modulation frequencies.
Several types offilter have been tried; thesimplest isthefast time constant (FTC) circuit shown in Fig.
12.14. SEC.
128]PROTECTION AGAINST EXTRANEOUS RADIATIONS 459 With the switch inthe position shown, the time constant ofthe coupling circuit is10,000 psec sothat moderately long blocks ofsignal will bepassed.
With the switch reversed, the time constant is1~sec sothat individual pulses will bepassed with some differentiation; long pulses and modulation frequencies below 20kc/see will begreatly atten- uated.
Even for modulation frequencies ashigh as200 kc/see, the circuit has considerable effect.
Itshould, therefore, beswitched inonly when interference makes itnecessary.
Toplateoflasti.fstage + 1 Ifamplifier v FIG.12.15.—Instantaneous automatic gain control.
Differentiation circuits, ofwtilchthe FTC circuit described above isa good example, areofreal value solong asthe i-famplifier isnot over- loaded.
When overloading occurs, the gain ofthe receiver must be ‘ reduced.
Aslong asthejamming signal isconstant inamplitude, manual gain control isavery satisfactory means ofaccomplishing thegain reduc- tion.
However, ifthe radar antenna isscanning orthe c-w signal is modulated, manual control ismuch too slow tobeeffective.
For this reason, various schemes forreducing the gain automatically and rapidly have been devised.
These arevariously called “instantaneous automatic gain control (IAGC),” “amplified back-bias,” “back-bias,” etc.
The circuit shown inFig.
12.15 shows the essential elements ofanIAGC circuit.
Signals appearing atthe output terminals ofthe last i-fstage are rectified bythedetector and applied asanegative voltage tothegrid of thecathode follower, which inturn controls the grid bias ofone ofthe i-famplifiers insuch away that the presence ofasignal tends tolower thei-fgain.
The time required forthis reduction ingain totake place is determined bytheconstants ofthecircuits, aswell asbythestrength of thesignal.
Inthe particular example shown, this time isafew micro- seconds, sothat thegain isnot appreciably reduced byasingle pulse but isctitdown bylong blocks ofsignals orbyac-w signal modulated ata low frequency.
The detector shown inFig.
12.15 may beeither the normal signal.

The output ofthe IAGC circuit may befedback tothegrid ofthelast stage ortothat ofthepreceding stage.
(Instability results from feeding back across too many stages.) When 460 THE RECEIVING SYSTEM—RADAR RECEIVERS [SEC.
12.8 itisnecessary toprevent earlier stages from becoming overloaded, they can beshunted byanother similar loop.
The gain ofthefeedback 100p can beincreased either byusing aplate detector instead ofadiode, orby converting the cathode follower into ad-c amplifier.
With asingle feedback loop over two i-fstages, theloss insignal detectability resulting from a60-db c-w jamming signal isonly 12db.
Although considerable thought and effort have gone into theproblem ofdesigning areceiver that can discriminate against more complex types ofinterference (pulses and noise), this isamuch more difficult problem which will notbetreated here.
1 Anticlutter Circuits.
—Land, rough sea, and storm clouds reflect a considerable amount ofr-fenergy and can, therefore, interfere ~vith the detection ofobjects inthe area they occupy.
Ifthe desired signal is \veaker than the “clutter” from the land, sea, orcloud, itisdifficult to modify thereceiver todiscriminate against theclutter; forthefrequencies contained inthe clutter echoes are inthe same range asthose ofthe desired signals.
If,onthe other hand, the signal return islarger than theclutter, itshould bepossible toseethesignal.
However, thesignal can bemissed iftheclutter issostrong astosaturate thereceiver com- pletely.
This can beavoided byreducing therccciver gain tothepoint where theclutter isbelow saturation.
Such aprocedure would besatis- factory ifthecl~ltter ]vere everywhere uniform, which itnever is.
There- fore, ifthegain isreduced tothepoint required bystrong clutter, itwill betoolow forregions ofless ornoclutter, and wcafi signals ~rill still be lost.
The IAGC circuit previously described is~’ery ~aluable under such conditions and has been included inmany receivers primarily forthis reason.
Inthecase ofseareturn, theclutter isfairly constant atallazimuths.
Also, theamount ofseareturn isasteadily decreasing function ofrange.
Itispossible todevise acircuit that lo\vew thereceiver gain immediately following thetransmitter pulse and then increases it~teadily, arriving at maximum gain atthe time the sea return has disappeared.
This is kno~vn asa“sensitivity y-time-control (STC) circuit”; ithas the disad- vantage that controls must beprovi{ded toadjust itforvarying seacondi- tions.
N-evertheless, STC has proven ofconsiderable value atsea, and hasalso been wed onsome ground-based radar sets \vhere control ofair- craft close tothesetisdesired.

AGeneral-purpose Receiver.
—This receiver was designed aspart ofa3-cm radar setinstalled onsmall ocean-going vessels forsea- search and navigational purposes.
The receivers built intoa steel box which fitsinto ther-fhead.
The general construction and layout can be seen from Fig.
12.16.
Separate AFC and signal mixers areincorporated inthe receiver; the choke joints forconnection tothe r-fsystem can be seen intheside view.
Ashutter issho\vn across one ofthewaveguides in the position itoccupies when the transmitter isoff.
This shutter pro- vides crystal protection against signals picked uponthe antenna when theTR switch isnotfiring.
At~heother end ofthereceiver areavideo- output jack and aterminal strip forbringing inpower and certain control voltages.
The local oscillator isa723A/B klystron.
Itsupplies r-fpower to both the AFC mixer and the signal mixer.
Itsfrequency can bevaried over awide range bymechanical tuning and over asmaller range by varying the reflector voltage.
Except forthe common local oscillator, the receiver isdivided into two portions, the AFC channel and the signal channel (see Fig.
12.17).
The latter consists ofsixi-famplifier stages, adetector, and avideo stage.
Each stage ofi-famplification uses a6AC7 pentode with single- tuned coupling circuits.
Allstages but the last have a1200-ohm load resistance, 1giving asingle-stage bandwidth ofalittle over 6lIc/sec and anover-all i-fband~\-idth ofnearly 2Me/see.
The nominal gain ofthe i-famplifier is120 db.
A6H6 diode second detector iscapacitively coupled into asingle video stage.
The video stage serves asacombined line driver and limiter.
It ~perates asacathode follower, the cathode resistance of100 ohms being located attheend ofthevideo line.
The screen voltage issetatsuch a value that thetube draws approximately 10maofcurrent with nosignal; this puts 1volt across the 100-ohm line.
N“egative signals from the detector may drive thegrid tocutoff, thereby reducing the cathode volt- age tozero.
The video signals atthe cathode are then negative and limited to1volt inamplitude.
The gain ofthei-famplifier isadjusted byvarying thevoltage onthe grid ofthesecond and third stages bymeans ofanexternal control.

Lightweight Airborne Receiver.
~This receiver ispart ofa lightweight 3-cm airborne radar (AN/APS-10) intended primarily for navigation.
Itwas designed torequire aminimum offield test equip- ment and aminimum number ofhighly trained service personnel.
Accordingly, asfaraspossible the system was divided into small units that could bereplaced, rather than repaired, inthefield.
The receiver isdistributed among several subunits, which, except for thevideo amplifiers, areenclosed (along with ther-fcomponents, trans- mitter, modulator, and most ofthepower supplies) inapressurized con- tainer forming one ofthemajor units ofthesystem.
These subunits of thereceiver arethefollo\ving: 1.Aunit containing adouble crystal, mounts for723A/B radar and beacon local oscillators, and a1ow-Q reference cavity forthebeacon ~AFC.
2.AnAFC unit forboth radar and beacon local oscillators.

4.Power supply.
The receiver supplies low-level video signals toeither one ortwo cathode- ray tubes, each ofm-hich isequipped with avideo amplifier.
The i-famplifier, aschematic view ofwhich isshown inFig.

The noise figure determined from measuring approximately 100 such amplifiers ranged from 1.7to4.5db,with the a}-erage at3.3db.
This amplifier was designed before the development ofthe grounded-cathode grounded-grid triode input circuit.
The use ofsuch aninput circuit would require one more tube orthe equivalent thereof.

The sides ofthethin stainless steel cover are held byspecial springs atthe edge ofthe chassis.
Inorder toobtain stability, itwas necessary toprovide thechassis with two baffles toreduce feedback.
These consist ofsmall pieces ofsheet metal fastened tothe chassis and making cent actwiththe.bottomofthecover.
Good contact between thebottom ofthecover and thebaffles isobtained bytheuseof screws which pass through thecover and aretapped into thebaffles.
The i-fstrip requires apower supply giving 65ma at+105 volts unregulated for plates and screens, 1.4 amperes at6.3 volts a-c for heaters, and avoltage variable from Oto–10volts (with asource 468 THERECEIVING SYSTEM—RADAR RECEIVERS [SEC.

The video amplifiers forthe cathode-ray tubes (Fig.

The input signal is–1volt peak; the amplifier output supplies —30volts peak tothecathode oftheindicator tube.
The half-power bandwidth is4Me/see.
The chassis also contains a6AL5 dual-diode tube.
One half ofthis tube isused inacircuit tolengthen the duration ofbeacon reply pulses and sogive abrighter spot ontheCRT screen.
Ontherise ofthepulse thediode conducts, and theinput capacity ofthe second tube ischarged rapidly.
When the amplitude ofthe pulse starts todecrease, the diode nolonger conducts, and the charge onthe grid ofthe second tube leaks away S1OW1 ythrough a2.2-megohm resist or.
The other half ofthe6AL5 isused asad-crestorer forthecathode-ray tube.
This amplifier ismounted onachassis having theform ofanannular ring which fits around the neck ofthe cathode-ray tube.
The power supply requirements are20maat+140volts forplates and screens, and 0.5amp at6.3volts forheaters.
Automatic- frequency-control Circuit.-The AFC subunit provides automatic control ofthe radar and beacon local-oscillator frequencies.
The schematic view oftheeight-tube circuit isshown inFig.
12.21.
Both search and beacon AFC systems areofthesearch-and-lock type (Sec.

Asawtooth generated bythe recovery ofthe grid circuit ofablocking oscillator, V5, sweeps the reflector voltage and thus the frequency ofaklystron.
Inradar operation, i-fsignals from aseparate AFC crystal areamplified byV,and applied tothediscriminator formed byVaand associated circuits, which iscentered at30.Mc/sec.
The out- put pulses from the discriminator areamplified inV~and applied tothe grid ofthe thyratron Vq.
When the pulses change sign and become positive atthe crossover, they trigger thethyratron and stop the sweep voltage.
Inbeacon operation, power istransferred from the search local oscillator tothebeacon local oscillator, which (asdescribed inSec.

Asmall 1000-cycle sinusoidal modulation, supplied byoscillator VE,issuperimposed onthe sawtooth applied tothe reflector.

This phase shift isdetected inthe phase-comparison tube VT byapplying theamplified crystal output tothecontrol grid and theaudio oscillator output tothesuppressor grid.
Both grids arebiased tocutoff, sothat nocurrent flows inthetube unless thesignals areinphase.
The circuit issoarranged that the 180° shift inphase oftheaudio signal pro- duces phase agreement, thereby providing pulses ofplate current on alternate half cycles oftheaudio signal.
These pulses, further amplified inVs,then trigger thyratron V4tostop thesweep.
The change from search tobeacon operation isperformed remotely byrelays which switch the grid input toV~, switch from the reflector voltage-control potentiometer PItoPz, change over the plate power from thesearch tothebeacon local oscillator, and superpose thesinusoidal modulation onthesawtooth.
Switch S1enables amaintenance man totune the local oscillators manually tothe proper frequencies forsignal reception with P1and Pt (for the search orbeacon local oscillators respectively), and then to revert toAFC operation centered atthecorrect frequency.
This switch isspring-loaded sothat the circuit cannot beleft onmanual tuning.
Jacks areprovided at“which the radar AFC crystal current and the beacon AFC crystal current can bemeasured.
Apin-jack test point is provided atthegrid ofVstoaidinaligning thediscriminator, and another atthe plate ofVsforchecking the control signals tothethyratron.
This AFC unit requires apower source supplying 5maat+300 volts, 23.5 maat+105 volts, 2maat–300 volts, 1.55 amp at6.3volts, and 0.8 amp at6.3volts at—225 volts from ground.
N’one ofthese voltages needs toberegulated, although the plate voltages must bewell filtered.

An Extremely Wideband Receiver.—The receiver shown in Figs.
12.22 and 12.23 isagood example ofadesign forareceiver having a very wide bandwidth.
Itwas designed fora3-cm radar system with a O.l~psec pulse width.
Inorder toreproduce such short pulses and still maintain agood signal-to-noise ratio, ani-fbandwidth ofatleast 10 Me/see isrequired; thebandwidth ofthereceiver is12.5 Me/see.
The i-famplifier consists of12stages, 6A’K5 tubes being used inall but the second.
The intermediate frequency is60Me/see, the total gain being approximately 120 db.
Anintermediate frequency of60Me/see instead of30Me/see was chosen fortwo reasons.
First, fairly tight coupling isrequired between the primary and secondary ofthe i-ftransformers toattain wide band- widths.
Itiseasier tomake this coupling tight at60Me/see than at 30Me/see.
Second, the AFC operation ismore certain atthe higher frequency.

This can becounted ononly when theintermediate frequency ishigh.
Double-tuned circuits were chosen inpreference tostagger-tuned, because itwas felt that they would give asmaller change intheshape of theresponse curve foragiven change intube capacity.
The circuits were loaded onboth sides toreduce still further thesensitivity totube-capacity changes.
Equal values ofprimary and secondary Qwould have been best inthis respect; actually acompromise Q-ratio of2.2was adopted togive alittle more gain than equal Q’swould provide.
The transformer coils arewound adjacent toeach other onapowdered-iron core togive tight coupling.
Athin spacer between thetwo coils isofsuch thickness astomake thecoupling just transitional.
The gain perstage isapproxi- mately 11db,and the single-stage bandwidth 25Me/see.
The 6AK5 tube ischosen inpreference tothe 6AC7 because itis smaller, takes less power, and hasasmaller variation ininput and output capacity.
Italso gives abetter receiver noise figure when used in,the first stage.
A6J6 isused inthesecond stage because ofitslow plate-to- cathode capacity, animportant factor ingrounded-grid triode operation.
The first two stages areoperated astriodes; inspite ofthehigh inter- mediate frequency and thebroad bandwidth, ani-fnoise figure of3.5db can usually beattained.
Both signal and AFC mixers are ofthe balanced type.
This effec- tively cancels out local-oscillator noise and pi-ovides good isolation between the two channels.
There aretwo crystals ineach mixer, pro- vision being made formonitoring thecurrent ineach ofthefour crystals.
The local oscillator isa2K25 klystron, which can betuned mechani- cally over alarge range and electrically over arestricted range ofsome 30Me/see.
The electrical tuning can bedone manually, bymeans ofa remote potentiometer, orautomatically.
The AFC circuit operates asfollows.
The beat frequency obtained bymixing asmall part ofthe transmitter power with local-oscillator power isamplified bytwo i-fstages and then applied tothediscriminator.
The video pulses from the disitiminator undergo one stage ofamplifica- tion before reaching thecontrol tube, Vb(Fig.

Tube VCgenerates asawtooth sweep which moves thereflector voltage ofthelocal oscillator through arange determined bythesetting ofRte; thesweep isstopped at thecorrect voltage toreceive signals bythefiring ofthe control tube.
The video amplifier consists ofalimiter-amplifier stage which drives a cathode follower operating into aline terminated with 75ohms.
Limited signals of1.5volts amplitude appear across theline.

12,11 CHAPTER 13 THE RECEIVING SYSTEM—INDICATORS BYL.J.HAWORTH THE CATHODE-RAY TUBE The effectiveness ofacathode-ray tube asaradar indicator isinflu- enced byanumber offactors, among them: (1)thesize ofthetube face; (2)theintensity ofthe emitted light, which isdetermined byboth the strength ofthe electron beam and the efficiency ofthe screen; (3)the decay properties ofthe screen and the manner inwhich itintegrates repeated signals; (4)theresolution; (5)the grid-modulation characteris- tics; (6)theeffect ofthetube ontheover-all complexity, weight, size, and power dksipation ofthecomplete indicating equipment.
These properties arenotindependent, and inmany cases acompromise among them must bereached.
Asaresult ofthevariety ofoperational demands alarge number oftypes oftubes have been developed.
The next few sections describe some oftheir salient features.
13.1.
Electrical Properties ofCathode-ray Tubes.—Cathode-ray tubes areclassified as“electrostatic” or“magnetic” inaccordance with themethod ofdeflection.
Anexample ofeach isgiven inFig.
13.1.
The electron beam originates inahot cathode attheend ofthetube remote from thescreen.
Intraversing thetube itisacted upon byanumber of electrostatic, orelectrostatic and magnetic, fields which serve tocontrol and focus it.
The beam iscollimated and controlled inintensity bythe “control grid, ”apierced diaphragm immediately infront oftheflat oxide-coated cathode.
Inmost American tubes a“second grid” atapositive poten- tial ofafew hundred volts serves toattract theelectrons from thesDaceL charge inmuch the same way asdoes the screen grid inanordinary tetrode orpentode.
The electrons aregiven their final high velocity by apotential difference ofafew thousand volts maintained between the cathode and ananode formed byaconducting coating ofcarbon (Aquadag) ontheinner surface oftheglass atthescreen end ofthetube.
Focusing can beeither electrostatic ormagnetic.
Asindicated in Fig.

Thevarious electrodes aresoshaped that strong electron lens actions areproduced bythefieldsat thetwo gaps.
Adjust- ment offocus ismade bycontrolling thepotential ofthefocus electrode.
Magnetic focusing isaccomplished bymeans ofalongitudinal mag- netic field ofcircular symmetry which increases inintensity fromthe center totheedge ofthetube and thus has radial components that help provide the focusing action.
External coils orpermanent magnets are used toproduce this field.

The deflection due toeach pair isaccurately proportional tothe potential difference between itsmembers.
The individual deflections due tothe two pairs ofplates add vectorially.
The deflection sensitivity atthe screen depends upon the geometry ofthe deflecting plates themselves, their distance from the screen, and the velocity ofthe electrons asthey pass the plates.
The two pairs aresimilar ingeometry, but, since they are atdifferent distances from the screen, their deflection sensitivities are unequal.
Inthe electrostatic tube shown, the electrons achieve their final velocity before reaching the deflecting plates.
Insome tubes designed for high-voltage use, deflection sensitivity isincreased byapplying SEC.

Magnetic deflection isaccomplished bypassing currents ofthedesired waveforms through acoil orcombination ofcoils surrounding the tube neck (Fig.

Itisthen worth while tousetwo separate coils ora permanent magnet and asingle coil.
Iftwo coils are used, they are usually placed together (on the same yoke when iron isused), but in extreme cases they must beseparated toavoid interaction.
Arotating coil and afixed coil can beused incombination—for example, toproduce anoff-center PPI.
The fixed coil isplaced outside ofthe rotating one, which must then contain noiron.
The outer unit may contain asingle coil that can bemanually oriented, oritmay have two orthogonal coils that can beseparately excited.
Ifthe amount of off-centering istoremain fixed, apermanent-magnet arrangement can replace theouter coil.
Inthe specific design ofthe coils many factors must beconsidered.
They should beaseconomical ofover-all power aspossible.
The mag- netic fields must besoihaped that they produce alinear deflection and cause noharmful effects onfocus.
When multiple coils areused, itrn.ust bepossible toprevent harmful effects from interaction.
The current sensitivity ofthe coils should bemade ashigh asprac- ticable since this minimizes power losses.
For agiven geometry, the sensitivity isdirectly proportional tothe number ofturns, which should therefore beashigh aspracticable.
However, foragiven rate ofdeflec- tion (i.e., agiven rate ofchange offlux) thevoltage induced inthecoil is directly proportional tothenumber ofturns.
This usually sets anupper limit tothe number ofturns that can beused within the bounds ofa reasonable power supply voltage.
These and other matters pertaining tocoil design are discussed at length inVol.

Cathode-ray Tube Screens.
Phosphorescent Screens.—The important characteristics ofthe screen areitsdecay properties, itseffi- ciency, and themanner inwhich itintegrates or“builds up” onrepeated signals.
When scanning interrupts thepicture, thescreen must have sufficient persistence (’(afterglow”) topermit observations and measurements on theechoes and insofaraspossible tofurnish acontinuous picture.
On theother hand, theimage must not persist solong astocause confusion onachanging picture.
Interms ofthe scanning rate, three cases may beconsidered: 1.Cases inwhich little ornopersistence isneeded, either because the frame time isless than theretentivity time oftheeye (about ~see) orbecause observations are made inthe absence ofscanning.

3.Applications inwhich the scanning issoslow that considerable persistence isneeded toafford viewing time and toprovide acom- posite picture.
This classification covers scanning rates from a few per second uptoone ortwo perminute; itincludes the bulk ofpresent-day radars with theexception offire-control equipment.
Long-persistence phosphors have better buildup and decay properties under weak excitation than under strong excitation.
LTnfortunately the extremely thin layer penetrated byelectrons ofcathode-ray tube energies must bestrongly excited toprovide enough total light.
Onthe other hand, ifexcitation bylight could beused theexcitation density could be kept very low because thescreen would beexcited throughout.
Thk is accomplished bythe simple but exceedingly clever expedient ofcover- ingthepersistent screen with asecond layer ofablue-emitting phosphor which undergoes primary excitation bythe electrons.
The blue light from this layer inturn excites the persistent screen.
This process results inconsiderably lower over-all efficiencies than those ofthesingle- layer screens.
Two varieties ofsuch “cascade” screens arecommercially available inthis country.
The P-14 issuitable forframe times uptoavery few seconds, and the P-7 has amuch longer persistence (Fig.

The decay ofthese cascade screens isaninverse power rather than an exponential function ofthetime, sothat thedisappearance ofoldsignals isless clean-cut than with the P-1 and P-12 types.
Unfortunately no phosphors with exponential decays ofmore than about 100-msec time constant have asyetbeen developed.
Itisdifficult toobtain sufficient light from intensity-modulated dis- plays during scanning, since each point onthetube isexcited only inter- mittently.
The problem isespecially acute onthe slower scans, partly because ofthe long time “between excitations and partly because the cascade screens areless efficient than those with less persistence.
Inintensity-modulated displays thecharacteristics ofthescreen have important effects onthe signal-to-noise discernibility y.
As has been pointed outinChap.
2,theenergy perpulse necessary foranecho tobe just discernible isinversely proportional tothesquare root ofthenumber ofpulses included inthe observation.
From this standpoint the screen should enable the operator tointegrate oraverage over the maximum number ofpulse cycles consistent with other requirements; theintensity ofeach spot should represent the average ofalltheexcitations received over avery long time inthepast.
The limits within which this can be accomplished aresetbytheachievable properties ofthe screen, and by thedegree towhich past information can beretained without causing confusion asthepicture changes.
The screen properties ofimportance inthis connection arethe type ofdecay and themanner inwhich thelight intensity “builds up” under successive excitations.
Toexamine their effects, consider first ascan which issoslow that either the limitations ofachievable persistence or therequirements offreedom from display confusion due totarget motion prevent appreciable storage ofinformation from one scan tothe next.
Insuch acase, the averaging must bedone over asingle pulse group.
With modern narrow antenna beams and customary scanning rates the time occupied bythis group isalways short compared with the total scanning time and achievable decay times.
The screen chosen should have sufficient persistence sothat there isnoappreciable decay’ during theprocess ofscanning across thetarget and theentire echo arcisobserv- able atone time.
Inorder that the average intensity ofthis arcshall represent allofthedata, itisessential that thescreen integrate theeffects ofallthepulses that overlap onagiven focal spot—that is,itshould not 1Except forthat involved inthedisappearance ofthesecalled “flash,” which occurs foravery short time interval during andimmediately after each excitation. 482 THERECEIVIA’GSYSTEM-INDICATORS [SEC.132 saturate too quickly.

Thus fora30-sec scan and aPRF of400 (see Sec.

tube, since S/r =~.
The property of“building up” inintensity because ofexcitation bysuccessive members ofsuch agroup ofpulses ispossessed toanadequate degree byallcascade screens, pro- viding theexcitation isnot attoohigh alevel.
Atfaster scanning rates itbecomes possible toprovide screens having carry-over from one scan tothenext.
Within the requirements setby clarity inachanging picture, the longest obtainable persistence should usually beused inorder toaverage over thelargest possible number of pulses.
However, the permissible decay time issoshort inthe case of very rapid scans that the operator and not the screen has the longer memory.
The persistence should then bedetermined entirely bythe requirements offreedom from flicker ontheone hand and freedom from blurring due tomotion onthe other.’ Ifasethas several indicators involving different scale factors, their persistence should theoretically begraded, fast screens being used onthe expanded displays where the picture changes rapidly and slower ones onthose displays covering large areas.
Fortunately, itisusually thelatter onwhich thesignal-to-noise discernibility isofmost importance ,since the expanded displays are usually confined tonear-by regiens.
Providing thescanning isnot too slow (for example, ifitisapproxi- mately one scan per second) certain types ofcascade screens will, if initially unexcited, display more than twice asmuch intensity after two scans asafter one, and soon,e~”en though theintensity may have decayed manyfold inthetime between scans.
This property of“supernormal” buildup was atone time believed tobevery desirable from the signal- discernibility standpoint, onthe hypothesis that itwould give the repeating signal anadvantage over random noise.
However, theprop- erty ismost exaggerated onaninitially unexcited screen, whereas in actual cases ofsuccessive scan integration the screen isinitially excited from previous scans.
Furthermore, itisnot evident apriori that the 1When extended observations aretobemade cmasingle target orregion the display issometimes “frozen”; th~t is,thetarget motion relative totheradar iscom- pensated sothat thepicture remains stationary.
Itisthen possible touselonger persistence without blurring.

Inany case, careful observation has notdetected any appreciable advantage forscreens with very high super- normal buildup.
The property ofsupernormal buildup may becon- nected, however, withother desirable ones.
Indeed, those screens with highest buildup areingeneral theones that show thelongest persistence.

“Dark Trace” S’creen.s.--Certain normally white salts, notably the alkali halides such asKC1, have theproperty ofdarkening foratime ata point where they have been struck byanelectron beam ofsufficient energy.

Bymeans ofanintense external light source, opaque projection ofthe tube face magnified several diameters ispossible.
Although ofvalue forthis purpose, this type ofscreen has several dis- advantages.
Contrast isalways low, particularly iftheduty ratio ofthe pulses islow.
Furthermore, such ascreen has the unhappy property that signals tend to“burn in” with time, which isadefinite handicap inachanging picture and isdisastrous inthepresence ofcertain forms of interference.
Except fortheburning-in tendency, thenormal persistence issatisfactory through about the same scan intervals asisthat ofthe P-7screen.

4.The grid-modulation characteristic ofmost electrostatic tubes follows approximately asquare law, whereas that oftheguns used inmost magnetic tubes iscubic.
Ascompared with alinear response, these characteristics have the unfortunate property of lowering the dynamic range ofusable echo intensities since they reduce the ratio between the upper limit ofuseful signal swing, setbythe tendency todefocus, and the level below which the intensity isinsufficient.

Asaresult ofthese factors, electrostatic tubes areinvariably used for deflection-modulated indicators, but, except incases ofextreme weight limitation, magnetic tubes areused formost intensity-modulated displays.

Onthe other hand, ifgeometrical measurements orestimates are tobe made, orifplotting istobedone, itisdesirable tohave asmuch dis- persion aspossible; forsuch usethelarger sizes aredefinitely preferable.
This requirement must bebalanced against theavailable space, particu- larly inairborne equipment.
For many purposes even thelargest available tubes (lZ-in.

Since atmost scanning rates phosphorescent screens donot provide enough light forprojection, itisnecessary todevise special methods.
Of those used todate, one involves the projection ofaphotograph ofthe PPI orother scope, which isdeveloped and projected inafew seconds by special techniques; theother involves opaque projection from theskiatron screen (see Sec.

Angle-data Transmitters.—Thc devices that provide the scanner data are known as“(angle) data transmitters.” ‘~hey in- SEC.
13.4] ANGLE-DATA TRANSMITTERS 487 elude potentiometers, variable transformers, variable condensers, and generators.
Potentiometers.
-Potentiometers are principally used toprovide voltages whose only frequency components arethose resulting from the scanning.
Because even thebest potentiometers have acertain amount ofbrush ‘(jitter” which can beremoved only byfiltering, they arenot very satisfactory forresolving range sweeps.
Awide variety oflinear potentiometers differing inaccuracy, size, ruggedness, and soonhave been developed specifically forradar use (see Vol.
17).1 For many pur- poses they provide the simplest method ofdata transmission and often they are more effective than any other device.
Adifficulty arises, however, inthose cases where itisnecessary toshift the sector under view.
This can bedone within limits byadding afixed voltage tothe circuit, but over any extended angle itisnecessary tointroduce theshift mechanically byusing adifferential gear orbyrotating the body of thepotentiometer.
This requires either that thepotentiometer benear theoperator orthat aremote mechanical control beprovided.
Since the second method iscostly, some other data-transmission system isusually chosen inpreference.
Several varieties ofpotentiometer have been made with sine orwith sine and cosine characteristics, foruseasresolvers (Vol.
17).
These have been designed with great care and arefairly good atlow turning rates and low signal frequencies.
Asdata transmitters they areoccasionally used forpurposes ofpre-time-base resolution onslowly scanning systems, orasabasis ofinformation forcomputers.
Variable Transformers (Resolvers, Synchros, etc.).—Figure 13.6a illus- trates theprinciple ofcertain variable transformers called “resolvers,” ‘‘synchros, ““selsyns, ““autosyns, ”and soon,which are widely used asposition-data transmitters.
Aniron-cored coil (rotor) ofspecial shape ismounted onafreely turning axis inside aslotted-iron framework much likeamotor stator.
Two orthree stator coils aresymmetrically wound into theslots insuch away that the coupling ofeach with the rotor is proportional tothe sine ofthe rotor angle measured with respect toa position ofzero coupling.
The device thus fulfills therequirements ofa resolver fora-csignals.
Animportant aspect ofthis process isthat the polarity oftheoutput signal atagiven phase oftheinput signal reverses asthesynchro passes through anull position forthat particular secondary winding.
Ifthe stators ofanexcited resolver, called the “transmitter,” are loaded with thestators ofasecond, called the” repeater” orthe” receiver,” (Fig.

The 2-phase resolver hasbeen used innearly allpractical applications ofthe resolved-sweep technique to“electronic” PPI’s and RHI’s (Fig.

For many purposes a3-phase rather thana 2-phasel device isused.
Ifequal loads areapplied across thethree phases thesum ofcurrents in thethree stators iszero.
Thus, ifthisrestriction isimposed, three brushes and three wires can beeliminated bymaking aYconnection.
Ifa synchro with a2-phase rotor isused asareceiver, itsinduced voltages 1Inthissense theword “phase” refers torotation oftherotor rather than tothe internal phase ofanysignal being transmitted.

As resolvers where thevoltage itself istobeused, they have thedisadvantage that they donot deliver rectangular “components.” Ifonly one com- ponent isneeded, however, asinatype Bortype Cdisplay (using the approximation sine=O)they areoften used because oftheir somewhat higher accuracy and their greater availability.

Rotating -coil-indicator techniques cannot beused insuch applications; hence the display must besynthe- sized electrically.
The form ofsignal modulation provided byasynchro issuitable only for those sector widths forwhich the discontinuity inthe scan can beachieved by switching between stator leads (that is,90°, 180°, etc.
fora2-phase, 120° for a3-phase synchro).
Poten- tiometers cannot beused forrapid scans, since brush” chatter” becomes excessive and thelifeisexceedingly short.
To fill this need, special variable condensers have been devel- oped.
An example ofsuch acon- denser and onetype ofcircuit used is shown inFig.

The condenser plates aresoshaped that thecapacity increases astherotor turns clock- wise, producing thedesired potential variation (usually linear with angle) across C’O.

Generators.
—In some instances ofconical orspiral scanning, part of chescanner data isprovided bymeans ofad-cexcited 2-phase generator geared directly tothescanner axis.
Inthecase ofconical scanning, the output voltages ofthis generator are direct measures ofthe sine and cosine ofthe phase ofthe scan.
Inthe spiral scan, the voltages are modulated interms ofthe nod angle, either byvarying the generator field current byapotentiometer onthe nod shaft, orbypassing each sinusoidal voltage through such apotentiometer after generation.
The signals thus produced can beused directly inthesynthesis oftype Band type Cdisplays.

13.8.—Synchro-driven repeater.
TheSynchrodriuen Repeater.—If the stators and rotors areattached respectively inparallel and the rotors are connected toana-cpower source (Fig.
13.8), the two rotors will tend toalign themselves inthe same direction.
Any departure from this condition will result incir- culating currents inthe stators which will cause amotor action tending toproduce alignment.
Ifone rotor isdriven, the other will follow, with only enough lagtofurnish thenecessary power.
Ifthesecond rotor has little ornomechanical load, this lagwill bevery small atrotational speeds uptoafew revolutions persecond; iftheload isappreciable, thelagmay amount toafew degrees.
Inorder toreduce theeffect oflag, thesystem isoften “geared up.” For example, the transmitter synchro can be attached toashaft rotating 10times asfast asthescanner, and thereceiv- ing synchro can then drive arotating PPI deflection coil through a 10-to-l gear reduction.
Under these conditions, the lag error can be kept toasmall fraction ofadegree.
There is,however, a10-fold uncer- tainty inthe position ofthe deflection coil inour example, since any of 10antenna positions looks the same tothe receiver.

Standard-design low-impedance synchros are used.
Transmitter and repeater areidentical except fortheinclusion ofamechanical damper onthe shaft ofthe repeater.
The maximum speed ofrotation ofthe synchros isabout 400 rpm, restricting a10-speed system to40rpm.
The principal disadvantage ofusing synchros toprovide torque is that power must betransmitted bythe primary s.vnchro.
This limits thenumber ofrepeaters which can beused.

Several types ofnegative-feedback amplifiers are used inindicator circuits.
Cathode Feedback.—A simple variety ofnegative-feedback circuit uses anunbypassed cathode resistor toprovide the feedback voltage (Fig.
13.1la).
The load may beinthe plate, itmay bethecathode resistor, oritmay bedivided between plate and cathode circuits toprovide two output points.
For aplate load, thefeedback voltage isactually proportional tothe current through theload’ rather than tothevoltage across it;this iscalled “current feedback.” Ifthe load current isofinterest (asindriving a deflection coil), this isjust what iswanted.
If,onthe other hand, the uolfuge across the plate load isofinterest, acathode resistor gives the proper type offeedback only ifthe load isalso purely resistive.
If 1Ifapentode orbeam-power tube isused, thescreen current passes through the cathode resistor butnotthrough theload.
Invery exacting cases some account must betaken ofthisfact. 494 THERECEIVING SYSTEM—INDICATORS [SEC.
136 theplate load isreacthe, thecathode impedance should bealso, with the same sort offrequency response.
For pure resistances the feedback ratio isRk/(RL) and GoisRL/(Rk +R~)multiplied bythe gain that would obtain ifboth resistances were intheplate circuit.
Inthe cathode followers ofFig.
13”llb, the cathode circuit serves as the load and the plate isconnected directly toB+, resulting ina nega- tive-feedback amplifier ofgainless than 1,characterized bygreat linear- ity, excellent frequency response, high input impedance, and low output impedance.
Since theentire output voltage appears across thecathode, thefeed- back ratio Pisunity.
Therefore Gisalways less than 1[Eq.
(l)], approaching, forlarge values ofthecathode resistor, thevalue AL/(U +1), where pisthevoltage amplification constant ofthetube.
Since l/GO is nearly always considerably less than O,the amplifier has afaithful response.
The internal impedance ofthe circuit driling the total load isgiven by 1 )where g-isthe mutual conductance and RPthe plate g.+l/Rp resistance ofthetube.
This isalittle less than l/g~, and istherefore in the range from one toafew hundred ohms.
The input impedance ofthe tube itself (assuming nogrid current) results from the sum ofthe capacities between the grid and the fixed elements (plate, screen, etc.), plus the grid-cathode capacity divided by 1–G,where Gisthe gain.
This impedance isinparallel with thegrid resistor and the wiring capacity.
The effective impedance ofthe grid resistor connection can beincreased bythe method shown onthe right inFig.
13”1 lb,since the drop inthegrid resistor isthereby reduced.
Among theapplications ofthecathode follower arethefollowing: 1.As alow-impedance source tosupply the considerable power required todrive such aload asatransformer oradeflection coil.
2.Asalow-impedance source which will provide fairly uniform fre- quency response even when considerable capacity isassociated with theload.
The time constant and therefore thehigh-frequency response will bedetermined bythe capacity inparallel with the internal impedance ofthetube and resistance Rk.
Since thetube impedance issmall, good response can beobtained atfrequencies ofafew megacycles persecond, even with fairly large load capaci- ties.
However, theinternal impedance ofthetube atany instant depends upon the actual tube constants atthat instant.
Asteep negative wavefront may cause thegrid toenter into aregion oflow g~ortocutoff,ifthecurrent flowing istoosmall todischarge the ocmdenser with sufficient rapidity.
The current can beincreased SEC.

Since thefeedback ratio isunity foreach output signal, this “split load” or”phase-splitting” amplifier has many ofthedesirable properties ofthe cathode follower, but thesingle- sided gain isalways less and theinternal impedance isgreater.

Since di/dtisalso aconstant thewaveform con- sists ofastep plus alinear increase.
The sweep isusually produced by anincreasing current since, except inspecial cases, this results inthe minimum average current.
Asaresult, the coil voltage drop during thesweep results inadecrease intheplate potential ofthedriver tube.
The drop across thecoilreaches itsgreatest value attheend ofthefastest sweep, and thepower-supply potential must bedesigned toaccommodate this case.
Such asweep need notdissipate much power since theaverage current islow, but unfortunately thesame power supply isused onhigh– duty–ratio sweeps where the average current ishigh.
The total power dissipation due tothe sweep circuit can beminimized byusing alarge number ofturns onthedeflecting coil and acorrespondingly high supply voltage, since this reduces thelosses inthedriver tube and inthepower supply itself.
Usually, however, other circuits derive their power from thesame supply, and ahigh voltage results inunnecessary dissipation in them.
Inconsequence, thesystem isoften designed insuch away that theplate ofthedriver tube operates onthemargin ofinsufficient voltage onfast sweeps.
Even ifthis were not the case, the amplifier would tend todiscriminate against thehigher frequencies because ofthehigher impedance offered bythecoils tothese frequencies.
Asaresult ofthese factors good range sweeps can beobtained only with the use ofgreater negative feedback than would benecessary merely tocorrect fornonlinearities inthe tube inanormal application. 496 THERECEIVING SYSTEM—INDICA TORS [SEC.

The Generation ofRectangular Waveforms.-A rectangular waveform isone whose outstanding characteristics aresteep, alternately positive and negative wavefronts with aspace between (for example, Fig.
13.12).
The term wilf include waveforms whose “tops” and “bottoms” arenot completely flat.
Insome applications only tbe timing ofone orboth wavefronts matters, the particular shape ofthe whole wave not being ofinterest; (a) Square wave oscillator (no external stimulus) {Trkwf ~ (b)Flip-flop ‘e’p””’’nnn—r I“-V-’Sinusoid (c)3quaring amplifier ‘es””’’J-Ll-L /Trigger#l ~ (d) Flopover Trlsser X2~ [’-n”J—uLr—u (Trigger I I I II (e)Scaleoftwo ~‘es””” _nll——r FIG.13.12.—Response ofvarious waveform generators.
inothers theshape isalso important.
Among thelatter aresuch appli- cations asthe intensifying ofcathode-ray tubes and the operating of various electronic switches.
Rectangular waves can beused fortiming purposes—for example, toinitiate thegeneration ofsharp pulses orother- wise toinitiate some particular event attheinstant ofoccurrence ofone ofthewavefronts.
The circuits that produce such waveforms can bedivided into three categories: 1.Those inwhich the waveform isproduced without external stimulus—that is,free-running oscillators (Fig.
13”13).
2.Those inwhich anexternally induced departure from astable state with production ofawave front islater followed byaspontaneous return which produces the wavefront ofopposite polarity (Fig.
13.14).
Such adevice iscalled a“single stroke” generator or SEC.

3.Those inwhich both wavefronts areexternally induced.
Inthis class arethe “squaring amplifier, ”which produces square waves from sinusoids orother waveforms, and various triggered devices.
The latter can bedivided into two classes: (a)the “flopover” or “lockover, ‘‘inwhich anexternal signal induces achange from one stable state toanother, and areverse signal orone from asecond source reverses theoperation (Fig.
13.15a); and (b)“scale-of-two” circuits, inwhich successive triggers from asingle source induce alternate transitions between two stable stqtes (Fig.
13”15b).
The name “scale-of-two” arises from thefact that ifsharp pulses are derived from those wavefronts ofo~epolarity their number will be half that oftheoriginal trigger pulses.

Electronic Switches.-An electronic switch isa device that can change the parameters ofthe circuit inwhich itoccurs.
The principal functions performed bysuch switches aretocontrol theabsolute potential level ofapoint inthe circuit, andto control thetransmission orgenera- tion ofsignals byswitching them onand offorbychoosing between different signals.
Activation ofthe switch can becontrolled either by thesignals themselves (just asarectifier oranoverload relay iscontrolled) orbyastimulus independent ofthesignals.
Initsaction theswitch can beeither aseries element analogous toavalve that opens and closes to block ortransmit the signals, oraparallel element that, when closed, holds apoint inthecircuit inaquiescent state regardless ofthepresence ofsignals.
Clamps .—The name “clamp” isapplied toawide variety ofelectronic switches which, when closed, hold orclamp two circuit points together more orless rigidly.
They differ from ordinary mechanical switches in that their impedance isoften appreciable and frequently variable, and inthat many clamps conduct current inonly one direction.
Infact, itis often the latter characteristic that enables the device tofunction asa switch.
The simple diode isaclamp that isclosed when the anode attempts tobepositive with respect tothe cathode, but open whn thereverse is true.
The opening and closing may result from the waveform applied toone oftheelectrodes, asinarectifier oradetector, orone oftheelec- trodes may bechanged inpotential from time totime byaseparate impulse.
The useofdiodes forswitching purposes hasbeen rendered more attractive bytheadvent ofthegermanium-crystal type ofrectifier, which admirably replaces the vacuum-tube diode inmany applications, par- ticularly those involving 50volts orless ofback emf.
The D-cRestorer.

Inthe absence ofthe diode, theaverage potential ofpoint Amust beVO,since Rfurnishes the only d-cconnection.
When the diode isplaced inthe circuit, itprevents A from swinging more negative than VO,sothat V,may bethought ofasa base with respect towhich theentire waveform ispositive.

The waveform tobedemodulated isapplied totheinput terminal ofthecir- cuit and the transformer isexcited byanunmodulated wave which is exactly inorexactly out ofphase with the carrier.

The switching signal always “leaks” through theclamp tube tosome extent bycapacity coupling, particularly atthe “off-point .“ For this reason theswitching signal should benosteeper orlarger than necessary.
Because ofthis, pentodes aresometimes used insuch circuits asthose of Fig.

The rising wave ofthesawtooth isan exponential oftime constant RC,asindicated inWaveform 2ofFig.

Ifthesawtooth has anamplitude small compared toE—that is, ifRC>>T—the rise isapproximately linear (Waveform 3).
Such saw- tooth generators are widely used incases where nogreat precision is required.
When various sweep speeds aretobeused, itisnecessary tochange therate ofrise ofthesawtooth.
This can bedone indiscrete fashion by switching the condenser, the resistance, or,within limits, the charging voltage.
Continuous variation ismost satisfactorily accomplished by using arheostat forR(unless the control isremote) orbyvarying E through apotentiometer.

The amplified signal isapplied tothe“bottom” ofthe condenser, sothat thepotential ofXchanges only bythedifference between thecharge across thecondenser and that fedback.
Thus thechange inpotential across Riskept very small and thecharging current isvery constant.
The most commonly used ofsuch methods isthe Miller “run-down” circuit ofFig.

The two circuits shown differ only inthe methods ofswitching.

The entire plate swing isapplied tothe condenser, sothat thefeedback ratio is1.Inthe case of suppressor switching, allofthecurrent goes tothescreen between sweeps.
The control grid isheld against the cathode byvirtue ofitspositive bias.
When thesuppressor isswitched on,most of the current transfers tothe plate, which experiences anegative surge that ispassed ontothecontrol grid.
The sawtooth genera- tion then begins asindicated inthewaveform diagrams.
The step atthebeginning ofthesawtooth isinsome cases detrimental and inothers useful.
INDICES Itisalways desirable and usually mandatory toprovide some form ofquantitative indices ormarkers forthe radar indicator.
These may consist simply ofagridwork oflines or,when high accuracy isrequired, ofone ormore movable indices.
Inaddition, itisoften desirable to superpose some form ofmap orchart onaradar display, inorder topro- vide accurate correlation with fixed echoes fornavigational purposes or toshow ataglance thegeographical position ofaship oraircraft target.
Markers canbeprovided either byplacing asurface containing themarks asnearly aspossible inoptical superposition with the display, orby modulating the electron beam insuch away that the marks appear as part ofthedisplay itself.
Indices orcharts ruled onatransparency over thetube face arethe simplest ofalltoprovide, but their useresults inerrors due todisplay inaccuracies, toparallax, and tofaulty interpolation.
Furthermore, if the origin ofthe display istobemoved, itisnecessary toprovide a corresponding motion ofthereference system, which isusually cumber- some, orifonly afew positions areinvolved, tofurnish multiple sets of marks insuch away that noconfusion results.
The methods ofoptical superposition described inSec.
7.3largely eliminate parallax and are 514 THE RECEIVING ISYST13fi{-I,VDICA l’ORS [SEC.
1311 helpful inthecase ofmultiple indices, but their principal usefulness isin connection with plotting and theuseofcharts.
“Electronic” marks eliminate orreduce many ofthese difficulties.
Parallax errors areentirely eliminated.
Since theindices aregenerated byprecision methods that are independent ofthe formation ofthe display geometry, they automatically fall intheir proper place onthe display regardless ofwhere itmay becentered orhow muchit may be deformed ordistorted.
Ingeneral, electronic methods ofproducing interpolation indices are far less cumbersome than mechanical ones.
However, inthecase ofaslow scan theintermittent nature ofthedisplay makes itdifficult tosetanindex ontheecho, unless rather complicated switching methods areintroduced toprovide theindices atmore frequent intervals.
Electronic indices areinvariably used forrange determinations, since they canbereadily provided with ahigh degree ofprecision and since the radar data areinherently capable ofproviding great accuracy inrange.
Incases where thefundamental data arenotsoprecise, thechoice depends upon circumstances.
Electronic marks are always used ifthe display istobecontinuously movable inposition orinsize, but inmany ofthe cases where only afew discrete changes areinvolved, external markers aresufficiently simpler towarrant their use.
The following two sections will describe methods ofproviding directly viewed electronic indices; auxiliary optical aids have already been described inChap.

13.11.
Angle Indices.—Because oftheir simplicity, fixed angle indices ruled onatransparency arewidely used inspite oftheinaccura- cies described above.
The inherent data are usually farless accurate than those ofrange.
Furthermore, inmany applications, such asthat ofhoming, theangle ofinterest changes slolvly ifatalland there istime forrepeated observations.
Parallax errors aremade assmall aspossible byplacing the scale very close tothe tube face, and inmany cases by ruling onboth sides ofarather thick transparency inorder toprovide a line ofsight.
Movable angle indices ofthesame type arelittle used except inthe important case ofthe centered PPI, where the motion isone ofsimple rotation.
The index or“cursor” may consist ofathin metal strip viewed edgewise orofatransparency with aruled line orathin slit milled through it.
Itissupported byaring bearing larger than thetube face and isusually turned bymeans ofahand crank towhich adata transmitter may beattached ifdesired.
Readings are made from a circular scale attheedge ofthetube.
FixedElectronic AngleIndices.—An electronic angle index can be provided bybrightening thecathode-ray tube forafew sweeps sothat a SEC.1311] ANGLE INDICES 515 bright narrow line isproduced atagiven azimuth.
The electrical impulse necessary todothis can beprovided inany ofseveral ways.
1.The simplest method involves the use ofmechanical contractors onthe scanner oronany mechanical repeater ofthe scanner motion.
The contact isusually made byarnicroswitch operated byacamon arotating shaft.
Since itisimpossible toopen and close theswitchin ashort enough angular interval, unless thescan isvery slow, some device forproducing ashort pulse must be introduced.
This can consist ofaflip-flop triggered bythemicro- switch although, formedium orslow scam, itispossible tomake useofthetransit time, ofamechanical relay.1 Inorder toproduce asetofmarkers, anequal numbeqof cams ona one-speed shaft or Rotatingdisk 6CP+25Gv Light bulb 6,3v * FIG.13.33 .—Photocel1 index circuit.

The latter method ispreferable because ofthecleaner action, 2.Figure 1333 illustrates amethod forgenerating angle marks by using aphotocell mounted behind aslotted rotating disk.

Anoscillation ofthis sort ispreferable toasimple rectangular pulse ifthe signals are tobepassed through mixing orother circuits whose low-frequency response isnot asgood as demanded bythevery long (asmuch as~see) marker pulse.
Movable Electronic AngleIndices.-The methods ofproducing fixed electronic angle indices can beextended toprovide movable ones.
This can most easily bedone, with thesynchro method ofFig.

The two nulls will result intwo signal markers 180° apart.
Ifthis isundesirable one ofthem can beremoved byamethod involving theuse ofamultiphase rotor inthesecond synchro.
Asecond modulation envelope, 90°out of phase with the first, isobtained and used toblank one ofthe markers (see Fig.
4.5, Vol.
22).
The production ofamovable index bythe contactor orphotocell method requires that the differential setting bemade mechanically.
This method isseldom used unless the indicator contains amechanical repetition ofthescanner motion.
Movable electronic indices appear onthe indicator only when the cathode-ray beam isonaparticular part ofthe tube face.
Tosetan index onanecho, itisessential tobeable toobserve theresults ofmoving theindex.

thepreceding paragraph will “flash up” only asthe scanner passes by.
The operator hasnochance tomake acorrection before thenext scan, and even then thecorrection must beaneducated guess.
Itisvery difficult tomake accurate settings within the space ofafew scans, especially if there isrelative motion between radar setand target.
1 Itis,therefore, essential onslow scans tousesome other method.
For alldisplays except rotating-coil PPI’s, the so-called “substitution” method illustrated inFig.
13.35 can beused.
From time totime control ofthedisplay isswitched from theregular angle data transmitter toone that can besetbythe operator.
During these intervals the direction taken bytherange sweep isdetermined bythe setting ofthe “substitu- tion” transmitter and isthus under the control ofthe operator.
The switching may bemade tooccur automatically onacertain fraction ofthe range sweep cycles equally distributed throughout the scan (which requires rapid electronic switching), oritmay occur continuous yover an ITheproblem isgreatly simplified ifaided tracking isused—that is,ifcome am%of computer moves theindex inaccordance with therelative motion, using knowledge acquired bymaking thebest settings possible inthepast. 518 THE RECEIVING SYSTEM—INDICATORS [SEC.

Inthe first case the index appears continuously, and inthe second itappears during anappreciable fraction ofthescan.
Ineither event, theoperator isable tomake this setting while theindex ispresent.
The method isnot applicable toarotating-coil system because ofitsinertia.
Fortunately, however, this type ofdisplay isitself exceedingly accurate inangle, so that themechanical cursor can beused onthecentered PPI display with little error except that due toparallax.

Range and Height Indices; Synchronization.
+ince the providing ofelectronic range indices isfrequently intimately associated with synchronization, these topics can best bediscussed together.
The discussion will besimplified ifmovable indices aredescribed first.
Methods ojObtaining Movable Marlcers.—In general, four methods are used forobtaining acontinuously movable marker.
Inincreasing order ofthe precision that can beobtained they are: (1)the cathode-coupled multivibrator; (2)thephantastron; (3)atiming circuit based onalinear sawtooth; (4)thephase-shifting ofaprecision sinusoid.
The use ofthe multivibrator orthe phantastron fortime-delay pur- poses has been discussed inthesections describing those devices and no further description need begiven.
The useofasawtooth voltage wave fortiming depends upon thefact that thetime taken forsuch awave toreach agiven voltage ispropor- tional tothevoltage chosen.
Figure 1336 illustrates acircuit bymeans ofwhich this principle can bevery precisely applied.
Tubes Vl,Vl,Vs, and Viconstitute aprecision sawtooth generator.
The drop across the condenser Cand the lack ofunity gain inthe cathode follower (Sec.
13.10) are compensated bythe network composed ofCaand Rzwhich integrates thesawtooth appearing onthecathode ofVsand thus provides across C2acorrection proportional toL2.
The sawtooth waveform is applied totheplate ofdiode Vs,whose cathode has apositive bias ofan amount determined bythesetting ofthedelay potentiometer.
Because ofthis bias, nosignal passes through the diode until the sawtooth has reached adefinite amplitude, determined bythe bias value.
When the critical amplitude isreached (attime tlonthewaveform diagram), the remainder ofthe sawtooth appears onthe grid ofVG.
This partial sawtooth isamplified byVc, differentiated inthe plate-loading trans- former, further amplified inVT,and ultimately used totrigger, thesingle- stroke blocking oscillator circuit ofVa,which produces thedelayed pulse.
The slope control determines the range scale and the zero-set resistors balance out the combined effects ofthe starting time ofthe switching square wave, the starting voltage ofthe sawtooth, and the conduction point ofthe diode.

The most accurate timing device atpresent available isaprecision oscillator.
This device can beused for the generation ofamovable marker only bysome method involving acontinuous shifting ofitsphase.
Extremely precise indices can begenerated inthis way, although the error ofmost phase-shifting elements islarge (0.3 per cent).
Space permits nodescription ofthis method but thereader isreferred toChap.

Movable HeightMarker.—The indices used fordetermining height on the RHI orthe type Edisplay are usually engraved mechanical ones.
Often, however, amovable electronic index isprovided.
Neglecting the earth’s curvature, thetime tatwhich anindex ofconstant height hshould appear onanindividual sweep isdefined bytheequation h= Rsin4=~t sin& or2ht=—csin6’ where Risslant range, @iselevation angle, and cthe velocity oflight.
The timing can most easily bedone bymeans ofalinear-sawtooth delay circuit.
Avoltage proportional tosin@isused asthesupply potential forthe sawtooth generator.
Thus, foragiven diode bias, the slope of thesawtooth isproportional tosin@and the time delay isproportional toI/sin O.
The height represented can then belinearly controlled by varying the diode bias.
Ingeneral, the inherent radar data are not accurate enough tojustify circuits asprecise asthat ofFig.
1336.
At large ranges acorrection must bemade fortheearth’s curvature.
This can bedone with sufficient accuracy byadding atzterm tothesawtooth voltage, such aterm being obtainable byintegrating thesawtooth itself asinFig.
13.36.
Discrete Timing Markers.
—Discrete indices areinvariably produced byderiving sharp pulses from asinusoid that isproperly phased with respect tothe modulator pulse.
The exact methods depend upon cir- cumstances and inparticular upon whether ornot the marker circuit provides the synchronization.
Figure 13.37 gives atypical example in which itdoes so;Fig.
13.38, one inwhich itdoes not.
The oscillator ofFig.
13.37 canbeofany type satisf ying theparticular precision requirements.
The original sinusoid isamplified and clipped toproduce asymmetrical square wave ofthe same frequency.
The “negative-going” edge ofthis square wave isthen used totrigger a single-stroke blocking oscillator.
The frequency ofthe sinusoidal oscil- lator, and therefore ofthepulses, ismade equal tothat ofthemost closely SEC.K3.121RANGE ANDHEIGIiT INDICES; SYNCHRONIZATION 521 spaced markers desired.’ Lower-frequency markers are provided by scaling circuits.
Afinal scaling circuit provides pulses ofproper frequency fortriggering themodulator, thesweeps, etc.
Inthefigure itisassumed that the desired frequency values aresuccessively integral multiples of thelowest frequent y.
Ifthis isnotthecase, multiple counting channels arenecessary; forsimplicity anintegral relationship isusually chosen.
When synchronization isexternal, the oscillator must beshock- excited.
Figure 13.38 illustrates anLC-oscillator widely used inmedium- precision applications.
When VIisconducting, the circuit isquiescent and energy isstored intheinductance byvirtue ofthe cathode current.

Inmany cases a simpler pulse generator can beused.
When two ormore marker frequencies areneeded alternatively, the resonant circuit isswitched.
Scaling-down israrely used, since more vacuum tubes would beinvolved and since itwould benecessary to recycle thecounting circuits oneach pulse cycle.
Delayed Sweeps.—Any ofthe timing circuits just discussed can be used toprovide the trigger foradelayed, expanded sweep, and infact thk function canbecombined with that ofaccurate range determination.
The most usual method using continuous delays isillustrated intheblock diagram ofFig.

The Design ofA-scopes.—This section will describe two methods for synthesizing type Adisplays, one ofextreme simplicity intended only fortest and monitoring purposes, and theother ofamore elegant form.
ASimple A-scope.—In Fig.
13.41 simplicity ofdesign hasbeen carried tothe extreme inproducing anindicator intended only fortesting or monitoring applications inwhich brightness and sweep linearity arenot ofgreat importance.

One ofthehorizontal deflecting plates oftheCRT isdriven directly bythis sawtooth; theother, byanegative sawtooth provided bythe inverting amplifier V1~, which isprovided with cathode feedback.
Since arather large sawtooth (=100 volts) isgenerated without exponential correction, the sweep slows down slightly toward theend.
Asisshown, two sweep speeds areprovided, one of300 psec using C, astheintegrating condenser, and asecond ofapproximately 5psec using the stray capacity atpoint 1?.
More values can ofcourse beprovided byadding more switch points and condensers.
Inthe interest ofsim- plicity the flip-flop isnot switched, being left onforthe duration ofthe slower sweep.
When thefaster sweep isused, thebeam isswept entirely offthetube face and remains offuntil termination oftheflip-flop.
The video amplifier illustrated has abandwidth ofabout 1Me/see, the exact value depending upon the stray capacity introduced bythe connecting circuits.

13.42 illus- trates anA-scope having provisions for both delayed and undelayed sweeps, fixed range markers, and aninterpolating range marker.
The cathode-ray tube used isofthepost-deflection-acceleration type using up to4000 volts over-all with reasonable deflection sensitivity (Sec.
13.1).
Aprecision variable delay and afixed delay arecombined tofurnish a delayed trigger and aprecision range marker asdescribed inconnection with Fig.
13.39.
The marker can beused todetermine thedesired delay inadvance bysetting itatthe point ofinterest.
Since the minimum range ofthemarker isincreased bythefixed delay, aswitch (S2) ispro- vided forsubstituting theearlier pulse when anundelayed sweep isbeing used atshort ranges.
The dial calibration must then bechanged accord- ingly, thesimplest method being theuse ofasecond scale.
The sweep circuits, which comprise thetop row oftheblock diagram, areshown schematically below.
Onbeing triggered, the square-wave generator Vzbrightens the cathode-ray tube, switches the sawtooth generator, and, when the sweep isnot delayed, also switches the fixed- marker generator.
The sawtooth generator V,,V,(seeSec.13.10) furnishes avery linear positive sawtooth which isofsufficient amplitude todrive one ofthe horizontal deflecting plates ofthe cathode-ray tube.
The inverting amplifier VS., which drives the opposite CRT plate, is made very linear byplate-to-grid feedback.
The equal condensers inthegrid circuit ensure that thegain from point Btopoint Cisunity, tokeep themean potential ofthe deflecting plates constant (Sec.
131).
The d-crestorers V.hold thesweep origin fixed regardless ofduty ratio.
Two fixed and one variable sweep speeds are shown.
The square- wave generator isautomatically turned offatthe proper time bythe action ofV1.The positive sawtooth isdelivered tothegrid ofV,,which isbiased beyond cutoff bysuch anamount that itstarts toamplify just asthesawtooth reaches the desired peak amplitude.

Either an electrostatic oramagnetic cathode-ray tube can beused, the former being much cheaper but far less satisfactory.
Except for the final amplifiers the circuit requirements inagiven situation are similar, no matter which tube type isused.

Alternatively, apush-pull direct-coupled amplifier isinserted.

Inmany applica- tions, however, more flexibility isdesired, requiring more complicated methods.

This isaccomplished bythe circuit ofVT., v7b, Vs,andl’g.
Bymeans ofaresistance network across two phases ofthe differential synchro avoltagel isobtained which hasamodulation phase 90°removed from that ofthe azimuthal sweep voltage.
After rectification byV,, this signal controls the action ofthe flopover Vs.The latter triggersin opposite directions attwo points which are symmetrical inscan angle with respect tothe center ofthesector displayed.
The angular interval between these points isadjustable bymeans ofthebias applied through the secondary ofthe isolating transformer ahead ofthe rectifier.
The plate ofVS.controls the potential ofthe CRT cathode through d-c restorer V7.and itsparallel resistor insuch away that the cathode-ray tube isturned ononly when Vtiisconducting.
The range sweep and associated delay circuits areshown inthebottom row.
The simple delay multivibrator isnot intended foruse inrange determinations, but can bereplaced bysome such arrangement asthat ofFig.
13.42 ifaccurate range measurements aretobemade.
Since only discrete sweep lengths are involved, the range-sweep flip-flop isswitched along with thesawtooth generator inorder toelimi- nate the vacuum tube otherwise required foranautomatic “turn-off” circuit.
Since the amplitude ofthe sawtooth issmall compared tothe supply voltage, itissufficiently linear without special precautions.
If continuous sweep-length control isdesired, the circuits ofFig.
13.42 should besubstituted, the feedback voltages fortheturn-off circuit and forthesawtooth generator being taken from the cathode ofV15~.
The sawtooth passes through the “phase-splitting” amplifier Vl,b, which provides signals ofboth polarities forthe push-pull sweep ampli- fiers.
The cathode feedback ofthe final arriplifiers issufficient togive reasonably linear current amplification, since thepush-pull action tends tocompensate fortube nonlinearities.
The high-frequency response is notgood enough, however, toprovide alinear displacement atthebegin- ning ofvery fast sweeps.
For this reason a“step” isintroduced atthe beginning ofthe sawtooth byplacing asmall resistor inseries with the charging condenser ofthe sawtooth generator.
The sudden transfer of current from the switching tube Vltitothe condenser circuit results in theabrupt appearance ofavoltage drop across theresistor, thus providing thestep.
The above circuits can beused toproduce a“micro-B” display by theexpedient ofgearing together the sweep-delay and the sector-width controls, and providing the proper normalization.

Plan-position Indicator.-As has been indicated inearlier sections (e.g.,Sec.
12”2), PPI displays can beproduced byany ofseveral methods, which, ingeneral, may beclassified under three principal headings.
1.The rotating-coil method, inwhich the range-sweep current is passed through acoil which isrotated about the tube neck in synchronism with the antenna motion.
If“off-centering” is desired, itisprovided bymeans ofafixed coil outside ofthemoving one.
2.The “resolved time base” method, inwhich asawtooth waveform ispassed through a2-phase resolver, 1practically always asynchro, and the resulting sweep “components” are utilized toenergize orthogonal deflecting coils orplates.
3.The method of“pre-time-base resolution” inwhich slowly varying sine and cosine voltages obtained from ad-cexcited sinusoidal potentiometer orbyrectification ofsignals from ana-cresolver are used togenerate the necessary sawtooth.
This method isused principally incases where thescan istoorapid fortherotating-coil method and theantenna issofaraway that thetransmission ofthe 1Insome cases a3-phase synchro isused, andtheresulting signals arepassed through aresistor network which reduces thethree phases totwo. .-—Groundf —..J’l_f=l_lTrigger I I I(CT)Sawtooth~1r- (A)CRTswitching signal,~ ~ ,D),ridO,~’”&! switching%,,, JllTJ ‘“’’a’”””’”’ ‘!/U I_(B)Sawtooth generator ~ Trl~er I F==lI=kI offl-dwave,,.......,,..AA +-lIron.cored off.centermg co Sweepcoil <Scanner 1r Synchro ~ Iamp.VIII-l“w,l=.

13.16 slowly varying voltages isappreciably easier than would bethe case with the sawtooth waveforms involved inthe resolved-time- base method.
Methods 2and3 can reapplied either tomagnetic ortoelectrostatic cathode-ray tubes, but, because oftheir inferiority forintensity -modu- lated displays, thelatter tubes areseldom used.
TheRotating<oil Method.
—Figure 13.44 illustrates the circuits used toproduce the sweeps ofarotating-coil PPI, omitting such accessory parts asrange-marker circuits, etc.
The tubes Vl,V*, Vu,and V4con- stitute asquare-wave and asawtooth generator similar tothose ofFig.
13.42 except that adiode clamp (Vu) isillustrated forvariety inFig.
13.44.
Tubes Vsa,VSb,and VCconstitute afeedback amplifier whose linear output current drives the deflection coil.
The drop across the cathode resistor ofVe,which isdue almost entirely tothe deflecting current, isfedback tothe cathode ofVsa.
Because ofthe high gain in the feedback 106P, this voltage faithfully reproduces the form ofthe original sawtooth, thus assuring thedesired linear increase inthecurrent.
Since any current through VCbetween sweeps would result inacircular rather than apoint origin forthesweep, this tube isbiased beyond cutoff.
Since there isnofeedback solong asV6 isbeyond cutoff, itsgrid isele- vated very rapidly atthebeginning ofthesawtooth and there isthus no appreciable delay before thecurrent starts.
The deflecting coil isrotated byamechanical repeater such asthose described inSec.
13“5.
The diagram atthe upper right illustrates one method ofconnection foran‘‘off-centering” coil.
Thk type ofPPI can bemade tohave thegreatest dependable accu- racy attainable with any type ofintensity-modulated display.
Mechani- calrepeater systems can, within certain limits ofrotational speed, be made tohave accuracies ofasinall fraction ofadegree, 0.10 being a common error limit.
Since the range-sweep feedback amplifier is extremely faithful atlittle cost, the burden ofaccuracy inrange falls on the sawtooth generator, forwhich precision parts ofhigh constancy can easily beused.
The prir+ipal disadvantages oftherotating-coil method are: (1)itislimited tocontinuous scanning rates of30to60rpm and to sector scanning ofcomparable angular velocity; (2) off-centering is extremely expensive inpower, and cannot beused fordisplacements of more than two orthree tube radii because ofexcessive distortion and defocusing; (3)forcases demanding minimum weight, even attheexpense ofaccuracy, therotating-coil PPI isless suitable than some other types.

13.45).
When amplifiers are used, orifanelectrostatic tube without amplifiers isinvolved, theresolver must deliver sawtooth voltages into a high-impedance load; when amagnetic tube isused without amplifiers, sawtooth currents must bedelivered toaninductive load.
Inprinciple the resolver may beasynchro, apotentiometer, ora condenser; asynchro isfarthemost satisfactory and, inspite ofcertain shortcomings, itisuniversally used.
Asinallcases oftransmission ofanonsymmetncal signal through an a-ccoupling, the d-ccomponent ofthesignal islost.

ofthemost serious difficulties involved inthis technique.
With apassive and linear load, the long-time average ofboth the current through the secondary ofthesynchro and thevoltage across itmust bezero (Wave- form 1?,Fig.
13.45).
Thus theabsolute current orvoltage atthebegin- ning ofthe modulated sawtooth will not beconstant, but will change with the modulation amplitude and will reverse sign when the sawtooth does.
Asaresult, ifnocorrective measures were taken, each individual sweep onthe display tube would bedisplaced inthe negative direction byafixed amount and the10CUS ofthesweep origins would bea“nega- tive” circle.
This difficult yhasbeen overcome bytwo general methods, each ofwhich has variations most suitable toparticular circumstances. 536 THE RECEIVING SYSTEM—INDICATORS [SEC.
13.16 The first method involves theuseofclamps mswitches inthesecond- ary circuit toforce the potential orthe current tozero inthe interval between sweeps.
Solong asthe sweep component has agiven polarity, this can bevery simply accomplished inthe potential case byad-c restorer (See.
13“9),and inthecurrent case byaselenium rectifier inseries with the secondary circuit.
Incases where the scanning isconfined to 90°orless, these variations ofthefirst method arethemost satisfactory ofall.
Ifthe scan covers more than 90°, one ofthe diodes must be switched inpolarity from time totimefor example, byacam arrange- ment onthe scanner.
Ifthe scan covers more than 180° both ofthem must besoswitched.
Although itisdifficult toswitch quickly and smoothly enough toavoid aestheticallydispleasing display irregularities, this method isquite satisfactory and isprobably thesimplest forthecase ofresolved currents, providing the scanning rate isnot too high.
A better and only slightly more expensive method ofvoltage restoration involves the use ofadouble clamp (Fig.
13.25) which connects the secondary toapoint ofproper potential between sweeps but releases it when the sweep begins.
This isthe most widely used method inthe voltage case when polarity reversal isinvolved.
Nosatisfactory series switches exist foranalogous usewith resolved currents.
Inthe second method ofcorrecting the sweep-origin difficulty, the positive and negative waveforms are“balanced” about thesweep origin either byintroducing aprecisely controlled negative waveform inthe primary circuit between sweeps, orbyarranging totrigger the trans- mitter automatically atthe precise time when the secondary current or voltage passes through zero.
Both variations involve agood deal of precision and aremore costly than theswitched clamps mentioned inthe last paragraph asusable when voltage isinvolved.
However, the present methods have been widely used inconnection with resolved currents, since they require noswitching elements inthelow-impedance secondary circuit.
Applications ofthese various methods will bedescribed inconnection with thefollowing specific examples.
Magnetic PPIUsingAmplijiers.-Figure 13.46 shows the secondary circuit ofamagnetic PPI ofthe resolved–time-base type using the method ofclamping between sweeps.

The switched clamps shown can bereplaced bysimple d-c restorers ifthescan covers less than 90°.
The final sweep amplifiers are ofthecathode-feedback type usedin theB-scope ofFig.
13.43.
The centering ofthePPI can beadjusted bysetting the potentiom- eters controlling the clamping points.
Ifextreme off-centering moves theamplifier grids out oftheir normal operating range, adelay occursat thebeginning ofthesweep which gives theeffect ofavirtual center atthe desired point.
Byusing anextrernel yhigh-voltag esawtooth, off-center- ing ofasmuch assixtoeight tube radii has been provided.
For such extreme amounts ofoff-centering, itisbest toinsert cathode followers between thepotentiometers and theclamps.
The dependable accuracy obtainable with the resolved–time-base method isnot sogreat ascan beobtained with arotating-coil PPI, although with care itcan bemade nearly asgood except onvery fast sweeps.
However, the present method has much less severe limitations with respect toscanning speed, and provides amuch greater degree of usable off-cent ering than does therotating-coil scheme.
Itsw-eight issomewhat less and itspower requirements somewhat greater than those typical ofthe rotating-coil variety without off- centering.
When off-centering must beprovided, thepresent method is farlighter and less costly inpower.
The technique just described can beapplied toelectrostatic tubes bysubstituting voltage amplifiers inthe final driving stages, orinsome cases byeliminating amplifiers entirely and connecting the clamped points directly toone member ofeach pair ofdeflecting plates.
Unless weight and power consumption areextremely critical, thesaving effected does notjustify thesacrifice inquality entailed.

Resolved-current PPI.—When thedeflection coils aredriven directly bythe synchro, theamplifiers ofFig.
13.46 areeliminated, with the result that theindicator isconsiderably simplified and errors due to imperfections inthe amplifier response areavoided.
These advantages areaccompanied bycertain restrictions which, will appear below.
Inorder toreduce the effects ofdistributed capacity inthe synchro and the deflecting coils, and ofthe shunt capacity ofthe cables, low- inductance windings offew turns are used throughout.
The synchro rotor ismatched tothedriving tube byastepdown transformer.
Since the secondary circuit isalmost purely inductive (ideally itwould be precisely so), itscurrent waveform will resemble that inthe primary of thetransformer, and acurrent amplifier similar tothat driving thedeflec- tion coil ofFig.

Inmany cases imperfections inthe transformer are overcome bytaking the feedback from itssecondary circuit.
The low deflection sensitivity ofthesweep coils renders itimpractical SEC.

Since they areinductively coupled tothesweep coils, thenumber ofturns intheoff-centering coils must also belimited.
Off-centering istherefore expensive incurrent, and its extreme amount isusually limited tonot more than two tube-radii.
Since vacuum tubes are not appropriate asswitches insuch low- impedance circuits, itisnot possible tofixthe sweep origin bymethods analogous tothat ofFig.

Applications of these methods appear inthefollowing descriptions.

Optimum smoothness atthe instant ofswitching isaccom- plished ifcontact ismade through the second rectifier before the first one isopened, sothat the circuit isnever broken.
This method has the virtue ofextreme simplicity and inmany cir- cumstances itgives excellent performance.
However, ithastwo princi- pallimitations inaddition tothe restriction onoff-centering mentioned above: themechanical switching limits the scanning rates atwhich itcan beused, and some distortion isintroduced on“long” sweeps (more than 50miles) bythelow but appreciable resistance oftherectifiers.
Ifthis resistance were constant, the only effect would beadroop caused by inadequate low-frequency response.
This droop could easily beover- come byshaping the primary waveform, but unfortunately the rectifier resistance isnonlinear, being much larger atvery lowthan atintermediate orhigh currents.
Asaresult, theeffect oftherectifier resistance changes with scan angle.
“Circles” ofequal range areslightly “squared, ”the “corners” coming atthe 90°positions.

Thus when asweep isbeing applied this grid will pass upward through itscutoff ppint atexactly the same time that the deflecting current ispassing through zero.
The remainder ofthe saw- tooth istherefore amplified and, bysuitable overdriving and clipping, can beturned into arectangular wave.
The transmitter trigger isthen derived from thefront edge ofthis rectangular wave, and thewave itself serves tointensify the cathode-ray tube.
Ifasimple sawtooth isused, themaximum useful sweep duration has anupper limit ofhalf the pulse period; somewhat less can berealized in inadequate high-frequency response inthesynchro and amplifiers, andfrom crosa- coupling intheformer, were troublesome only onfast sweeps.

Thk form ofresolved-current PPI has been successfully used inthe lightweight airborne equipment (AN/APS-10) described inSees.

Asisshown inFig.
13.48, thesynchro isdriven directly bythe amplifier without atransformer.
The synchro secondary and thedeflec- tion coil (which iswound inastandard synchro stator form) have 3-phase rather than 2-phase windings.
The equipment islight inweight, com- paratively simple and economical.
Its principal drawbacks are the limited duty ratio, the precision required inthe triggering circuit, and the limited off-centering attainable.
Nooff-centering isused with the 3-phase system ofFig.

Both sinusoidal and rectangular waves have been used, but only theformer will bediscussed here.
Awaveform oftheproper type can begenerated bythe Miller-type circuit (Sec.
13.10)shown inFig.
13.49.
When thegrid ofVIisreleased byopening the switch, itquickly rises tocutoff and anegative sawtooth begins ontheplate.
The form ofthis wave ispractically independent of theload impedance, which isinthis case made upoftheinductance L,V2, and R2inseries, and thevarious capacities.
The a-ccomponent ofcur- rent inthe coil isatany instant given by 542 THE REG’EI VI.VG SYSTE,JI—I.VDICA TORS [SEC.
13.17 and istherefore proportional tothetime integral ofE.When Ereaches the desired maximum value, theswitch isclosed and V1isdisconnected.
The sudden termination ofitscurrent results inanoscillation ofLand its associated capacity.
The plate end ofthe inductance swings positive, disconnecting V,asthe potential rises past the 200-volt level.
Onthe down-swing, V2becomes conducting again and clamps theinductance to the 200-volt point, resulting inthewaveform shown.
The amplitude of the oscillation isdependent upon theenergy stored intheinductance at theend ofthesawtooth, which inturn isdetermined bythecurrent and hence bythe “area” under the sawtooth.
Itcan berigorously proved byanalysis that this amplitude must besuch that the average voltage across theinductance (neglecting itsresistance) iszero during thewave- form.
We shall becontent with the general statement that this must besosince, inthe absence ofresistance, the average potential across aninductance during acompletely closed cycle must bezero regardless of waveform.
Therefore inthis case the initial, the average, and the final values ofthe waveform areidentical and itis“balanced” asdesired.
Acomplete circuit using this method isillustrated inFig.
13.50.
The Miller circuit isswitched bythedouble-diode clamp Vs,Vi,which inturn iscontrolled bythe cathode-coupled flopover VI, Vj.
The latter is automatically terminated atafixed sawtooth amplitude bythe signal passed through the biased diode Vs.
The Miller circuit islike that described inconnection with Fig.
1349, except that V,(V,ofFig.
13-49) isbiased somewhat below 200 volts, thereby introducing asmall correc- tion totake care ofinadequacies intheresponse ofthedeflection system.
The potentiometer P1allows awide variation inthe sweep speed used, and Psadjusts thepattern toproper size.
The amplifier uses negative feedback ofasignal taken across aresistor inthetransformer secondary, thereby correcting fordeficiencies intrans- former response.
Incontrast toprevious cases, the final stage ofthe amplifier isdriven negative during the actual sweep; thus the induced voltage ontheplate ispositive and thetube does not “bog down.
”The high potential needed forquick recovery ~vhen thecurrent isrising again isprovided bythejoint action ofL1and Cl.
During thesaw-tooth alarge positive voltage isinduced inL1,and Clischarged accordingly.
When the current derivative reverses attheend ofthesawtooth, thevoltage is temporarily maintained atahigh level byC,,and, inspite oftheinduced voltage across thetransformer, the plate ofthetube remains atawork- able voltage level during therapid back-swing.

Technically, it involves fewer parts, itsmethod ofarea balancing has somewhat greater reliability, and ithas the advantage ofbeing usable with self-synchro- nous modulators.
Incommon with allbalanced-waveform methods, its duty ratio islimited tosome 50to60per cent unless excessively large peak currents areused inthebalancing waveforms.

The Method ofPre-time-base Resolution.—In certain cases itisdesirable totransmit the scanner data interms ofslowly varying sine and cosine voltages derived from asine-cosine potentiometer, orby themodulated-carrier technique used intheB-scope ofSec.

Thus thesignals attheinput tothe amplifiers aresine-and-cosine-modulated sawteeth ofprecisely thesame nature asthose obtained bypassing asawtooth through asynchro.
The amplifiers can, therefore, beidentical with those ofFig.

Ifitis too inconvenient toprovide both polarities, one can beomitted ineach circuit and aphase-inverting amplifier inserted between the sawtooth generator and thefinal amplifiers.
Inthis case, however, itwill beneces- sary either toused-ccoupling (which isdifficult) ortoprovide clamps on the grids ofthefinal amplifiers.
This method can beused atvery high scanning speeds, since itis possible touse avariable condenser for carrier modulation.
Ithas advantages over the resolved–time-base methods when very fast sweeps areused, since there isnostarting delay such asthat introduced inpassing sweeps through asynchro.

Aaextreme case isthat ofradar relay (see Chap.

Many ofthese advantages make the technique par- titularly appropriate foruse onrange-height indicators.
Ontheother hand, under average conditions, pre-time-base resolution isconsiderably less satisfactory than the methods previously described.
The sine potentiometer, though simple, isprone totroublesome irregu- larities which cannot becompletely filtered, except onextremely slow scans, without causing phase lags inthebasic scanner data.
The useof acarrier and ofdemodulators introduces considerable complexity com- pared with methods described earlier.
The necessity ofmaintaining the sawtooth generators inproper normalization inorder toavoid distortion issomewhat ofaburden compared toother cases where only one such generator isinvolved and where, furthermore, any lack ofconstancy affects only the size and not thefidelity ofthe display.
13.19.
The Range-height Indicator.—Any off-centered PPI can be used asarange-height indicator bysubstituting elevation angle for azimuth, providing the indicator can follow the scanner involved.
In most cases, itisdesirable topresent height onascale that isconsiderably expanded incomparison tothat used forthe display ofground range.
Inconsequence the most adaptable PPI techniques arethose inwhich each cartesian coordinate ha?itsown amplifier which permits thedesired height expansion tobeprovided simply byincreasing the gain ofthe proper channel.
Themethods ofFigs.
13.46 and 13.51 can both beused inthis way.
Simplification canusually beeffected.
Thehorizontal sweep always occurs onthetube face inone direction from theorigin.
Inmany cases, this isalsotrue ofthevertical component.
(Sometimes negative heights areinvolved when the radar isonanelevated site.

13.51 can become single-sided, though still being switched.
The approximation cos 0=1allows the use ofunmodulated sweeps in the horizontal direction; this isofnoparticular virtue ifthe resolved- sweep technique isused, but provides aconsiderable saving inconnection with theuseofamodulated carrier.
The approximation sino=oallows the use oflinear data transmitters, such aslinear potentiometers and condensers.

SIGNAL DISCRIMINATION, RESOLUTION AND CONTRAST The factors that influence the dkcernibility ofasimple radar echo signal against thermal noise have been discussed inChap.
2and inthe early sections ofChap.
12.
We have seen that the characteristics of the receiving equipment which influence this matter most profoundly are the noise figure and bandwidth ofthe receiver, the integrating properties ofthecathode-ray tube screen, and thetype ofdisplay.
Toa lesser extent the cathode-ray-tube spot size and the scale-factor ofthe display also play arole.
Section 12.8 points out methods ofincreasing the signal discernibility inthe presence ofvarious forms ofradiant interference bytaking advantage ofdifferences between the desired and the undesired signals, and shows that tosome extent these same techniques aid indistinguishing apoint target from more diffuse ones.
Chapter 16describes anextremely elegant method bymeans ofwhich agiven target can bereadily distinguished from itssurroundings, pro- viding itisinmotion with respect tothose surroundings and that they areatrest orhave auniform mass motion.
The following paragraphs will dk.cuss another aspect ofthe discrim- ination problem—that ofthe presentation ofamultiple orcomplex picture when itisnot desired tosuppress any ofthe information but rather topresent itinmdetailed amanner aspossible.
13.20.
Resolution and Contrast.—In order todistinguish between objects oramong different parts ofthe same object itisnecessary that they beresolved.
The characteristics ofthe receiving equipment which influence resolution are the bandwidth ofthe signal channel, which affects range resolution, and thespot size and scale factor ofthedisplay, which also affect range resolution and toalesser extent angular resolution aswell.
Since factors concerned with thedisplay areleast under control, and since their limitations often fixthe limit ofusefulbandwidth, they will bediscussed first.
The spot size ofacathode-ray tube depends upon the tube type, the performance ofthe individual tube, the voltage employed, the design offocus and deflecting coils, and the intensity level atwhich the tube isoperated.
Inthe series ofmagnetic tubes used forradar, spot size isroughly proportional tothe tube radius and isusually such that between 150and 200 spots can beresolved along thedisplay radius.
Inthis discussion, the number ofresolvable spots inaradius will SEC.
13.20] RESOLUTION ANDCONTRAST 549 betaken as180.
On arange sweep oflength Rnautical miles, the number ofradar pulse lengths resolvable inprinciple is12.2R/T, where 7 isthe pulse length inmicroseconds.
Thus, onacentered PPI, the fundamental pulse-length resolution and the spot-size resolution are equal when 12.2R/T =180, orR=15when r=1.Accordingly, on asetwith al-psec pulse, a15-mile centered PPI will have thefullinherent range resolution; a100-mile PPI will reduce itapproximately sevenfold, and soon.
This reduction inresolution can beovercome bythe use of expanded displays, but often this measure restricts the field ofview.
Fortunately for the indicator designer, however, this isnot the entire story.
For one thing the operator cannot, except onthe fastest sweeps, realize the fundamental range resolution without optical aids even ifthe display were tomake itavailable; indeed, ona5-in.
tube the spot-size resolution fora100-mile sweep isnearly asgood ascan be comfortable yused, altbough ona12-in.
tube itisthree orfour times worse.
Second, range resolution alone isoflimited usefulness ifitis accompanied bypoor angular resolution; here thefundamental limitation isusually not theindicator but theazimuthal beamwidth.
The angular width oftheCRT spot onany PPI isgiven inradians byR/180r, where R isthe radius ofthe tube and risthe distance from the range origin to the spot inquestion.
This width will beequal tothe beamwidth e, measured indegrees, when 57R/180r =eorR/r=30.
Thus, even fora1°beam, thedisplay resolution exceeds thefundamental resolution forallpoints farther from the origin than one-third ofatube radius.
The cathode-ray tube isusually notthelimiting factor inover-all angukzr resolution, although incertain cases ofaccurate range measurements or ofobservations ongroups ofaircraft orships atlong range, better range resolution onlong-range displays would beuseful.
Frequently, however, theneed forhigh disperm”on requires expanded displays quite apart from question ofresolution.
The above discussion shows that ingeneral the cathode-ray tube imposes asevere restriction inrange resolution onany but the fastest sweeps.
Itistherefore apparent that unless fast sweeps aretobeused there isnopoint ingoing toextreme bandwidths inthe receiver.
In most cases the receiver bandwidth need not besogreat astoimpair seriously the signal-to-noise discrimination.
Itshould beborne in mind, however, that with toosmall abandwidth, asignal farinexcess of the limit level has amuch greater duration after limiting than has a weak signal.
Contrast.—The contrast ofthe display depends upon the character- istics ofthe screen and upon the way inwhich itisexcited.
Unfortu- nate ypresent tubes ofthe persistent type have serious shortcomings in contrast.
The screen material has anatural color much like that ofthe 550 THE RECEIVING SYSTEM-INDICATORS [SEC.
1321 phosphorescent light, sothatcontrast isreduced byreflectedhght.
The necessary thickness ofthe screen tends toblur the edges ofthe signals and thus reduce contrast gradient, asdoalso limitations inthesharpness offocus oftheelectron beam.
Many screens also have acertain amount ofgraininess which contributes tothe reduction ofcontrast gradient.
Contrast between signals ofdifferent intensities isespecially impor- tant inoverland flying, where itisessential tobeable todistinguish land from water and atthe same time tohave good contrast between weak echoes from ordinary terrain and the much stronger ones from built-up areas.
Unfortunately the range ofecho intensities involved issogreat that, ifthe receiver has gain high enough torender the terrain visible, the signals from built-up areas must bedrastically limited toavoid “blooming” ofthe cathode-ray tube, and detail isdestroyed.
Ifthe gain islow enough topreserve detail, theland background isnot visible.
This difficulty ismade worse bythenonlinear response ofthecathode- raytube.
Aswas previously mentioned, thebeam current inamagnetic tube isproportional tothecube ofthegrid-voltage swing measured from cutoff, which isthe operating point inthe absence ofsignal.
This means that asignal of,forexample, half the voltage ofalimited signal will, inprinciple, give only one-eighth asmuch light intensity.
Inactual fact the difference isnot sogreat asthis, because ofthetendency ofthe screen tosaturate onstrong signals.
This nonlinearity reduces con- siderably the difference involtage between those signals that are just strong enough toproduce avisible result and the level at,which strong signals must belimited.
Itispossible tointroduce anonlinear element inthevideo amplifier tocompensate forthetube characteristic, and this has been done with some success.
Noreally satisfactory circuit ofthis sort has been devised, nodoubt because theneed foritwas fully appre- ciated only recently.
Even with alinear CRT grid characteristic, the problem ofnarrow dynamic range would beaserious one.
General methods ofattacking itwill now bedescribed.

Special Receiving Techniques forAir-to-land Observation.— Some improvement inthe ability todistinguish land from water and atthesame time toseedetail inbuilt-up areas can beeffected byusing the anticlutter techniques described inSec.
12.8.
Fast time constants, instantaneous automatic gain control, and other such circuits tend to suppress saturation onlong blocks ofsignals and tomake full use of changes inthesignal intensity.
Unfortunately theuseofsuch measures results inanunnatural appearance ofthe display which makes inter- pretation exceedingly difficult.
Shorelines, for example, stand out very strongly, asdochanges intheterrain.
Similarly asolidly built-up area appears chiefly inoutline, with other strong signals atpoints of changing signal intensity.
Consequently, although they are extremely SEC.

Atsome point inthereceiver, ahead ofanysaturation orlimiting, thesignals aresplit into two channels, inone ofwhich they areamplified much more than intheother.
Ifthe signals arenot already invideo form, each channel includes adetector.
Inany case, each contains alimiter, the one inthe low-gain channel being setatapproximately twice thelevel oftheother.
Thetwo sets of signals aremixed beyond thelimiters and then passed through astandard video amplifier.

inthose from thebuilt-up areas.
A“beforeandafter” picture isshown inFigure 13.55.
Many variations ofthis technique are possible.
One, \vhich has been applied toexisting sets inwhich anadditional channel isdifficult toinstall, consists ofswitching the gain upand the limit level down on alternate pulse cycles bymeans ofascale-of-two multivibrator, the results being added onthe cathode-ray-tube screen.
The results are almost indistinguishable from those obtained bytheuseoftwo channels.
TheLogarithmic Receiver.—A more involved method ofincreasing thedynamic range ofthesystem isbyuseoftheso-called “logarithmic” receiver, whose gain characteristics are such that the response varies approximately asthe logarithm ofthe input signal.
One method of attaining such aresponse, which isactually anextension ofthethree-tone method, isillustrated inFig.
13.56.
Atlow signal levels the principal contribution isfrom the last stage, where the over-all gain ishighest. 554 THERECEIVING SYSTEM-INDICATORS [SEC.
13.21 Asthesignal level increases, thelast stage saturate sandcancontribute nomore.
Bythis time, however, the contribution from the preceaing stage has become appreciable and the output continues toincrease, but atalower rate than that occurring when the gain ofthe last stage was included.
Eventually the second stage saturates, and the gain drops tothat from thenext preceding stage, and soon.
Thus thetotal signal range iscompressed, but there isnocomplete saturation even on very strong signals.
Such receivers have not had very extensive tests with conventional airborne radar, but the rather meager results have shown promise.
One variant that has not been tried, tothe author’s knowledge, istouse different saturation (orlimit) levels inthe various channels, asinthe three-tone method, making this a“multi-tone” device. CHAPTER 14 PRIME POWER SUPPLIES FOR RADAR BY M.
M.
HUBBARD AND P.C.JACOBS Radar equipment requires foritsoperation high-voltage (1000- to 10,000-volt) direct current, medium voltage (~00- to600-volt) direct current, and power forvacuum-tube heaters which usually can beeither alternating ordirect current.
S-ormally, the desired d-c voltages are obtained from ana-csupply bythe use oftransformers and rectifiers, either ofthe thermionic orofthe dry-disk type.
Power supply design varies with the application, and differs foraircraft installations, ground system installations, and ship installations.
AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS Radar power inaircraft should, ifpossible, beobtained from directly- generated alternating current., Where this isnotpracticable, means exist toconvert low-voltage direct current from the aircraft electrical system tothedesired type ofsupply voltage.

14.1.
Choice ofFrequency .—One ofthemost controversial points in early radar development was the selection ofthe a-c frequency tobe used asprimary radar power, Atransformer correctly designed forthe frequency fwill behave tolerably atfrequencies upto3f,but will burn 555 556 PRIME POWER SUPPLIES FOR RADAR [SEC.

For sinusoidal voltages offrequency j, E~==k.n.j.A.B_.
(3)~ Thus ifjishalved, B=must double forafixed input voltage, all other terms being constant inany given case.
Since losses intheiron are afunction ofB-,doubling B~..
produces animmense increase in magnetizing current and incore loss.
The core area and thus theweight ofthetransformer asawhole can bedecreased asfincreases because of the corresponding reduction inB~,,.Bygoing from 60cpsto400 cps, savings intransformer weight of50per cent areattainable.
Core area cannot bemuch further reduced byincreasing jfrom 400 cpsto800cps, asiron losses perpound forconstant B-,increase more than linearly with frequency.
Weight savings of10per cent atmost are obtainable by this change infrequency.
Performance ofrotating equipment must beconsidered, aswell as that oftransformers.
For stable performance and minimum weight ofalternators and a-cmotors, 400 cps ispreferable to800 cps.
(See Sec.
14.2 onwave shape.
)The majority ofexisting airborne radar sets aredesigned for400-cps minimum supply frequency, and itappears that this will continue tobethe nominal standard.
Variable-frequency alternators are also used; they commonly give a2to1ratio between minimum and maximum frequencies, depending onthe speed ofthe aircraft engine.
Ranges often encountered are 400 cps to800 cps, 800 cps to1600 cps, and 1200 cps to2400 cps.

Wave Shape.-4ince allelectric power used forradar iscon- verted todirect current orisused forheating, there isnoinherent require- ment for sinusoidal wave shape.
1However, analternator furnishing voltage ofpoor waveform may show very marked changes inwaveform when itsload ischanged.
Since astable d-cvoltage isthefinal require- ment inmost radar power supplies, itisnecessary tomaintain afixed relationship between the maximum voltage and the rms voltage, whose ratio iscalled the “crest” or*‘amplitude factor.
”The output d-c voltage forrectifier circuits employing condenser input will beafunction ofthe crest voltage.
For rectifiers employing choke input, the ratio ofrms voltage toaverage voltage isimportant; this ratio iscalled the “form factor.
”These two ratios should beasconstant aspossible under allload conditions.
This condition ismore easily met bythe use of alternators with low subtransient reactance.
Prac~ically, it-is preferable toemploy conventional salient-pole rotating-field synchronous alter- nators designed for400 cps, rather than high-impedance inductor alter- nators operating athigher frequencies.
Although the reactance ofan inductor alternator canbeneutralized byaseries capacitance (asisdone in theModel 800-1-C Bendix 800-cps motor-alternator) such balance iscom- pletely effective only atone value ofaload exhibiting fixed power factor.
Changes inload cause changes inwave shape.
Thus, even ifthevoltage regulator (Sec.
14.5)behaves perfect 1yand maintains constant E..or E,~,the output d-cvoltage applied tothe radar may vary excessively.
(See Fig.
14.1.) Furthermore, individual machines ofthe inductor-alternator type show wide variation incharacteristics.
Crest factors measured for different machines ofagiven type have shown variations intherange from 1.15 to1.75.
When power istobederived from analternator ofthis type, transformers forradar rectifiers should beprovided with primary taps, and filament supplies should beobtained from separate transformers.
14.3.
Direct-driven Alternators.-Since all power isultimately derived from the rotation ofthe aircraft engine, fewer devices that can cause trouble are required ifmechanical rotation isused directly to drive analternator.
Adirect-driven alternator will normally furnish alternating current whose frequency varies with engine speed.
This is usually satisfactory forradar operation.
Insome complex components, such asequation-solving circuits, and for synchro applications, fixed frequency isnecessary.
Inthese cases itisoften desirable, particularly where thea-cloads areheavy, toobtain that part oftheload which can beallowed tovary infrequency from anengin~ alternator, using asmall inverter settoobtain thefixed-frequent ypower needed.

This photograph shows theinstallation asdesigned foruseinTBM-3 aircraft, using anauxiliary gear box toobtain dual output from the TBM-3’s single engine pad.
This expedient isusually much more successful than attempting toconvert (with low efficiency) direct current tolarge “bites” ofalternating current.
When pressed foroutput mounting-pad space itiswell toconsider such “dual outlet” gear boxes.
Often such abox can beemployed with older engines (2000- to4000-rpm jack-shaft speed) toutilize high-output 4000- to8000-rpm alternators byincorpo- rating astep-up ratio inthe box.
Such agear box was designed to permit use ofthe same General Electric Company generator with the low-speed jack shafts ofthe B-17-G aircraft engines.
Large aircraft ofthe future will probably have electrical systems furnishing 3-phase 400-cPs fixed-frequency power at208/120 volts (120-volt phase toneutral, 208-volt phase tophase).
This will give 200/1 15bus voltages.
Preliminary tests indicate that such systems, especially those having several large generators inparallel, will bestable, reliable, and directly usable forradar.

The options (2)and (5)can bediscarded atonce.
Electronic invert- ers, although theoretically the most desirable, are practical only for power levels ofafew watts because oflow efficiency arising from tube plate-drop.
Inverters are usually undesirable because they cannot be regulated.
This leaves motor-alternators, dyrmmotors, and vibrators.
Practical limitations oncommutator diameter, voltage per bar, and operation ataltitude restrict the use ofdynamotors.
For example, itisnever wise toattempt touse dynamotors with outputs above 1200 volts.

Voltage Regulators.—Since constant output voltage must be maintained despite changes inload, shaft speed, and d-cinput voltage, some form ofvoltage-regulating device isused with analternator.
For radar applications, anelectronic voltage regulator isthemost satisfactory type.
Although itweighs more than asimple mechanical regulator, an electronic regulator should beemployed onsystems delivering 75o va ormore.
Electronic Voltage Regulators.—An electronic voltage regulator consists ofavoltage-sensitive element, anamplifier, and anoutput stage that supplies d-cexcitation forthe generator oralternator field.
Three types ofvoltage-sensitive elements have been used inexperi- mental regulators.
One consisted ofaVR-tube bridge excited from a transformer and rectifier connected tothe output ofthealternator tobe controlled.
Asuitable filter could beadded tothe rectifier sothat regulation was performed with respect tothe peak value ofthe output waveform.
Similarly, other types offilters could beused toregulate with respect tothe average value ofoutput voltage, ortosome chosen value between peak and average.
The filter introduces atime constant that, insome cases, istoo long toachieve the desired rate ofresponse.
The second voltage-sensitive element, developed byBell Telephone Laboratories, was abridge network made ofthermistors and excited from alternating current.
This gives ana-coutput error voltage that can bereadily amplified, but has the disadvantage ofarelatively long time constant.
The thermistor bridge, though rather difficult tocom- pensate forwide variations intemperature, regulates totherms value of theoutput wave, which isaconsiderable advantage forsome applications.
The third form ofvoltage-sensitive element was atungsten-filament diode operated inthe region ofsaturated emission.
The filament was heated bythe alternator output through atransformer, and the anode 564 PRIME POWER SUPPLIES FORRADAR [SEC.
14.5 excited from the d-c power supply.
The plate current varies inpro- portion tonearly the fourth power ofthe rms value ofthe alternator output voltage.
This provides avery sensitive signal voltage with avery short time constant ifthe filament isofsmall diameter.
Such adiode must beruggedly constructed inorder tomaintain themechanical spacing ofthetube elements, and thus thetube characteristics, even under severe mechanical vibration.
FIQ.14.7.—KS-15O55 electronic voltage regulator designed byBellTelephone Laboratories.
Aconventional amplifier isused which must have sufficient gain to provide the required over-all sensitivity.
Stable operation ofthe combination ofvoltage-sensitive element, amplifier, output stage, and alternator demands that the usual conditions forstability ofaservo system befulfilled.
Direct current excitation forthe alternator field isprovided bya controlled rectifier fedfrom thealternator output.
The controlled recti- fiermay beacombination oftransformer and rectifier controlled byasat- urable reactor, oritmay have grid-controlled thyratrons forrectification. SEC.
14.5] VOLTAGE REGULATORS 565 Bell Telephone Laboratories developed aregulated exciter, type KS-15055, which weighed about 12lbcomplete and was meant foruse with the PE-218 inverter.
(See Fig.
14.7.) Itregulated the 115-volt output toabout ~0.5volt rms, but had arather slow response and only fair temperature compensation.
The temperature compensation was improved inalater model.
General Electric Company developed asimilar regulator, type 3GVA1OBY1, forusewith PE-218-D inverters; itused asaturated-diode voltage-sensitive element.
(See Fig.
148.) This regulated the 115-volt output toabout +0.1volt rms and had good response and temperature characteristics, but thediode was sensitive tovibration.
A?@=% Inthelatter part of1944, more interest was shown inthedevelopment ofelectronic regulators because ofatrend toward the use ofengine- driven alternators that were toolarge forcontrol bycarbon-pile regulators unless separate exciter generators were used.
The ATSC Equipment Division atWright Field sponsored the development oftwo regulators tocontrol and excite engine-driven alternators rated 8kva, l-phase, 400 to800 cps, 115 volts a-c.
One developed byBell Laboratories weighed 33lb;itsoperation was reported tobevery satisfactory.
In1945 Radiation Laboratory undertook the development ofreg- ulators using asaturated-diode voltage-sensitive element and grid- controlled thyratrons inthe output.
The intention was toperfect a more orless universal regulator which could beapplied todifferent alternators bychanging the thyratron output.
The development had progressed tothe preliminary test model stage fortwo types; one type forsingle-phase inverters which had been applied tothe PU-7 2.5-kva machine, and one type for3-phase engine-driven alternators of6.5- to 12-kva rating.
The results were very promising, and itappears quite II 566 PRIME POWER SUPPLIES FOR RADAR [SEC.
14.5 certain that satisfactory electronic regulators can bedeveloped forsta- tionary ground generating equipment aswell asforairborne equipment.
Mechanical Voltage Regulators.—All mechanical voltage regulators are prone toimproper operation inthe presence ofvibration since they are sensitive devices that balance aspring against amagnetic force.
A mechanical voltage regulator consists oftwo principal elements: (I)a variable resistance inseries with the generator field, and (2)acontrol device, operating from the generator output voltage, which alters the andadjusting ‘Solenoid coil saewSLICw FIG.14.9.—Cross section ofcarbon-pile voltage regulator.
variable resistance tomaintain constant output voltage.
The two types ofregulators commonly used inaircraft arethe carbon-pile and the finger types.
Carbon-pile Regulator-s.-The carbon-pile regulator (Fig.
14.9) was first developed inEngland, where itisknown asthe Newton regulator after the inventor.
The variable resistance element consists ofastack ofcarbon disks orannular rings placed inaceramic ortempered-glass cylinder.
The cylinder ismounted inametal housing which serves to dissipate the heat from the pile and gives structural support.
One end ofthe pile rests against abutton held inplace byradial leaf springs; SEC.

The control element ofthe regulator isasolenoid coil and armature.
The current through the solenoid coil isproportional tothe voltage to beregulated, andthe pull ofitscore onthearmature isproportionalto the airgap between the two, and tothe coil current.

bletomechanical vibration and shock.
Most recent practice, therefore, istoadjust the regulator tooperate onthe right-hand side ofthe dip.
When carbon-pile regulators were first used oninverters they were mounted directly onthe rotating machine.
This gave rise toserious troubles because ofthe susceptibility ofthe regulator tovibration.
Vibration ofthe carbon pile causes amplitude modulation or“jitter” of 568 PRIME POWER SUPPLIES FORRADAR [SEC.
14.5 thea-cvoltage, which inaradar setshows upasspoking and blurring of the indicator scope (see Fig.
14.11).
The frequency ofthe modulation isnormally 30or40cps.
The maximum “jitter” which can betolerated isapproximately 1to1+volts.
The regulator should beshock-mounted asshown inFig.
14.12.
This procedure, together with adjustment ofthe regulator onthe tight side ofthedip, helps notonly inclearing upthetroubles mentioned above, but also inincreasing the interval between regulator adjustments, and inreducing thewear ofthe carbon disks.
The carbon-pile regulator isaffected bymoisture.
Moisture inthe carbon pile materially reduces the resistance, and frequently when a motor-alternator isstarted after having stood forsome time inanatmos- phere saturated with water vapor the output voltage ishigh—approxi- mately 135 to145 volts.
After the machine has run foranhour or longer, the moisture isusually driven offand the voltage returns to normal.
During this drying-out period the carbon disks are often sm.145] VOLTAGE REGULATORS 569 burned because, asthe film ofmoisture isgradually reduced, itmay break down atone particular point ontheface ofthedisk and the high current-density atthat point may besufficient toburn the disk.
In this event, the regulator pile must beremoved and the damaged disk replaced.

Inorder toreduce hunting, astabilizing transformer (Fig.
1413) isnow used with most of thelarger alternators.
Such atransformer provides acorrection depend- ingontherate ofchange ofexcitation.
The resistance ofthe carbon pile ranges from 2to60ohms.’ Its electrical rating isbased ontherate ofallowable heat dissipation, and is given inwatts.
The unit often used onaircraft inverters israted at 35watts.
Smaller inverters, notably the Eclipse 100- and 250-va units, useasmaller regulator rated at20watts, while 2500-va inverters use a 75-watt regulator, ofthe same physical size asthe 35-watt unit, but with fins toincrease the rate ofheat dissipation.
For the purpose of using asmaller regulator than would otherwise bepossible, the carbon pile canbeshunted with afixed resistor.
Such anarrangement increases therange ofresistance over which thecarbon pile must operate, and care must betaken that themaximum stable range ofthepileisnotexceeded.

The voltage isreduced either byasmall auto-trans- former orbyadropping resistor.’ Inany case, avariable resistor is used, either onthe a-cord-cside ofthe rectifier, toprovide avoltage adjustment whose range isapproximately 10volts.

Itisprobable that further development ofthe carbon-pile regulator can greatly extend the usefulness ofthe device.
Atthe close ofWorld War II,Leland Electric Company, ofDayton, Ohio, had developed experimental models ofimproved carbon-pile regulators that appeared tohave agreatly extended operating range ofresistance and improved resistance tohumidity ascompared toearlier service models.
Finger-type Regulators.

Speed Regulators.—The a-c frequency generated bymotor- alternator sets varies over awide range with changes ininput voltage, load, altitude, and temperature.
Athigh altitude, low temperatures and airdensities areencountered.
The low temperature tends tolower the speed byreducing the resistance ofthe motor field circuit, whereas low airdensity allows the speed LOincrease because oflower windage losses.

Inmost radar applications, such arange infrequency isnotobjection- able.
Certain indicator and computing circuits, however, require much closer regulation ofthe order of+2* per cent.
Good speed regulation also considerably reduces theproblem ofvoltage regulation.
Inaccord- ance with theneed forbetter speed characteristics ofinverters, thelatest Army-Navy specifications (AN-I-1O) stipulate the following frequency limits: For allvoltages between 26and 29volts and atany load from ~tofull, theallowed frequency limits foratemperature range of–10”C  574 PRIME POWER SUPPLIES FOR RADAR [SEC.

Dynamotors.—To supply smaller radar sets with moderate power atnotover 1000 or1200 volts, adynamotor isoften more econom- ical inweight and efficiency than aninverter.
Adynamotor has con- ventional d-cshunt- and series-field windings onthe stator and one or more armature windings onthe rotor.
The rotor winding isexcited through brushes and acommutator from theinput voltage.
Asingle rotor winding can betapped togive the required secondary voltage.
Alternatively, separate rotor windings can beused, with turns-ratios totheprimary winding chosen toprovide thecorrect output voltages.
The required d-c voltages are brought out through com- mutators from the secondary windings.
Dynamotors have been built i FIG.14.23 .—Eicor Inc.
aircraft dynamotor, togive voltages ashigh as2000 volts, but such machines meet severe difficulties with commutation and insulation.
Dual- and triple-output dynamotors arevery common, and several machines having four outputs (Fig.
14.23) have been built, but itisimpractical togobeyond this because ofthe large number ofwindings and commutators involved.
Dynamotors formilitary aircraft are built foraninput voltage of 27.5 volts.
For automobiles, commercial aircraft, and miscellaneous use, dynamotcrs arebuilt forinput voltages of6,12,32,and 110 volts.
Output ratings vary from 14orless toover 1200 volts, and from 30ma to5amp, with any combination oftwo, three, orfour atatime.
Weights vary from 5lb,foratotal output of20watts, to26lb,foranoutput of400 watts.
Efficiencies range from 40percent to60percent.

Inany multi-output dynamotor only one voltage can beregulated, but, except inthe event ofvery unevenly loaded circuits, the unregulated voltages will closely follow the regulated voltage.
Regulation can behandled in several ways: (1)alloutput circuits have windings onthe booster arma- ture although only one ofthem iscontrolled (Fig.
14”25); (2)only the voltage toberegulated has abooster winding; and (3)thevoltage tobe regulated isgenerated entirely inthe windings ofthe booster armature.
The third method ispractical only forlow voltages, because ofthelarge number ofturns and relatively high field current required togenerate a high voltage.
1 Over ranges ofinput voltage from 25to29volts, from noload to full load onthe dynamotor, the output-voltage change will beapproxi- mately 3per cent.
The booster armature and regulating field increase the size and weight ofthe dynamotor, but the regulator itself can be considerably smaller than aseries regulator because itcarries only “the field current rather than the line current.
14.8.
Vibrator Power Supplies.—If relatively small amounts ofpower arerequired, vibrator power supplies areuseful.
Conventional vibrators, such asthose used commercially inautomobile radios, are capable of supplying 50to60watts ofsquare-wave alternating current toatrans- former.
The transformer output may berectified and filtered tofurnish direct current ofappropriate voltage.
Vibrator power supplies can, unlike dynamotors, supply anumber of different d-c output voltages without disproportionate increase inthe weight ofthe power supply.
For example, itispossible tosupply 2500 volts direct current at5ma, 250volts d~rect current at100ma, and –150 volts direct current at5ma, atapproximately the same total weight as that required for conventional power supplies designed torun from 115-volt 60-cps a-c lines.
The vibrator power supply just described weighs from 6to8lb,depending onhow itispackaged and onthedegree offiltering required.
The output voltage ofavibrator power supply can beregulated by use ofthe series-tube type ofelectronic regulator, which isapt tobe wasteful ofpower.
Further, output power isconsumed bythe rectifier- tube cathodes.
Where anumber ofd-c output voltages are required, IInanycase, itisseldom practical toregulate thehighest-voltage output since current-limiting resistors arerequired intheregulator coilcircuit, andathigh voltages thelossinthem isexcessive.

14.9 rectifier cathodes may useupa)arge part ofthe50to60watts ofavail- able power.
Two ormore vibrator power supplies can bedesigned foroperation in series orinparallel onthe d-c output side, sothat larger currents or voltages can beobtained from small vibrators.
Large vibrators, capable ofsupplying 200 watts ormore from 12-to14-volt or24-to28-volt d-c supplies, areavailable, but itisusually more.
convenient touse conven- tional inverters with transformer-rectifier power supplies for outputs greater than 250 watts.
Vibrator power supplies usually give efficiencies of50to70percent, based ond-coutput vs.d-cinput.
Precautions must usually betaken toreduce radio interference from vibrator power supplies.
Small r-fchokes inthepower input leads, mica r-fbypass condensers oninput and output, and careful shielding and grounding usually provide adequate radio interference suppression for aircraft use.
Where extremely low noise level isrequired itmay be necessary toshield the vibrator, transformer, and each d-c ripple filter separately, and use r-fchokes ineach transformer connection.
How- ever, itisusually less troublesome tosuppress radio noise inavibrator supply than inasmall dynamotor.
Vibrators can beobtained inhermetically sealed containers, making it possible todesign power supplies foroperation under extreme conditions ofaltitude and humidity.
Production-type small vibrators are available with reed frequencies from about 100to115cps.
These vibrators have auseful lifeofatleast 500 hours when used with well-designed power supplies.
Vibrators have recently been developed with reed frequencies ofabout 180 cps.
Smaller transformers can beused atthis higher frequency, so than anover-all weight reduction of20to25per cent may beachieved.
The life ofsuch vibrators may besomewhat less than that oflow-fre- quency vibrators.

Summary ofRecommendations for Aircraft Radar Power.
1.Consider the radar-radio power-supply problem ofaspecific air- craft asawhole.
What dynamotor can beeliminated? What inverters can becombined? Isallequipment uniformly designed tooperate from one standard a-csource? Often enough weight can besaved tojustify such refinements asanelectronic voltage regulator.
2.Use adirect-driven generator whenever possible, either atconstant frequency (ifairplane issoequipped) oratvariable frequency.
If SEC.
1410] FIXED LOCATIONS 583 portions ofthe installation require fixed frequency, consider an auxiliary d-ctoa-cmotor-alternator.
3.Use electronic voltage regulation forengine generators ormotor alternators.
4.Consider vibrators forsmall loads.
GROUND AND SHIPBOARD SYSTEMS Power forground radar systems should beobtained from commercial electric service whenever possible, with certain precautions outlined below.
The general problem ofpower supply forground radar falls into four main groupings: 1.Fixed locations with commercial electric service available.
2.Large systems (with requirements forhighly dependable service under allconditions) atfixed locations without commercial electric service, orformobile use.
3.Small systems foruseinfixed locations without commercial power, orformobile use.
4.Small ultraportable mobile sets.
Inselecting aspecific engine-generator set, orany specific alternator, serious consideration must begiven tothe specifications ofthe set(the alternator inparticular) ifsatisfactory performance and characteristics aretobeobtained.
One good tabulation ofstandard Army power sup- plies isSignal “Corps Manual TM 11-223.
However, most ofthe sets listed therein were not originally designed with radar inmind.
Accord- ingly, their electrical performance may not meet radar needs without modification.
Afuller discussion ofthe factors involved inchoosing alternators and engine-generator sets isgiven inVol.

14.10.
Fixed Locations.-Commercial power supply forradar installa- tions must beprovided with three major considerations inmind: (1)reli- ability required, (2)voltage stability ofsupply, (3)interference from common loads.
Reliability.—If extremely reliable service must beprovided, com- mercial service from afirst-grade public utility ismost satisfactory, pro- vided that itisbacked upbyemergency feeders duplicating normal service (preferably byanalternate route) toanetwork station ofthe public-utility system.
Anemergency engine-alternator set(which may bemade automatic-starting ifdeemed necessary) should also beprovided.
This arrangement ispreferable toconstant reliance onlocal generation.
Aregular maintenance schedule must befollowed, with the emergency engine operated foraminimum ofone hour per week atnoload and a 584 PRIME POWER SUPPLIES FOR RADAR [SEC.
14.11 minimum oftwo hours per month atfull load.
For such emergency service asthat outlined, gasoline-powered prime movers arereliable and satisfactory.
Voltage Stability ofSupply.—If the service isobtained from asource unstable involtage, Iocalvoltage stabilization must reemployed.
Ifthe voltage changes take place slowly, without transients, they can beelimi- nated bymeans ofinduction regulators, with automatic ormanual con- trol; tapped autotransformers, manual orservo-driven; or(for small loads) variacs.
For example, consider theuseofcommercial power bya remote beacon station served byaline shared with other power users.
Asnight falls, increasing load ontheline lowers thevoltage atthebeacon.
Servo-driven variacs have proved useful insuch asituation.
Interference fromCommon Loads.—If theloads sharing power service with the radar impose high intermittent demands, and especially ifthe total capacity ofthe system islow with respect tothese loads, serious transient interference may beencountered.
Anisolating motor-gener- ator istheonly satisfactory solution forsuch difficulties.
Ifsynchronous frequency isnot essential, induction-motor drive ispreferable tothe greater complexity ofasynchronous motor.
Itisgood practice, where possible, tomake input and output services identical, and toprovide means forbypassing theisolating setincase oftrouble.
That is,ifthe main service is220 volts, 3-phase, 60cycles, the motor-generator set should be220-volt 3-phase input (60cycles) to220-volt 3-phase output (58cycles).
14.11.
Large Systems Where NoCommercial Power IsAvailable.— Where 24-hour operation ofaprime mover isrequired, itisnecessary to provide duplicate power generation equipment, regular and emergency.
Such equipment should beinterchangeable, and the two sets should be used alternately toensure reliable service.
Where extreme reliability is desired, three engines should befurnished; one canthen bedisassembled formaintenance without risking complete system breakdown iftheservice engine fails.
Generators ofasize atleast t~vice theestimated load should always beprovided, topermit future additions ofauxiliary devices not initially specified.
Diesel engines are definitely more reliable forcon- tinuous operation than gasoline engines.
Diesel fuel and diesel exhaust fumes areless hazardous.
Electric power forloads larger than 7.5kva should be208/120-volt 3-phase 60-cycle alternating current.
Itisdesirable touse 3-phase 60-cycle because electric motors ofthis rating arecompact and simple to operate.
Weight savings inrectifier-filter supplies canusually beachieved with 3-phase power, ifthis isimportant.
For large mobile systems itiswell toinvestigate availability ofstan- dard U.S.
Army power-supply units.
Unfortunately, the voltage SEC.14.13] ULTRAPORTABLE UNITS 585 regulators insuch systems arealmost uniformly unsatisfactory forradar equipment since they have atendency toproduce modulation inthe amplitude ofthe a-cvoltage.
Itisoften necessary toresort tohand rheostat control oftheexciter field orthe alternator field.
Radar loads areusually constant ornearly so,and hand control requires only occa- sional adjustment after,the equipment has come tonormal operating temperature.
Theengines areusually provided with flyball-type speed governors which are satisfactory when well maintained, and keep the output frequency within arange ofabout 58to62cps.
14.12.
Smder Mobfle Units.-If highreliability isrequired, thesame considerations must beobserved inthis case asinthe case oflarge systems, notwithstanding theweight penalty.
For example, anavigation aidrequired tooperate 24hours per day under allconditions must use conservative, long-lived prime movers and beprovided with standby equipment, though itmay consume only 75o watts.
Much design effort has been expended onpackaging units ofabout 500-lb weight and 5-kw output inareadily portable form, There has also been much development oftwo-cycle gasoline engines for power units uptoabout 2-kw output.
Itislikely that two-cycle engines coupled to400-cps generators will beavailable inthe future inmany ratings; these units aremuch lighter and more compact than four-cycle engines with 60-cps generators ofequivalent rating.
Itistrue that two-cycle engines have some disadvantages.
They areoften more difficult tostart than the small four-cycle engines, and, because oftheir tendency tofoul exhaust ports and spark plugs, they are likely torequire more maintenance.
However, asmobile units, they have two advantages over and above their lightness ofweight and their compactness.
They are easier torepair inthe field and require less replacement ofparts than the four-cycle engines, which are subject to valve-fouling and burning.
14.13.
Ultraportable Units.—Where extremely light weight isrequired this can beobtained only bysacrificing reliability orbyshortening the required period ofoperation.
Ultraportable ground radar systems usually need very little power.
Where only afew hours ofoperation are required, the systems can be powered bysmall storage batteries which operate vibrator power supplies ordynamotors.
Where longer operation isrequired, very small two-cycle engines con- nected topermanent-magnet-field 400-cps generators have been developed bytheJacobsen Manufacturing Company, Racine, Wis., and theJudson Manufacturing Company, Philadelphia, Pa.
Jacobsen produces aunit rated 125 watts 400 cps weighing about 13lb.
Asingle-cylinder, air-cooled, two-cycle engine isdirect-connected 586 PRIME POWER SUPPLIES FOR RADAR [SEC.
1414 toapermanent-magnet generator.
The speed iscontrolled byan air-vane governor.
Judson produces several small models, one ofwhich israted 150watts 400 cps and weighs about 15lb.
The general design issimilar tothat of the Jacobsen machine, except that the engine isbelt-connected tothe generator.
There isnoway ofregulating theoutput voltage ofpermanent-magnet generators, but capacity inseries with the output will hold the output voltage constant toabout i5per cent despite changing load.
The voltage can bealtered tocompensate fortemperature changes bymanual adjustment ofthespeed governor ontheengine.
Work has been initiated onthe development ofsmall prime movers other than conventional gasoline engines.
Small steam engines that were capable ofabout 300 mechanical watts output were built byRadia- tion Laboratory, but nosatisfactory boiler had been developed atthe close ofactivity.
Small steam engines and gas turbines areattractive because oftheir ease ofcontrol and flexibility.
Further development would probably produce some worth-while small prime movers.
14.14.
Ship Radar Systems.—The problem ofproviding power for large shipborne radar systems isprincipally that ofstability.
Most modern warships have 440-volt, 3-phase, 60-cps power supply which is subject totransient fluctuations of10to20percent involtage and per- haps 5per cent infrequency.
Transients are caused bythe sudden application oflarge loads such asgun turret drives and airplane elevators.
Good results have been obtained bypowering theradar system from a 60-cycle motor-generator set.
Aninduction motor isused todrive the alternator; when not heavily loaded, themot orshows arelatively small change inspeed for achange ininput voltage.
Motor speed tends tofollow achange infrequency, but themechanical inertia ofthe setis usually adequate tohold upthe speed during the usual short-period frequency transients.
The induction motor rating should beabout 50per cent larger than that required todrive the alternator.
Itis desirable tohave the alternator output the same asthe ship’s power so that theradar system can beoperated directly from the ship’s supply in case ofbreakdown ormaintenance shutdown ofthemotor-alternator set.
The motor may bedirect-coupled orbelt-connected tothealternator; usually direct coupling ispreferred because ofitssimplicity.
The output frequency ofadirect-connected alternator will beless than 60cpsbythe slip ofthe induction motor.
This results inanoutput frequency of 57to58cps, which isnormally satisfactory forthe operation oftrans- formers orother 60-cycle equipment.
There isnoreally satisfactory means now available forregulating the output voltage ofthe alternator.
Most ofthe available voltage regu- SEC.
l’k~~] SHIPRADAR SYSTEMS 587 lators have atendency tobeunstable, exhibiting rapid hunting ofabout 20to40cps.
This may not betroublesome onlighting ormotor loads, butitisoneofthemajor causes ofspoking ofPPI displays and instability ofother forms ofradar presentation.
One method ofusing regulators has been followed with some degree ofsuccess.
That istoprovide arheostat inseries with the regulating resistance ofthe regulator inthe field circuit.
Assuming that 115-volt output isdesired, theregulator can beadjusted toregulate at118to120 volts and enough resistance cut in,bymeans ofthe rheostat, sothat the voltage is115 volts atfull radar load with everything atnormal operating temperature.
Under normal operating conditions, then, the regulator isallout and not functioning.
Ifthe voltage should rise, as during warmup period orwhen the radar isonstand-by, the regulator will cutinwhen the voltage comes upto118 to120 volts and prevent further riseinvoltage.
Ifthere isaload greater than normal causing the output voltage todrop, the manual rheostat will have tobeadjusted.
However, with the motor-generator setacting asanelectromechanical flywheel totake uptransient fluctuations inthe ship’s power supply, operation isreasonably steady and satisfactory. EXAMPLES BY R.G.CHAPTER 15 OF RADAR SYSTEM DESIGN HERB AND R.L.SINSHEIMER , 16.1.
Introduction.-The development ofanew radar system may be called forbecause ofrecognition ofanew application forwhich radar has not been used but for which itssuccessful use appears possible.
In other cases, adevelopment may bejustified foranapplication where radar isinsuccessful usebut where improved results could beexpected bythe use ofmore modern equipment.
Early ideas dnanew system and initial proposals may come from a development laboratory orfrom the potential users ofthe equipment.
Before design characteristics can besuccessfully crystallized, regardless oftheorigin ofaproposal, there must beanextensive interplay ofideas and ofinformation between specialists inthe following categories: (1) application specialists representing thepotential using organization, who must contribute necessary information ondesirable performance char- acteristics, limitations onsize, weight, and power consumption, and limitations onthe number and skill ofoperators and maintenance men; (2)component specialists, who must contribute information onthestatus ofdevelopment and onthelimitations ofthemany component parts that make upacomplete system; (3)system specialists with experience inthe design and operation ofradar systems.
Normally aman experienced insystem design isbest able tocoordinate the over-all development project.
Hemust have asupporting group of experienced systems men toassist onthedesign problem and tocarry out operational test work that may bedesirable, and hemust have the con- tinued advice and support ofspecialists ofthe first two categories listed above.
Versatility .—Initial planning foraradar system may bemade with one specific application inmind.
Asplans progress, possibilities of related applications aregenerally recognized and consideration isgiven toincluding facilities that improve thesystem inversatility.
The value ofversatility has been amply demonstrated, not only formeeting related applications but formeeting changing conditions frequently encountered inthecentral application.
Provision forversatility, unless ingeniously made, may cost heavily inincreased complexity, size, orweight; further, theutility ofthesetfor 588 SEC.
151] INTRODCCTIO,\- 589 theprincipal application may suffer.
How fartogowith such provisions and how best toinclude them areproblems that frequently outweigh in importance any other design problem.
N-orules can begiven forguid- ance along these lines, butthedegree ofsuccess tobeexpected will depend markedly onthe extent towhich development specialists are familiar with problems ofoperation intheusing organization and onthedegree to which representatives ofthe using organizations have become familiar with thetechnical problems, thepossibilities, and thelimitations ofradar.
Requirements forComponent Development.
—With sufficient care in design and asufficiently conservative policy, aradar setmight bedesigned making use ofonly those components onwhich development work has been completed.
Ordinarily the improvement tobegained insystem performance oringeneral utility byimprovement incertain components is sufficient towarrant component development work.
The extent to which such requirements can safely beincluded must bedetermined from consideration ofthetime schedule tobemet and from acareful, realistic appraisal ofthe development time needed.
Sound system-design work, together with performance tests, can serve inavaluable way todirect component-development work along themost advantageous lines.
Detailed Problems inDesign.
—General rules forguidance onthemany detailed problems encountered inthe development ofaradar system would beextremely difficult toformulate because ofthe multiplicity of applications with radically differing requirements.
Information accu- mulated through experience onalarge number ofsystems can bepre- sented most easily byoutlining the development ofsuccessful systems from theearly-idea stage onthrough totheir operational use.
Two typical system developments are described inthis chapter: (I)ahigh-performance ground-based setforairsurveillance and control; and (2)the AN”/APS-10, alightweight airborne setforairnavigation.
Considerations leading tothe selection ofthese systems areasfollows: 1.Substantial development and design effort went into both systems and important advances resulted.
2.Both systems arerelatively simple, and design problems encoun- tered intheir development are more basic innature and more generally applicable than inthe case ofamore elaborate system, where usually alarge proportion ofthe system isvery specialized innature.
3.These two systems represent opposite extremes inrequirements.
Limitations onfactors such assize, \veight, and power requirements fortheground-based setwere largely subordinated totherequire- ment forthe best possible radar performance.
Inthe case ofthe airborne set, severe limits were imposed onweight, size, and similar 590 EXAMPLES OF RADAR SYSTEM DESIG.V [SEC.
152 factors, and theingenuity ofthedevelopment and design men was taxed tomeet the minimum acceptable radar performance within these limits.
Adetailed treatment offurther systems beyond these two would be ofquestionable value, since changing requirements may soon make obsolete allbut themore general, basic developments ofthepast.
Radi- cally new requirements will bemet only byradically new developments, and tobefirmly bound bypast experience would stifle progress.
Ingen- ious technical men with good facilities, free intheir thinking, working in close touch with using organizations, fully informed onoperational problems and planning—these aretheimportant requirements forfuture advances.
15.2.
The Need forSystem Testing.
‘—One general remark concerning system design issufficiently important tobemade before taking upthe design examples.
Noradar system iscomplete until adequate provisions forperformance testing and maintenance have been made and appropriate maintenance procedures prescribed.
The most important function oftest equipment inradar maintenance istopermit quantitative measurement ofthose properties ofthesystem which affect itsrange performance.
Experience has shown that itis essential todetermine byreliable quantitative methods how well aradar is operating.
Under most circumstances, the important units oftest equipment should bebuilt into theradar inaway that permits their most convenient use.
Iflimitations ofweight and bulk donot permit theuse ofbuilt-in test equipment, suitable test points should beprovided to permit convenient and adequate tests tobeperformed frequently onthe important parts ofthesystem.
RadarPerformance Figure.—The ratio ofP,the pulse power ofthe radar transmitter, toSmin, the power ofthe minimum detectable signal, isameasure oftheradar performance.
This isthefundamental quantity studied intests.
The radar equation given asEq.
(2.M), R d4pnL4 ?f, ~,x.
— sm,ArA”(1) shows that allfactors except Pand tl~,n areeither invariable orbeyond our control once theradar has been designed.
Aquantity closely related toSmin isusually measured rather than Sti~ itself.
This maybe thepower oftheweakest test signal that can be detected, orofatest signal that produces some other easily reproducible effect.
Because ofthe effects ofpresentation time and pulse width ~ByR.D.O’Neal andJ,M.Wolf. SEC, 152] NEED FOR SYSTEM TESTING 591 (Sees.
210 and 211), such test signals aregenerally not equal toSmirs but differ from itbyaconstant ratio, The ratio between pulse power and the power ofsuch atest signal, P/ST,expressed indecibels, iscalled the “radar performance figure” and isasuitable measure ofthe ability of thesystem toseeradar targets.
Figure 15.1 shows the range performance onvarious types ofradar targets asafunction ofthe radar performance figure.
Asexplained in Chap.
2,radar range performance does notalways follow thefourth-power law ofEq.
(1), but theperformance figure remains ofvital importance in determining what fraction ofthe maximum radar range canberealized byagiven system against agiven type oftarget, regardless ofthe existing propagation conditions.
TheInadequacy ofGuessing Per- formance.—It hasoften been wrongly assumed that over-all radar perform- ance can beadequately judged with- out using test equipment bymeans ofone ofthe following “rule-of- thumb” criteria: (1) the general appearance ofthe picture seen on the radar indicator, (2)the maxi-oo- Dechisbelowratedperformance FIG.
15.1.—Relation between radar performance deficit and available radar range for various types oftarget.
mum range atwhich target signals canbeseen, or(3)thesignal strength above noise ofthe echo from a“standard” target.
Both (1)and (2)are strongly affected bychanges inpropagation conditions’ aswell asbyinterference effects resulting from composite targets,’ tidal changes,3 etc.
Although the effect ofanomalous propaga- tion can bepractically eliminated bychoosing anear-by weak target signal asastandard, such afavorable choice of’‘standard target” does not necessarily eliminate interference effects.
Targets that donotshow such effects insome degree areexceedingly rare.
These rule-of-thumb criteria areinadequate forthe consistent judg- ment ofradar performance, ashas been shown bysurveys ofradar performance made onradar equipment inthe field during the war.
Unfortunately during most ofthe war adequate test equipment was commonly lacklng; when itwas present, itwas often incharge ofinade- quately trained maintenance personnel who didnot appreciate the need forusing itregularly.
Figure 15.2 shows the combined results ofa 1SeeSec.

Figure 15.3 shows thefindings ofamore recent (July 1945) survey covering 10-cm ship radars; itindi- cates that there had been nochange forthebetter.
Such serious deficiencies inactual field radar performance emphasize the fact that the use oftest equipment tomeasure performance and to trace down thecauses ofimpaired performance had notbeen incorporated into routine maintenance practice formost radar sets atthe end ofthe 01Lo 10 20 30 40 Oedels below ratedperformance?%6* z ~4 2 22 0k o 10 20 30 40 Oeabels below rated performance FIG.

Such important losses inperformance are glaringly inconsistent with thegreat effort expended inradar design toattain high performance.

DESIGN OFAHIGH-PERFORMANCE RADAR FOR AIR SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL 15.3.
Initial Planning and Objectives.
Formtdation ofRequirements.
Atarelatively early stage inthe development ofmicrowave techniques consideration was given tothepossibility ofapplying them totheproblem oflong-range airsurveillance.
Greatly improved azimuth resolution, minimization ofground “clutter, ”and improved low-angle coverage were the principal advantages that microwaves appeared tooffer, The best SEC, 153] INITIAL PLANNING AND OBJECTIVES 593 output pulse powers were then low, receiver sensitivities were poor, and system problems were notwell understood.
Coverage equal toorbetter then that provided bythe longer-wave equipment then inuse orunder development appeared tobeattainable only bymeans ofextremely high antenna gain.
Asthese ideas developed, microwave techniques were rapidly advanc- ing.
Requirements forantenna gain andsize \verereduced tomderate values, and finally computations supported bymeasurement showed that amicrowave system could satisfactorily meet the coverage problem.
Work was then initiated leading tothe production ofaground radar, which proved tobeone ofthemost successful sets ever developed.
Its design characteristics were sowell chosen that, even with the best techniques available attheend ofthewar, itcould noteasily besurpassed forairsurveillance and control.
Asinseveral other system developments involving great advances over previous equipment, requirements onthis set were not firmly specified during thedevelopmental stage.
Inmany respects this freedom from rigid requirements was advantageous.
General objectives were clear, the design men were well situated todraw freely foradvice and help oncomponent specialists and onmen familiar with operational needs, and theywere largely free tousetheir own ingenuity and judgment to meet themany problems that were presented.
General Objectives.—The principal objectives can bestated simply as follows: Coverage was considered tobeimportant both astomaximum detection range and astothe altitude region included, but resolution in azimuth and inrange were thought tobeofcomparable importance.
Where height information was desired, auxiliary height finders were tobe used; thus the radar beam could befixed inelevation and swept contin- uously inazimuth byrotation oftheantenna.
Estimates ofdetailed requirements were difficult tomake inregard to characteristics such as(1)accuracy ofrange and bearing values asdeter- mined bymethods ofdata presentation, (2)interval between “looks” atthetarget asdetermined bytherevolutions perminute oftheantenna, and (3)traffic-handling capacity asdetermined bythenumber and type of indicators provided.
The designers, however, adopted asageneral policy the improvement orextension beyond current practice ofequipment characteristics that determined theaccuracy and speed ofdata presenta- tion and use.
Care was also taken inthe design topermit still greater extension ofthese facilities bysimple changes oradditions.
Beam Shape in Elevation.—A large air-surveillance set must be located onthe ground orbeelevated atmost byalow tower toavoid interference by!ocal obstruct ion.
The radar beam inik360° sweep may look over land, over water, orover both land and water.
Figure 15.4 594 EXAMPLES OFRADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.
153 shows the general form ofbeam shape that gives the most desirable type ofcoverage under these conditions.
Itslower edge isdetermined bythe optical horizon, with corrections foratmospheric refraction and interference due tosurface reflection.
Atadistance dinland miles from the radar set, the horizon height hinfeet isgiven byh=~dzfor normal atmospheric refraction (neglecting the interference effect, which issmall formicrowaves; seeSec.
2.13).
Reduction ofthe blind region below this lower edge bylocating thesetonhigh terrain maybe advanta- geous where the coverage islargely over water, but foroverland surveil- lance this recourse isseverely limited because ofpermanent echoes, which can mask out allreturn inregions where the radar beam isinter- cepted byland surfaces.

Insetting adesirable limit forthe upper contour fordetection ofa given type ofaircraft itwas, necessary tobalance the value ofhigh coverage against coverage inrange, since adding toone subtracts from the other unless the designer chooses toincrease the complexity ofthe equipment.
For operations duting World War II,provision fordetection ofafour-engine plane atallaltitudes upto35,000 ftwas desirable, and this value was taken todetermine the upper section CD ofFig.
15.4.
Increasing theelevation angle ofsection AD ofthecontour does notadd greatly tothe radar coverage requirements, since the region issmall; but practical difficulties ofantenna design are encountered.
Since close-in regions have been inthepast largely masked out bypermanent echoes, anangle of30°was considered acceptable.
With theupper and lower limits ofthe contour determined, the problem was now topush themaximum range outtothebest possible value.
Adetection range of180 miles forafour-engine aircraft appeared to bethe best that could beexpected, and the contour thus determined is SEC.
15.4] THE RANGE EQUATION 595 notunduly difficult tofitbybeam-shaping.
Even greater coverage both inrange and height was known tobedesirable, but itappeared tobe attainable only byexcessive antenna size orbyanexcessive multiplicity ofseparate radar beams, each with itsown transmitter and receiver system.
Amicrowave setwith the coverage shown inFig.
15.4 presented a very difficult problem.
Because ofuncertainty inmeasurements and intheoutcome ofcomponent development, there was nofirm assurance that itcould bemet.
The success oftheundertaking, however, was not dependent onmeeting this coverage fully, since maximum range and altitude values within 20per cent ofthe values ofFig.
15.4 would have represented amajor advance over any previous equipment.
Failure to detect one heavy plane above 30,000 ftwould have limited theutility of theequipment forspecial problems, but, because ofthepractice ofgroup flying, thenormal problem was much less severe.
Azimuth Beamwidth.—The usefulness oftheradar setforsurveillance was expected toimprove intraffic-handling capacity, inability to resolve closely spaced aircraft, inaccuracy ofdata, and inreduction of ground clutter, astheazimuth beamwidth was decreased.
The desirable lower limit was expected tobesetonly from considerations ofapractical upper limit toantenna size and requirements ofmechanical accuracy.
Results obtained fully confirmed these conclusions forbearnwidths down to1°athalf power, but inalater section ofthis chapter weshall seethat qualifications may beintroduced iffuture development isextended to beams much narrower.
Miscellaneous Requirements.
—Although limitations onsize, complex- ity,weight, and power consumption could besubordinated totherequire- ment forexcellence inradar performance, the designers were fully aware ofthe importance ofpractical limitations onthese characteristics.
It was also well understood that without great care and effort toachieve the utmost insimplicity, dependability, convenient facilities fortest, and ease ofmaintenance, the equipment might fail togive satisfactory field service.
Incomputations leading tothe choice ofsystem parameters the designers did not have the advantage ofmuch information that isnow available, yet inpractically every case their decisions were excellent.
The discussion ofdesign now given will make use ofup-to-date informa- tion notavailable tothedesigners.
This procedure ishelpful forclarity ofpresentation and will make the analysis more generally applicable.

The Range Equation.-There will now beundertaken adetailed discussion ofconsiderations leading tothechoice ofvalues forthefollow- ingsystem parameters: (1)pulse length, (2)pulse recurrence frequency, (3)azimuth scanning, rate, (4)azimuth beamwidth, (5)beam shape in 596 EXAMPLES OF RADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.

We shall make useoftheequation that gives themaximum detection range ofasystem asafunction ofthe system parameters.
The range equation (see Sec.

arenow reasonably well established, and, since other quantities determining R-,can bereadily measured, Eq.

The safer practice, however, istocompute coverage relative tothe range performance onsimilar targets ofasystem with asimilar scan, which has been carefully checked astocomponent performance.
This procedure will befollowed, and Eq.
(1)will beused only forthe relationships itestablishes among thesystem parameters.
15-5.
Choice ofPulse Length.-The pulse length isconvenient for first consideration since itsrelations with the other parameters are relatively simple.
Itenters therange equation through itseffect onthe value ofS~~; this quantity normally varies inversely with pulse length since the receiver bandwidth, ifchosen foroptimum performance, isan inverse function ofpulse length.
Before proceeding further with the analysis, adiscussion ofother quantities ~hat influ~nce the value of approximation forthe problem under varies inversely with thesquare root of thetarget.Stim will beuseful.
Toagood consideration, the value ofS~~ thenumber ofpulses perscan on SEC.15.5] where N.= “r= e= ~=597 CHOICE OF PULSE LENGTH thenumber ofpulses perscan onthetarget, pulse recurrence frequency, azimuth beamwidth indegrees between half-power points, and scan rate indegrees persecond, weobtain therelation J-Sti, .

(4) The average power output isgiven byPrv,.
Itisdesirable todrive thetransmitter ofahigh-performance ground- based system atthe highest pulse power and the highest average power that itwill safely withstand.
The value ofR-can then beincreased by anincrease inpulse length and acorresponding reduction inthe pulse recurrence rate, leaving average power and pulse power fixed attheir highest safe values.
Limitations onpulse length areimposed bythe following considera- tions: 1.
2.
3.
4.The minimum range difference atwhich two targets canberesolved vanes directly with pulse length.
With al-~sec pulse, aircraft inseparable inazimuth can beresolved ifthey differ inrange by more than 164 ydplus asmall distance which depends onthe characteristics ofthe receiver and the indicator.
With a5-psec pulse, this limit for resolution becomes 820 ydplus the same additive constant.
The intensity ofcloud return relative tosignal return from planes varies directly with pulse length (Sec.
3.10).
The coverage area obscured byground clutter will increase aspulse length isincreased.
Magnetron behavior has been found tobecome more critical, and requirements onthe voltage pulse from the modulator tobecome more exacting, with increasing pulse length. 598 EXAMPLES OF RADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.
15.6 5.Effects ofpulse interference are more difficult toeliminate ifthe receiver bandwidth isnarrow, asrequired forbest sensitivity with along pulse.
6.Ifareduction inthe pulse recurrence frequency isrequired to increase pulse length, the azimuth accuracy may beadversely affected and means forthe selective detection ofmoving targets may beless effective (Chap.
16).
Consideration ofallthese points leads tothe conclusion that apulse length greater than about 2psec istobeavoided.
Upper limits imposed onpulse power and onthe pulse recurrence frequency have been such that adecrease inpulse length below 1~sec would require adecrease inaverage power below the maximum safe value, resulting inadecrease ofR-,.Further, asweshall see, al-psec pulse yields adiscrimination inrange which is,formost ofthe area covered bythe radar, roughly equal tothe azimuth discrimination afforded bythe beamwidth chosen.
This isdesirable from the stand- point oftheindicator.
Apulse length of1psec was finally chosen forthefollowing reasons: 1.Average power output was pushed tothe safe upper limit forthe transmitter with avalue of750 kwforpulse power, apulse recur- rence frequency of400, and al-~sec pulse length.
2.Reduction ofthe pulse recurrence frequency to200 with acorre- sponding increase ofpulse length to2psec would have given an appreciable increase inR~,.ifthis change ledtonoreduction in pulse power orinaverage power.
Since the magnetron then available performed better both inpulse power and inaverage power at1psec than at2psec, therealization ofany improvement inR-,would have been doubtful.
3.The many advantages ofashort pulse were thought tooutweigh any small increase incoverage which alonger pulse appeared to offer.
16.6.
Pulse Recurrence Frequency .—The requirement ofanadequate time interval forpresentation ofdata usually serves tosetthe upper limit tothepulse recurrence frequency.
Sufficient indicator sweep-time must beprovided topresent signals without overlapping out toapproxi- mately the maximum range ofdetection.
To the longest indicator sweep-time desired must beadded sufficient time forrecovery ofthe indicator sweep circuits, inorder toarrive attheminimum time interval between pulses.
Additional allowance must bemade forany departure from regularity inmodulator firing.
Presentation ofa200-mile range was desirable, giving atime interval of2140 psec forthesweep.
Anadditional 360 psec was added forindica- SEC.

Thus, the value ofV,was setclose tothe permissible maximum foraradar setwith a200-mile range.
For some applications, presentation ofgreater range would have been helpful.
Apulse recurrence frequency of350 or300, permitting range presentation to250 or300 miles, would have reduced R-very little, but thecharacteristics ofthe modulator chosen restricted v,to400.
A value ofv,of350 or300 would bedesirable from thestandpoint ofindi- cator range presentation forafuture radar system ofthis general type, buttwo other factors favoring higher v,must beconsidered: 1.The limiting accuracy ofazimuth-angle determinations isapproxi- mately half ofthe angular separation between pulses.
Ascan rate of360/see with aV,of400 gives anangular separation between pulses of0.09°.
The contribution ofthis effect toazimuth error would beabout 0.045°, which isnegligible fornormal surveillance and control.
Inoperations requiring very precise control of aircraft this error would beappreciable, and ifitwere doubled bydecreasing the v,to200theresulting error might beahandicap.
2.Cancellation ofechoes from stationary objects byMT1 means is less effectively achieved asthe number ofpulses per scan onthe target (N”,.) decreases (Chap.
16).
Ifthescan rate is360/see, with abeamwidth athalf power of1.00 and aV,of400, NWwill have a value of11,which isabout the lower limit, forsatisfactory per- formance ofMT1.
16.7.
Azimuth Scan Rate .—Although therelation Smim - dazimuth scanning rate was notyetestablished atthetime ofthedevelopment here described, it was roughly understood; and itput ahigh premium onslow scanning rates.
Mechanical problems inconnection with the antenna mount are greatly simplified byaslow scan rate.
Strongly opposing these considerations isthe operational need for more complete and up-to-the-second information, inorder tofollow continuously the movement ofhigh-speed aircraft and tocontrol their movements intelligently.
Control problems vary indifficulty from that ofawell-formed group ofaircraft moving over asimple course to that presented bythe requirement foraccurate following orcontrol of numerous aircraft moving over complex independent courses.
Aplane flying 300 mph moves $mile in10see, or2*miles in30sec.
Data at30-sec intervals, asgiven byascan rate of2rpm, was considered 600 EXAMPLES OFRADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.
15.8 adequate forasimple tracking orcontrol problem, but complex problems clearly called forhigher scan rates even attheexpense ofcoverage.
Foreseeing awide range ofapplications forthenew radar equipment, itsdesigners provided anantenna drive bymeans ofwhich the scanning rate could beadjusted over therange from 1to6rpm.
For one wartime application that involved only simple tracking and control problems but put ahigh premium onrange performance, ascan rate of2rpm was used exclusively.
Other sets, which were used formore complex prob- lems, were commonly runat4rpm.
Operation at6rpm was very limited because ofmechanical difficulty.
There isnow good evidence that ascan rate of6rpm isdesirable for complex tracking and control, and even higher rates should beadvanta-c geous.
Mechanical difficulties athigh scan rates and requirements for high azimuth accuracy will probably conspire tosetanupper limit on future scanning rates.
Infact rates above 6rpm may beentirely ruled out bythese limitations.
15.8.
Choice ofBeam Shape.
Azimuth Beamwidth.—The merits of anarrow beam aresowidely understood that they will not bediscussed indetail here.
Allmicrowave development isrecognition ofthe impor- tance ofangular resolution.
Aswavelength isdecreased, beamwidths obtainable with antennas ofpractical size are decreased.
With the development ofamicrowave ground radar, the beamwidth foralong- range airsurveillance setwas pushed down byanorder ofmagnitude from values previously used forthis application, and results were spectacularly successful.
The setdescribed here had anantenna aperture 25ftwide and operated inthe 10.7-cm wavelength region, giving abeamwidth of approximately 1.00.
“Itwill beofinterest toseehow fardevelopment toward increasingly sharper beams might usefully becarried, and toestablish asclosely as possible the optimum beamwidth foralong-range air-surveillance set.
Itcan readily beshown that alower limit, and therefore anoptimum value, exists, entirely apart from questions ofmechanical difficulty.
Ascanning rate of360/see gives anangular motion of0.07° between transmission ofapulse and return ofthe echo from atarget at200-mile range.
Ifthe beamwidth were much less than 0.07°, the antenna gain forreception ofthesignal would begreatly below normal.
For abeam- width ofabout 0.15° or0.2° this effect becomes negligible, and the limit itsets onbeamwidth isprobably not ofpractical importance.
Asimilar and more important fundamental limitation onbeamwidth isdetermined bythe requirement that atleast one pulse hitthe target perscan, with thebeam axis offinangle from thetarget bynomore than asmall fraction ofthe beamwidth.
Atascanning rate of360/see and av,of400, the angular separation between pulses is0.09°, and for SEC.

If wavelength isdecreased below the 10-cm region tosharpen the beam, coverage requirements will become more difficult tomeet, even with the assumption that component performance isindependent ofwavelength.

15.8] CHOICE OF BEAM SHAPE 603 provided byaddition ofathird system, but the additional complexity was thought tobeoperationally not worth itscost.
Reflection ofradiation from the earth’s surface greatly influences theradar beam characteristics inelevation angle, and such effects must begiven careful consideration.
Over water, the reflection coefficient is high forallwavelengths ofinterest forairsurveillance, and forvery small angles ofincidence itcan beassumed tobe100 per cent.
Over land, thereflection coefficient varies markedly with detailed surface shape and with thecomposition oftheterrain, and ingeneral increases with increas- ing wavelength.
Adequate data are not available onthe reflection coefficient, butatwavelengths of10cmorlessitisassumed tobenormally negligible, and atafew meters itisnormally substantial.

Effective antenna height is100 ft.

The detailed effects ofsurface reflection which influence coverage are very complex.
Some ofthe more important effects and conclusions aresummarized below (see also Sec.
2.12).

3.
4.Ifsurface reflection ishigh, thelowest possible angle ofcoverage is raised from thehorizon toanangle a=k/2h, where aisinradians and histheheight oftheantenna above thesurface.
Ifsurface reflection islow, radiation striking the surface islost.
Itisclearly desirable tominimize this loss bybeam-shaping.
Over anangular region inelevation where reflected intensity equals direct intensity, R~,,atthe center ofaninterference lobe isdoubled, but midway between two lobes R~.X =O.
Atlong wavelengths (one meter orgreater), the use ofreflected radiation reduces requirements onantenna size, but the nulls 604 5.EXAMPLES OFRADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.15.9 between lobes and especially thenull region below thelowest lobe aresufficiently broad tohandicap detection and tracking greatly.
Shaping ofaradar beam toreduce toasatisfactorily low value the percentage ofenergy striking the surface becomes impractical at wavelengths about 25cm.
Atshort wavelengths (10 cmorbelow), the angular separation between lobes issmall.
Loss oftracking due tonulls will normally occur only over short track distances and will notbeasserious asit isforlong wavelengths.
For asystem that works atleast partially over land itisadvisable, however, tominimize the radiation striking thesurface bybeam-shaping, inorder toreduce thewaste inenergy.
Antenna height required forsatisfactory beam-shaping isnot excessive.
Inthe region of25cm, assessment ofthe influence ofthese effects onthegeneral performance oftheequipment becomes difficult, but fora high-performance set ofgeneral application the above considerations indicate that the best coverage obtainable asafunction ofelevation angle continues toimprove with decreasing wavelength down towave- lengths even below 10cm.
15.9.
Choice ofWavelength.-In the discussion ofother parameters, the consideration ofwavelength was necessarily included; the many factors influencing choice ofwavelength will now besummarized.
Component development has been concentrated onparticular wave- length bands.
Development ofanew wavelength region issocostly in technical effort and time that the wavelength chosen foranew system must ordinarily lieinaregion already exploited.
Ofthe wavelength regions inuse, development Linone may befurther advanced than in another, orinherent capabilities inone may bebetter than inanother.
These considerations will influence thechoice ofwavelength.
Excluding the state ofcomponent development, the most important factors that influence choice ofwavelength aresummarized below.
1.Beam characteristics inelevation angle.
From previous dis- cussions itwas concluded that thebest obtainable beam character- istics inelevation angle improve with decreasing wavelength.
At wavelengths greater than about 25cm, beam-shaping toeliminate the undesirable effects ofradiation striking the earth’s surface is nolonger feasible.
2.Coverage.
Ifcharacteristics other than antenna height areheld constant, then maximum detection range decreases slowly as wavelength decreases, but the antenna height required for the maintenance ofagiven elevation coverage varies directly with wavelength. SEC.
15.9] CHOICE OF WAVELENGTH 605 3.Beamwidth.
Regardless ofwavelength choice, the maximum antenna width foratransportable air-surveillance setappears to beabout 35ft.
The minimum width, asdetermined bycoverage requirements, isprobably about 25ft.
Abeamwidth of1°orless isdesirable ifMTI requirements areignored, and themost desirable wavelength would then appear tobeinthe 10-cm region oreven shorter.
Provision for MTI requires that the azimuth beam- width be1“ormore, and 10cmthen becomes about theminimum wavelength.
4.Atmospheric effects.
Atmospheric absorption and variations in refraction can beneglected over the wavelength region under consideration, but the scattering ofradiation from water droplets giving rise toechoes from storw centers isaneffect ofconsider- able importance (Sea.
3“10).
The scattering cross section ofthe droplets responsible forthe signal return varies asl/k4.
Return from alarge storm center also varies linearly with pulse length and with beamwidth, but these parameters are restricted to relatively narrow regions and the variation ofcross section with wavelength istherefore the controlling relation.
Dependable operational data arerather limited butthefollowing results appear tobeestablished: (a),Atawavelength of3cm, cloud return in some regions frequently obscures alarge fraction ofthe coverage area and seriously restricts the use ofthe equipment; (b)reports ofthis difficulty at10cmareless frequent, and information fur- nished onstorm centers isvaluable fordirection ofplanes around dangerous regions; (c)aswavelength isincreased, less ofthecover- age area isobscured bycloud return; but storm areas that are dangerous toplanes may fail toshow onthe radar atthe longer wavelengths.
The wavelength region between 8cmand 25cmappears tobebest on thebasis ofallthese considerations.
Though anoptimum wavelength cannot safely bespecified, wecan make three general remarks con- cerning thebest wavelength foralong-range ground-based system forair surveillance and control: 1.The choice ofthe 10-cm region for the setdescribed here was excellent, although awavelength asshort as8cmmight have been more desirable.
2.IfMTI istoplay animportant role infuture system performance, and ifimprovement inMTI performance with increasing beam- width issufficiently great, longer wavelengths may bedesirable.
The best wavelength may then become asgreat as15cmoreven 20cm. 606 EXAMPLES OF RADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.

Somewhat higher transmitter power will beavailable atthelonger wavelengths.

The Antenna.—The antenna represented adeparture from the usual paraboloid ofrevolution which had been used for earlier microwave antennas.
Itisdescribed and illustrated inSec.
9.12.
Inthefinal design oftheantenna mount, thereflectors fortheupper and lower beams are mounted back-to-back, sothat their axes differ by180°.
This complicates somewhat the mechanism fortransmission ofazimuth-angle data from theantenna mount totheindicators.
lVhen agiven indicator isswitched from upper-beam data tolower-beam data, the mechanism controlling angular orientation ofthe sweep must be suddenly shifted through alarge angle.
Operationally, onthe other hand, this arrangement was aconsiderable convenience.
Agiven air- craft could frequently beseen ineither beam, an”d byswitching beams every half-revolution ofthe antenna the operator could double the rate atwhich hereceived plots.
Lfore recent advances inantenna development have introduced antenna types, other than the parabolic cylinder fedbyalinear array, which give thebeam characteristics required forlong-range surveillance and control.
The method that now appears most promising uses a section ofaparaboloid ofrevolution forthe reflector.
The periphery ofthis surface iscuttogive anaperture several times greater inwidth than inheight, and thereflector isfedbyseveral horns ordipoles arranged along avertical line passing through thefocus.
The latter antenna system’ has the following advantages over the linear array: 1Similm antennas aredescribed inChap, 14,Vol.

3.Azimuth angle ofbeams does not shift with achange inwave- length.
Multiple beams from separate transmitter-receiver systems can be accurately settothe same azimuth angle.
This property isvery desirable ifthe system istobeequipped for work with radar beacons.
Open mesh oragrid structure can beused forthereflector surface toreduce wind resistance.
The linear-array system requires a solid surface forthe reflector, since the comparatively high gain ofthe linear-array feed will give anobjectionable back lobe through mesh orgridwork.
The ilfodulator.-Because ofits simplicity and power-handling capacity, ana-cresonance-charging line-type modulator using arotary FIG.

gap asaswitching device was chosen.
The rotary gap ismounted directly ontheshaft ofa400-cps alternator, which excites the network and isproperly phased bymechanical adjustment (Fig.
15.6).
This modulator choice was important infixing the value ofthe PRF, but, asalready remarked, the desirable value lies inthe neighborhood of 400ppsinany event.
Separate transmitters are used onthe upper-beam and the lower- beam systems; both are driven, through pulse transformers, from a single modulator.
The modulator israted at3000 kw.
R-jComponents.—The high pulse powers used inthis system demand theuseofwaveguide forthe r-fsystem.
Each magnetron operates ina field of2S00 gauss at28kvpulse voltage, dra\ving acurrent ofabout 30 amp and putting 750 k\vofr-fpower into theline atabout 65percent efficiency.
Crystal protection atthis high power level isdifficult, and ascheme of“repulsing” theTR tube isused.
Part ofthe8-kv modulator pulse 608 EXAMPLES OFRADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.1510 delivered tothe pulse transformer input iscapacitively coupled tothe keep-alive connection ofthe TR tube.
The delay inthe pulse trans- former and magnetron issuch that this pulse arrives atthe TR tube slightly before ther-fpulse arrives.
This ensures that theTR tube will fire, improving thecrystal protection.

Modifications and Additions.-The performance ofthe radar asfinally built was excellent.
Some ofthe PPI photographs inthis book, such asFigs.
6.5and 17”21, show the long range, good definition, and relative freedom from ground clutter which characterize theset.
Bythetime thesetwas built and ready foruse, theneed foritinits originally planned role asalong-range air-warning sethad nearly dis- appeared.
The usefulness ofsuch aset incontrolling offensive air operations was just beginning toberealized (Sec.
7“6).
According y theradar, which had originally been intended forairwarning from afixed site, was provided with facilities, sketched inSec.
7.6, which made it suitable asamobile radar control center foruseinoffensive airwarfare.
Apart from theaddition ofagreater number ofindicators than would have been needed forsimple airwarning, and the provision ofoff-center PPI’s forthe use ofcontrollers, the modifications made inthe setitself tofititforitscontrol function were notextensive orimportant.
Another change inthe set, also dictated byoperational experience, didresult in altering itsubstantially.
This will now bedescribed.
Modi$cation jorBeacon Use.—The usefulness ofground radar for aircraft control can begreatly extended bymodifications that permit it towork with airborne beacons (Chap.
8)mounted inthe aircraft tobe controlled.
Three principal advantages areoffered bysuch astep: 1.Range extension.
The useful range against single small aircraft ofthesetdescribed here isabout 90miles; this can beincreased by the use ofbeacons tothe limit ofthe radar horizon (about 200 miles foranaircraft at25,000 ft). 610 2.

15.11 Positive identification.
Aircraft control isfrequently complicated bythelarge number ofaircraft operating atthesame time within range ofasingle radar set.
Departure ofaircraft from planned fllght schedules makes reliance onmovements information unsatis- factory foridentification.
Abeacon can afford positive identifi- cation oftheaircraft carrying it.
Freedom from ground clutter.
Byhaving the beacon reply ata frequency different from that used bytheradar forinterrogation, the beacon replies can bedisplayed without any confusing radar echoes.

15.S.—Beacon receiving antenna mounted above lower-beam radar antenna.
Airborne beacons have been provided, almost without exception, with vertically polarized antennas.
They will thus work with thelower beam ofthesetjust described, but notwith theupper beam since thelatter is horizontally polarized.
The beacon isarranged tobetriggered bythe pulses from theradar, but itreplies onadifferent frequency, toreceive which anentirely separate beacon receiving antenna and receiver system areprovided.
The beacon antenna, mounted ontop ofthelower-beam radar antenna, isshown inFig.

DESIGN OFALIGHTWEIGHT AIRBORNE RADAR FOR NAVIGATION The next example ofradar system design tobedescribed could scarcely bemore different.
Inthedesign oftheground radar setdescribed, every- thing was subordinated toattaining the best possible performance; intheAX/APS-10, thesetnow tobedescribed, performance was impor- tant, asalways, but ithad tobeattained within avariety ofstrict limitations.
These limitations dealt with total weight, size, and po~ver consumption, and with the required simplicity ofoperation, main- tenance, and repair.
With its communicant ions and height-finding facilities, thetotal weight ofaninstallation oftheground radar comes to 66tons; theAN/APS-10 ismade upofafew simple units whose total weight isscarcely 120pounds.
15.12.
Design Objectives and Limitations.-By theyear 1943, itwas clear that airborne radar could offer anextremely important air-naviga- tional facility.
Long-wave airborne radar then inuse for sea search (Sec.
6.13) could beused fornavigation inthevicinity ofcoastlines, but interpretation ofitstype Ldisplay required long training even under the best circumstances, and was impossible over land, where themultiplicity ofecho signals was hopelessly confusing.
Microwave airborne radar with PPI display was just coming into large-scale use, and itwas clear that thepicture ofthe ground afforded bysuch equipment would beauseful navigational aid over any sort ofterrain except the open sea.
Further, microwave beacons could pro- vide fixed landmarks visible and identifiable atlong range.
However, themicrowave airborne radar sets then inexistence had been designed for some specific wartime operational requirement, such assea search, aircraft interception, orblind bombing.
Inconsequence, their very considerable weight and bulk (arising from the youth ofthe microwave radar art) were not regarded asserious drawbacks.
The radar was necessary inany case toenable the aircraft carrying ittoperform its mission, and thenavigational use ofthe radar was only incidental toits main purpose.
Nevertheless, theclarity and convenience ofthemap-like presentation 612 EXAMPLES OF RADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.
15.12 ofmicrowave radar suggested that ifsuch facilities could beincorporated inaircraft whose primary mission had little todowith radar—transpo~t aircraft, for exampl~they could serve an important navigational purpose.
Since radar inthis application isavery great convenience rather than an imperative operational necessity, itmust make the minimum demands ontheaircraft interms ofweight, drag, power con- sumption, and attention required from airand ground crew.
Existing microwave radar scarcely met these requirements in1943.
For example, the AN/APQ-13, abombing radar whose manufacture was just beginning atthe end ofthat year, has aninstalled weight of 620 lbwithout itsspecial bombing facilities, and requires 100 amp of 28-volt aircraft power.
Ithas 24controls tobeadjusted, omitting those concerned with itsbombing function.
Forty-two cables arerequired to interconnect its19separate component boxes.
Itisclearly uneconomic toinstall such anequipment as,one ofseveral navigational aids inan aircraft whose primary mission isnot high-altitude bombing.
Thus, thedesign ofanew setforthis navigational usewas indicated; and itappeared that bycareful attention toevery detail such asetmight bemade simple enough, light enough, and convenient enough tocome into widespread use.
The equipment that resulted istheAN/APS-10.
Performance Requirements.—As always, the range performance ofthe radar was the principal initial requirement.
The following ranges (innautical miles) onvarious targets were taken asbeing comfortably over theminimum necessary fornavigation even ofahigh-speed airplane.
Ground painting ....................25 t030 Cities ............................30 t050 Storm clouds ...................
10t040 Mountains ..........................25 t030 5000-ton ship........
......25 Ground beacons ..............
150(ifnotlimited byhorizon) Portable ground beacons (low power).
115 (ifnotlimited byhorizon) Since rearward vision isusually asimportant inradar navigation asforward vision, itwas concluded that the setshould have afull 360° azimuth scan.
Inorder that the appearance and location ofnearby targets should notchange toomuch between scans inanairplane traveling 4to6miles/min, only afew seconds could beallowed per scanner rota- tion.
Onthe other hand, areasonable number ofpulses perbeamwidth had tobeallowed.
Requirements onthe antenna pattern were relatively simple.
The beamwidth inazimuth had tobeasnarrow aspossible, toafford good resolution oftargets ontheground.
The elevation pattern was required togive themost uniform ground coverage possible throughout thenormal flying altitudes: from 1000 to10,000 ft. SEC.
15.12] DESIGN OBJECTIVES AND LIMITATIONS 613 Limitations Imposed byAircraft Installation.—The performance requirements just mentioned can besimply stated, and itiseasy to check whether the completed radar meets them successfully.
Neither ofthese remarks applies totheextremely important setofdesign limita- tions that arise from the fact that the radar istobeused inaircraft.
The more important ofthese limitations arementioned below.
The outstanding requirement isforlow total weight.
Every part ofthedesign isinfluenced bythe necessity formaking the final weight oftheradar assmall aspossible.
Low power consumption isimportant.
Many aircraft types have relatively low electrical-generating capacity, and itismost desirable tobeable toinstall aradar meant primarily asanavigational aidwithout thenecessity ofrevising the electrical installation ofthe aircraft.
The setmust beable tooperate either from afixed-frequency 400-cps motor- alternator set, orfrom avariable-frequency engine-driven alternator, which may supply power atafrequency ashigh as2400 cps.
Aerodynamic drag produced bytheantenna housing must beaslowas possible.
This requirement puts agreat premium onassmall anantenna aspossible.
Taken inconjunction with the requirement foranarrow beam, this means that the wavelength onwhich the radar operates should beasshort asispracticable.
J3ase ofinstallation inalltypes ofaircraft isimportant.
This suggests that theradar bebuilt intheform ofseveral small components instead ofone ortwo large units, since small units afford greater flexibility in installation.
Maintenance isalso simplified bydividing theequipment into units that can bereplaced forchecking and removed forrepair.
The necessity forconnecting such units with cables adds considerably tothetotal weight oftheset, however, and thephysical fayout must be carefully planned toreduce the number ofcables and tokeep their lengths assmall aspossible.
Equipment mounted inaircraft issubject toextreme variations of pressure and temperature.
External airpressure can vary from that at sealevel tothe pressure ofless than one-quarter atmosphere found at 30,000 ft.
Atthereduced pressures ofhigh altitude, clearances required toprevent arc-over from high-voltage points arelikely tobecome exces- sive.
Further, the low temperatures ofhigh altitude arelikely tocause condensation, inther-fline, ofthewater vapor that ispresent inwarm sea-level air.
The simplest solution forthese difficulties istoseal the transmitter and the r-fline pressure-tight sothat they can bemain- tained atsea-level pressure atany altitude.
Such pressurization ofthe modulator and the r-fsystem increases theproblems ofcooling.
Tomeet operating conditions onthe ground inthetropics, the radar must operate indefinitely atanambient tem- 614 EXAMPLES OF RADAR SYSTEM DESIGN [SEC.
15.13 perature of50”C, and must withstand anhour’s operation at71”C.
At thesame time, because ofthelow temperatures athigh altitude, theset must work satisfactorily at–55”C.
Severe vibration and shock areencountered inaircraft, and some of the weight ofanairborne radar must bespent onadequate shock- isolating mountings.
Not only must therectifier-filter power supplies fortheradar circuits operate atany frequency from 400 to2400 cps; they must also tolerate poor voltage regulation and poor waveform intheprimary power supply.
The presence inthe same aircraft ofhigh-power radio transmitters, sensitive radio receivers, and ahigh-voltage ignition system makes it necessary toshield and filter theradar setadequately toprevent itfrom interfering with other equipment, and toprotect itfrom interference arising inother equipment.
Limitations Imposed byPersonnel.—A radar fornavigational use in allsorts ofaircraft must bemanufactured ingreat quantity with ease and economy, must besosimple touseand understand that only ashort period oftraining isnecessary tooperate itadequately, and must beso easy tomaintain that itcan bekept insatisfactory condition with little maintenance effort.
Whereas, inprinciple, the operators ofsuch a specialized radar asablind-bombing device could behighly trained (though, inpoint offact, few were, inthe war), the operators ofthis navigational setwere not primarily concerned withlearning tooperate itproperly.
Itsown simplicity had tobegreat enough sothat its operation was nomore difficult tomaster than that, forexample, ofthe radio compass.
15.13.
General Design ofthe AN/APS-10.—In the framework of these performance requirements and design limitations, thedesign ofthe AN/APS-10 was attempted.
The most important decision concerned thewavelength tobeused.
Attheoutset, experiments were made with a simple PPI radar based onthe 10-cm lighthouse-tube transmitter- receiver unit used inthe AX/APG-15 (Sec.
6.14), using anantenna of 20-in.
diameter.
Itwas found that therange “performance was marginal.
Worse, theresolution ofthesetwas solowthat excessive skill ininterpre- tation was needed tonavigate with thesetintheabsence ofwell-defined geographical features.
Since the larger antenna required toimprove both the range and the resolution ofthis setcould not behoused in aircraft without creating excessive drag, itseemed clear that ashorter wavelength would have tobeused forgeneral navigation.
The other bands atwhich components had been developed were around 3.2 cm and 1.25 cm.
The l-cm art was inavery early state, and equipment was still cumbersome and ofpoor performance.
For this reason, 3.2cmwas chosen.
This was afortunate choice; for SEC.
15.13] GENERAL DESIGN OF THE AN/APS-10 615 although itwas not then known, the absorption of1.25-cm radiation in water vapor issostrong astoremove almost entirely the usefulness of this wavelength fornavigational purposes.
Next, adecision had tobetaken regarding the pulse power.
High pulse power isvery costly inthe design ofradar foraircraft, both in terms oftheprimary power requirement and interms oftotal weight.
1 Acomparison with theperformance oftheAN/APQ-13 served asaguide indetermining thepulse power ofthe AN/APS-10.
The AN/APQ-13, using about 50-kw pulse power and ahigh-altitude cosecant-squared antenna ofgain 950, showed arange ofabout 45miles forgeneral ground painting and 50to100miles oncities.
Itsreceiver had asensitivity of about 5X10–13 watts forasignal equal tonoise.
The 45-mile ground-painting range oftheAN/APQ-13, ascompared with the25miles required oftheANT/APS- 10,allowed a10-db reduction oftransmitter power forthelatter, iftheantenna gain and thereceiver sensitivity were kept the same.
However, itwas felt that a30-in.
antenna was toolarge tobetolerated fortheAN/APS-10.
Experiments showed that an18-in.
cosecant-squared antenna designed foranaltitude of7000 ftwould beuseful intheusual altitude range from 1000 to10,000 ft without unduly overilluminating short-range targets atlow altitude or causing tooserious ahole inthecenter ofthepattern ataltitudes higher than 7000 ft.
This antenna proved tohave again of700; this meant that the reduction ofantenna gain would require about 3dbofthe calculated 10-db leeway between the AhT/APQ-13 and the AhT/APS-lO.
The remaining 7dbcould beand were used topermit areduction inpulse power.
The lightweight, low-voltage 2J42 magnetron (see Fig.
10.4b) was used intheAN/APS-10, giving anoutput pulse power of 10kw.
The lower voltage and lower power required bythis tube enabled thedesign ofanextremely compact and simple pulser, shown inFig.
10.47.
Since the whole ofthe 10-db differential between the two sets had been used upinthe smaller antenna and the lower pulse power ofthe AN/APS-10, itwas necessary tomake sure that the receiver sensitivity ofthelatter setdid not fall below that ofthe AN/APQ-13.
Further, special pains had tobetaken toprovide good range performance against microwave beacons.
IntheAN/APQ-13, theTR-switch tuning was not changed from search tobeacon operation, and anarrow-band ATR was used.
The loss ofbeacon signal inthe TR and ATR alone could beas much as15or20db.
Inaddition, noautomatic frequency control ofthe beacon local oscillator was provided.
Better facilities forworking with beacons were desired intheAN/APS-10.

A.
MCCONNELL INTRODUCTION 16.1.
The Role ofMoving-target Indication.—The object ofmoving- target indication (MTI) istopresent the signals received byapulse radar setinsuch away that moving targets show upwhile stationary objects give noresponse.
The most advanced method ofdoing this allows themoving targets tobepresented onaPPI.
Figure 16.1 shows two PPI photographs, one with MT1 inoperation and one without, taken onaground radar setatBedford, Mass., using awavelength of10.7 cmand aPRF of300.
The removal ofthe ground clutter isseen tobe complete.
The photographs inFig.
16.2 were taken atBoston, Mass., where, because ofscreening byaring oflow hills, clutter does notextend appreciably beyond 10miles.
Inthese photographs, taken onaset having awavelength of10.7 cmand aPRF of1650, the effectiveness of MTI inreducing storm echoes isshown.
The problem ofMTI issomewhat more difficult and the results less satisfactory when the radar setiscarried onamoving ship orairplane because theclutter tobeeliminated isitself moving relative totheradar setand theclear-cut distinction between moving and stationary targets is lost.
Inspite ofthis, itispossible toarrange MT1 sothat vehicles moving onthe ground can beseen from anairplane.
Inthe case ofa shipborne setitispossible tocompensate forthe ship’s own motion and therefore toseeother ships and aircraft inthepresence ofsea-clutter and storm echoes.
16.2.
Basic Principles ofMTI.—Two fundamental ideas areinvolved inthe solution ofthe MTI problem: first, amethod ofreception that responds differently tofixed and tomoving targets; second, anarrange- ment that takes advantage ofthis difference byselecting only themoving targets.
The method ofreception always uses the doppler effect inone form oranother.
The simplest arrangement isthat shown inFig.

Two methods ofpresenting thedoppler information have been mentioned: the aura 1method (Fig.

These indi- cators are useful only with a stationary orvery slowly rotating antenna.

This is accomplished byapplying the superheterodyne principle both tothe locking pulse and tothe signals.

The circuits ofFigs.
16.6 and 169 areentirely equivalent asfarasthe output ofthe receiver isconcerned.
The phase ofthe i-fecho signal from astationary target depends onthestarting phase ofthetransmitter, thestarting phase ofthelocal oscillator, and therange (which determines thenumber ofcycles executed bythelocal oscillator while thetransmitted pulse travels tothetarget and back).
The i-freference signal provided bythe coherent oscillator has aphase that depends onthe starting phases ofthe trnsmitter and ofthe local oscillator, and onthe range (which determines the number ofcycles executed bythe coherent oscil- lator during theecho-time).
The starting phases ofthetransmitter and thelocal oscillator cancel outwhen thei-fecho signals and thei-freference signal beat against each other, sothat the phase ofthe receiver output depends only onthe number ofcycles executed bythe local oscillator and bythe coherent oscillator.
Both ofthese oscillators aremade tobe stable; consequently the beat signal from astationary target has a steady amplitude from pulse topulse.
When the target ismoving, its range will change from pulse topulse and afluctuating output signal results from the corresponding change inthe phases traversed bythe oscillators during the echo-time. SEC.163] APRACTICAL MTI SYSTEM 633 Asimple laboratory type ofdelay line isshown inFig.

Anend cellfilled with mercury isattached totheoutside ofeach crystal bythesame method.
When an alternating voltage isapplied across one ofthecrystals (that is,between themercury intheend cell and that inthetube), thecrystal undergoes periodic changes inthickness due tothe piezoelectric effect.

Afree quartz crystal has avery high Qand therefore such anarrow bandwidth that itcannot transmit microsecond pulses.
Inthedelay line, theloading ofthecrystal bythemercury causes thecrystal tobealmost critically damped—that is,tohave aQnear unity.
Thus the band- width ofthe crystal, when itiscut, forexample, for15.Mc/see, ismany megacycles persecond.
The frequency response curve hasitsmaximum attheresonant frequency ofthecrystal and falls tozero atzero frequency.
Thus itisnotpossible totransmit video pulses directly through thedelay line without distortion.
Instead, the pulses are used tomodulate a carrier whose frequency isthat forwhich the crystal isresonant.

PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND CHOICE OFSYSTEM CONSTANTS The primary objective ofmoving-target indication is,ofcourse, to attain ahigh degree ofdiscrimination infavor oftheechoes from moving targets compared tothose from fixed ones.
Inorder that this beaccom- plished itisnecessary that echoes, orclutter, from fixed targets be eliminated orgreatly reduced and that those from moving targets be retained with optimum sensitivity compared totheresidual clutter and theinherent noise ofthereceiver.
Since therecognition ofmoving targets isbased upon changes inthe returning echo from one pulse tothe next, any changes present inthe signals from thefixed echoes will interfere with their elimination.
Such undesirable variations areoftwo sorts: (1)those inherently present inthe returning echoes, principally due tointernal motions ofthe targets themselves ortothe effects ofscanning; (2)spurious variations due to instabilities orother shortcomings oftheradar equipment.
The methods used and the constants chosen forthe setshould beselected insuch a way astominimize theeffects oftheinherent fluctuations.
The elimina- tion ofspurious variations islargely amatter ofcareful engineering design.
Another factor tobeconsidered inthechoice ofsystem parameters is that since different radial velocities produce different changes inrelative phase from pulse topulse, certain velocity intervals are much more effective than others inproducing large uncanceled signals.
Indeed, a phase change ofonecyclethat is,aradial motion ofone-half wavelength between pulses—is equivalent tonochange atall.
Thus there arecertain “blind” velocity intervals inwhich the mass motion ofthe target does not lead toadiscernible indication.
Since the velocities about which these intervals arecentered aredetermined bythe wavelength and the pulse repetition rate oftheset,itispossible, within limits, toarrange that they fallaslittle aspossible intherange ofvelocities tobeexpected forthe targets ofinterest.
The various factors dealing with clutter elimination ,and target visibility onafixed system will bediscussed indetail from both thetheo- retical and thepractical standpoint inthenext few sections.
The addi- tional factors present when thesystem ismoving will beintroduced later.

Stability Requirements.

Thus (2) Now, from Eq.
(l),weobtain, forthefractional change inbeat amplitude, which has amaximum value equal toA+.
For ahigh-performance MTI system avalue of6percent forAy/yo could betolerated since this represents the maximum residue ofclutter amplitude left after can- cellation.
The average residue will then beconsiderably less than 6per cent.
The corresponding value ofA@is0.06 radian or~ cycle.
On substituting this value inEq.

Itwill beseen later that such alow rate ofdrift cannot beobtained inalocal oscillator without some special means ofstabilization.
Inthecase ofthecoherent oscillator, ontheother hand, thefigure isreadily attainable with awell- constructed oscillator circuit. 640 MOVING TARGET INDICATION [SEC.
16.5 Sofarwehave assumed that thecoherent oscillator isexactly intune with thei-fecho signals.
Ifthis isnotso,thevideo signals arenolonger square pulses but contain anumber ofcycles ofthe beat frequency, as shown inFig.
16.17.
Inthecase ofamoving target thebeat cycles shift horizontally from pulse topulse and give afilled-in appearance onthe A-scope.
Figure 16.17b really represents coherent i-frather than coherent video signals, with the coherent oscillator acting asasecond local oscillator.
Thus aloss insignal-to-noise ratio occurs when the signals arepassed through thevideo amplifier, whose bandpass character- istic iswrong fori-fsignals.
Itisinteresting tonote that again insignal- to-noise ratio can beobtained theoretically bydetuning the coherent oscillator sufficiently and replacing ‘“’~the video amplifier byani-fampli- fier having asuitable pass band.’ However, since this scheme requires @)~-~o~n-~ much greater precision inthecancel- F1o.

Noserious loss insignal-to-noise will occur ifthere isless than one-quarter ofabeat cycle ineach pulse.
This means, forexample, that thedetuning should beless than ~Me/see inthe case ofal-~sec pulse.
Magnetron Frequency .—Thefrequency stabilit yrequired ofthemagne- tron can now beconsidered.
The effect ofachange Aj~ ktoalter the number ofbeat cycles within the “video” pulse bythe amount 7Ajn, where rkthe pulse length.
For reasons similar tothose used incon- nection with thebeating oscillators, this quantity should not exceed tin cycle from pulse topulse.
Hence wegetfortheallowed rate ofdrift, in thesame way asbefore, (ifm 1.

Weconclude that, ifitisfound necessary tohave AFC onasystem with MTI, itshould be applied tothemagnetron rather than thelocal oscillator.
Variation inmagnetron frequency from pulse topulse causes another kind ofeffect inthecase ofextended ground clutter.
Consider two clutter signals that just overlap inrange.
Ifthemagnetron frequency changes byanamount A~~, there will bearelative phase shift between the two echoes which amounts to7A~~ cycles.
This phase shift will cause the IA.G.Emslie, “MT1 L’sing ~oherent IF,” RL Group Report No, 104—8/22/45. SEC.
16.5] STABILITY REQUIREMENTS 641 echoes tobeat inamplitude intheregion ofoverlap, even when nocoher- entreference signal ispresent.
Since theexpression forthephase shift is identical with theprevious expression, Eq.
(4)also applies here.
Extra cycles will also appear inthevideo pulses ifthemagnetron fre- quency varies during the transmitted pulse.
Such variation occurs chiefly atthe beginning and end ofthe pulse.
IfAflisthe maximum departure infrequency from the value inthe central part ofthe pulse, thenumber ofbeat cycles iscertainly less than TAfl.
With the same criterion asbefore wetherefore should have (5) Foral-psec pulse this gives Aj, <~Me/see.
However, since most ofthe effect isconcentrated near theends ofthepulse, amuch larger variation isprobably permissible.
Since the frequency pattern within the pulse does notchange from pulse topulse, thequality ofthecancellation isnot affected.
Allthat isinvolved isaslight loss insignal-to-noise ratio for moving targets.
Cancellation Equipment.
—Consider next thestability requirements on thecancellation equipment.
The detectability ofasignal onthePPI can beroughly measured bythe area under thevoltage pulse.
Thus ifthe trigger and signal delay lines differ indelay time byanamount A71, there will betwo uncanceled spikes ofwidth A71foreach echo.
Inorder to cancel, forexample, to4percent, wemust therefore make A~lless than 2per cent ofthe pulse length.
The delay lines should becapable of matching each other within this tolerance foratleast anhour atatime.
Likewise the amplitudes ofthe signals inthe delayed and undelayed channels should match to4percent foranhour atatime.
Modulator.
-Pulse-to-pulse variation inthe repetition rate can pro- duce the same effect asunmatched delay lines.
Thus the modulator should firerelative tothetrigger with avariation ofnot more than 2per cent ofthepulse length, or+ ~sec inthecase ofal-psec pulse.
Finally, wehave toconsider theeffect ofvariation inpulse length.
If this should change byanamount ATfrom one pulse tothenext, there will beanuncanceled spike ofwidth A,.
Thus weshould not allow A,/r to exceed 4percent.
Variation inpulse length can also cause anindirect effect onthephase ofthecoherent oscillator when thelatter isnot intune with thei-fecho signals.
Let usassume, forexample, that the locking pulse causes the coherent oscillator toexecute forced vibrations atthe intermediate fre- quency fortheduration ofthepulse, after which itreverts toitsnatural frequency.
Then thevariation inphase ofthecoherent oscillator isgiven byA,.Af(incycles), where Ajisthe amount bywhich the coherent 642 MOVING-TARGET INDICATION [SEC.

Itshould bementioned that these figures represent almost ideal conditions, inwhich theclutter tobecanceled shows nofluctuations ofitsown.

Both theamplitude andthe velocity ofseaclut,ter canbeexpected tovary widely with weather.
Storm echoes arevariable incharacter, depending perhaps upon their internal turbulence.
Areduc- tionof storm echoes by10dbormore hasbeen frequently observed ona 10-cm MTI system at2000 pps.
Onsome occasions, however, thereduc- tion ofechoes from certain areas ofthestorm hasbeen negligible despite atangential wind velocity.
The wooded terrain isthat ofNew England insummer.
Limited evidence suggests that there islittle change with theseasons.
However, some questions ofimportance remain with regard toground clutter.
OnthePPI ofa10-cm MT1 system operating near Boston ataPRF of 300, many thousands ofuncanceled targets have been observed under conditions that make anexplanation difficult.
These targets, which might possibly bebirds, have been noticed toincrease innumber just after sunset.
When extrapolating toother wavelengths, itshould beborne inmind that the wavelength dependence ofEq.

16.6, consists ofthevector sum ofthecon- tributions ofalarge number ofscattering ele- ments.
Asthe beam sweeps over theground, new elements areilluminated and theoldones pass outofthe beam.
Thus the signal fluctu- ates inboth amplitude and phase, asshown in Fig.

For the case ofaGaussian antenna pattern, we obtain theequation To 1.66 K=T”(lo) Itisconvenient toanalyze thefluctuation into anamplitude part and aphase part.
Todothis wecanresolve thevector rinto two components, one inthedirection ofR,theother atright angles toR.The rms value ofeach ofthese components isrO/@.
Thus the rms fluctuation in amplitude isrO/@ and the rms fluctuation inphase isapproximately ro/(Rov@).
Wecantherefore write Rms pulse-to-pulse amplitude fluctuation == R, n42 1.66(11) Rms pulse-to-pulse phase fluctuation =— radians.
n~$ These equations apply tothecase ofuniformly distributed scattering elements.
Itmight appear that asudden discontinuity inthe density ofscattering elements would cause alarger fluctuation.
Toseethat this isnot sowecanconsider theintegral {f[j’(e)]z de}~~,which isproportional totherms pulse-to-pulse fluctuation TO.
Inthecase ofauniform distribu- tion ofscattering elements, thelimits ofintegration arefrom –ccto+~.
When there isadiscontinuity yatanangle O,from thecenter ofthebeam, the limits areO,tom,and theintegral will beless than before since the integrand iseverywhere positive.
16.8.
Receiver Characteristics.
-Ideally, an MT1 system would remove allclutter signals from thescope, maintaining thegreatest possi- blesensitivity formoving targets both inthe clear and inthe clutter.
Practically, this isnot always possible, because ofclutter fluctuations, the finite perfection ofcancellation, etc.
Under these circumstances, it appears desirable toadjust theresidual clutter, after cancellation, sothat itresembles receiver noise inamplitude and texture when itispresented onthe scope.
Clutter fluctuations already have anamplitude distribution like that ofnoise, whether they aredue toscanning ortotheaction ofthewind.
Thus the only problem left istoreduce therms fluctuation tothesame value everywhere.
There aretwo ways ofdoing this, thefirst depending onthenature oftheamplitude fluctuations oftheclutter, thesecond on thenature ofthephase fluctuations.
Aswehave seen, the rms fluctuation inamplitude isproportional tothe rms clutter amplitude.
Thus ifzisthe size oftheclutter atthe SEC.
16.8] RECEIVER CHARACTERISTICS 647 input ofthereceiver, thetotal increment inamplitude can bewritten as Ax=kx+N, where kzistheamplitude component oftheclutter fluctuation and Nis thecomponent ofthei-fnoise vector inthedirection ofx.
The output fluctuation Ayisgiven by Ay=$Ax, and werequire ittobeindependent oftheclutter amplitude z.
Thus we have dy= K z kx+N’ where Kisthe(constant) value ofAy.
Integrating this equation with the condition that y=Owhen z=O,wegetthefollowing expression forthe characteristic ofthei-famplifier: (12) For values ofxgiving afluctuation kxconsiderably less than noise,the characteristic islinear.
For large values ofxitislogarithmic.
A receiver with this characteristic iscalled alin-log receiver.
The output ofthelin-log i-famplifier has tobeadded tothereference signal and then detected.
Since the clutter varies inphase aswell as amplitude, itsphase variations areconverted bythedetector, when the reference signal ispresent, into amplitude variations, which unfortunately arenotindependent ofthesize oftheclutter.
Itcan beshown, however, that noserious harm results ifthereference signal level iskept somewhat smaller than themaximum amplitude ofthelinear portion ofthereceiver characteristic.
The second method ofobtaining uniform output fluctuations depends onthefact that therms phase variation oftheclutter isindependent of thesize oftheclutter.
Thus allthat is.required isalimiting i-famplifier toremove theamplitude variations, followed byaphase-sensitive detector toconvert the phase variations into uniform amplitude variations.
To obtain the maximum sensitivity yfortargets moving inthe clutter itis necessary that thephase-sensitive detector should have alinear character- istic—that is,the output amplitude variation should beproportional to the input phase variation.
This can beachieved byusing abalanced detector formixing the reference signal with the output ofthe limiting i-famplifier.
The relative advantages ofthe two types ofreceiver will now be considered.
Ifthelin-log receiver isused, itispossible todispense with 648 MOVING- TARGET lNDICA TION [SEC.
16+3 theoscillator and amplifier shown inFig.
16.11 and tosend thei-fsignal, together with thereference signal, directly through thedelay line.
The amplifier then works attheintermediate frequency used inthereceiver.
These changes make thecircuit simpler and avoid theproblems ofcarrier modulation and demodulation.
However, the loss offreedom inthe choice offrequency forthe delay line and the comparison amplifier isa disadvantage.
Also, themethod isnotsuitable for“back-of-dish” radar sets, since the i-fsignals cannot conveniently bebrought out through slip rings.
This method ofusing alin-log receiver should beused only when simplicity and compact ness areofprime import ante.
Ingeneral, such areceiver should beused inconjunction with anoscillator and amplifier (Fig.
16.11)intheusual way.
Animportant advantage ofthe limiting receiver isthat the output video signals have ai-ange ofamplitude extending from noise only upto the limit level.
This small dynamic range makes iteasy todesign the cancellation circuits.
For thelin-log receiver, thedynamic range is6to 12dbgreater under conditions ofequal performance.
For general MTI use, thelimiting type ofreceiver istobepreferred.
However, there isatype ofMTI system inwhich moving targets are detected inthe clutter bythe fluctuations which they produce inthe clutter amplitude.
The lin-log receiver must beused insuch asystem, since thelimiting receiver cannot detect amplitude changes.
Some idea ofthemagnitudes involved inthereceiver problem can be obtained from Table 16.4.
The fluctuations due tothe wind were TABLE 164.-FLUCTUATIONS DUE TOW’IND AND SCANNING h, cm 9.2 9.2PRF 500 2000Beam- width, degrees 1 3Scanning Pulses per rate, beam- rpm width 4 21 4 250Wind effect IScanning effect rms fluctuation rms fluctuation rms total echo’ rms total echo’ db dh –34 I–22 –46 –44 obtained from Table 16,2 for wooded terrain and awind velocity of 25mph.
The scanning effect was derived from theformula forextended clutter inSec.
16.7.
Itwill benoticed that thescanning effect predomi- nates inthe case ofthe low PRF and narrow beam, whereas the two effects areabout equal forthehigh PRF and wide beam.
The fluctua- tions inthefirst case areroughly 10percent, considerably greater than the fluctuations due toinstability ofthe components.
Onthe other hand, thefluctuations inthesecond case areonly about 1percent and are therefore negligible compared with system instability. SEC,,16.9] TARGET i71SIBILITY 649 Consider howalimitingr eceivershouldbe adjusted ineach ofthese cases.
Since only thephase part ofthefluctuation isselected, thefluctua- tion ofthevideo output is1/v’2 or3dbless than thetotal input fluctua- tion, Thus the figure –22dbbecomes –25dbatthe output, which means that the rms fluctuation inthe first case isabout ~ofthelimit level, Therefore, inorder toobtain aPPI with uniform background, the gain control ofthe receiver, ahead ofthe limiting stages, should be adjusted sothat rms noise isalso ~oflimit level.
“Peak” noise is then about $oflimit level.
This adjustment ofnoise relative tolimit level ismade while viewing the output ofthe limiting receiver onan A-scope.
JVhen this has been done, the video gain control isadjusted sothat thenoise and canceled residue just show onthePPI.
The MT1 photograph inFig.
16.1 shows everything incorrect adjustment sothat theresidue ofthe clutter blends with the noise.
The corresponding photograph inFig.
162 sho~vs acase ofincorrect adjustment: receiver noise istoolarge compared with the limit level.
The result isthat the residue does not show onthescope and black “holes” appear where the clutter ~vas.
L’nder these conditions there isanexcessive loss ofsensi- tivity formoving targets intheclutter.
Inthe second case (high PRF and broad beam) the predominating fluctuations will bedue tosystem instability and maybe oftheorder of5 percent (peak) ifallthe stability requirements are met.
Thus peak receiver noise should inthis case besetat5percent oflimit level.
16.9.
Target Visibility .—There aretwo problems tobediscussed in this section.
The first has todowith the visibility ofmoving targets when they areclear oftheclutter; itincludes consideration ofundesirable targets, like clouds, aswell asdesirable targets such asaircraft.
The second problem isconcerned with the visibility ofmoving targets that occur atthesame range and azimuth asground clutter.
Targets intheClear.—lYe have seen inSec.
16.2 that thevideo pulses from the 31TI receiver, inthe case ofamoving target, areamplitude- modulated atthe doppler frequency .f,i.
Thus the pulse amplitude ata given instant tisgiven by ~1=ynCOS%jd!.

Inother words, the target appears tobeatrest when ittravels adistance x/2 (oramultiple ofh/2) between pulses, Numerically, First blind speed =Xj,/89 (Aincm, speed inmph) (16) Going back toEq.

The noise amplitude inthedelayed channel iscompletely independent of that intheundelayed channel.
Wemust therefore add thenoise powers inthetwo channels, obtaining anincrease of@ innoise amplitude after cancellation.
Hence the change insignal-t~noise ratio caused bythe addition ofMT1 isrepresented by !!;~~ ‘hefact~~lsin.Tl 1~ Radialveloc,tyoftarget FIG.

Asanexample, consider asetwith A=9.2cmand~, =2000 pps.
Then from Eq.
(16) wehave v,=206mph.
For astorm cloud traveling radially at30mph, the ratio inEq.
(2o) becomes 1/2.2 or–7db,whereas Table 16.2 shows that thefluctuation due tointernal motion ofthecloud isonly –17db.
From theMTI point of ISEC.16.9] TARGET VISIBIL1 TY 651 view translational motion ismore serious than theinternal motion ofthe cloud.
Itshould benoticed that the two effects change together asthe PRF isvaried.
Aquestion ofsome interest isthefollowing: Ifatarget ofgiven size can have any radial speed with equal probability, how often will itbe detected? Let ussuppose that the target, when moving atone ofthe optimum speeds inFig.
16.21, gives asignal Ntimes aslarge asthemini- mum detectable signal.
Then the relative response atother speeds is given by Nsin(r~d!’).
The target will beseen aslong asthis quantity isgreater than unity; the probability ofthis being thecase is T 2 N={::: fle:e;f::ignd FIC.

16.6 and 16.7 that the fluctuations ofextended clutter, whether due tothewind ortoscanning, have noiselike character.

Use ofMTI may thus entail noaverage loss. 652 MOVING-TARGET INDICATION [SEC 16.9 clutter has tocompete with theclutter-noise inmuch thesame way asa target intheclear competes with ordinary receiver noise.
Figure 16.23is avector diagram foramoving target intheclutter.
The pulse-to-pulse variation rinthe resultant vector has both amplitude and phase com- ponents just like theclutter fluctuations.
The magnitude ofrcan easily beobtained from the fact that srotates with the doppler frequency jd.
Thus theangle betweens and s’is2rf,T,and accordingly r=2ssin(mf~T).
(22) This equation, which isthe same asEq.
(14), shows that blind speeds also exist fortargets intheclutter.
Ifwetake thearithmetical average ofEq.
(22) forallspeeds, weget 4s~=—.
7r(23a) If,ontheother hand, wetake themedian with respect tovelocity, which istheaverage that wetook inthecase oftargets intheclear, weget ?=~2s.
(23b) Since thetwo values of?differ byonly 10percent orabout 1db,itdoes not matter which wetake.
The value given byEq.
(23a) isalso the arithmetical average forthe case ofanoncoherent signal from asignal generator.
Measurements can therefore bemade without appreciable error byusing thesignal from asignal generator instead ofthat due toan actual target.
Amoving-target orsignal-generator pipcan beexpected tobevisible onthe PPI if?isatleast three times the rms clutter fluctuation r~.
Using Eq.
(23a),this condition can therefore bewritten as 37rs=—rO=2.4r0.4(24) That is,thesignal amplitude should be8dblarger than therms clutter fluctuation.
Itisconvenient toexpress thevisibility condition interms oftherms clutter amplitude ROinstead ofthe rms fluctuation.
Inthe case of scanning effects this leads, with thehelp ofEq.

The ratio Ro/s,which can becalled the ‘‘subclutter visibility,” gives ameasure ofthe performance ofanMT1 system.

The quantities Kland K2are constants, but Ksmay depend somewhat onAand f,.
For example, itis probably harder tostabilize the local oscillator at3cmthan at10cm.
Again, Eq.

However, weshall assume, forsimplicity, that the over-all system instability isindependent ofAand jr.

Choice ofSystem Constants.-The following aretheobjectives inthedesign ofaground radar setwith MT1: 1.Ylaxlmum sensitivity tomoving targets intheclutter.
2.Maximum sensitivity tomoving targets intheclear.
3.Maximum cancellation ofundesirable moving objects, such as clouds.
Some ofthese objectives areindirect conflict with thenormal aims of aradar set.
For example, abroad beam and slow rate ofscan will reduce scanning fluctuations and therefore help the first obfective, but will decrease resolution and hamper therate offlow ofinformation.
Because ofthis, MT1 should beintegrated into the radar setfrom the start and notadded asanafterthought.
S’ubchdter Vi.sibik@-From Eq.
(28) we see that the subclutter visibility can beincreased byincreasing nand A.f,,but that nothing much isgained bygoing greatly beyond thepoint where thescanning and wind fluctuations are equal tothose due tosystem instability.
Awell-de- signed system might have anrms instability of2percent, inwhich case, from Eq.
(24), thegreatest possible subclutter visibility is26db.
There isthen noneed tomake theindividual subclutter risibilities forscanning and wind greater than 30db.
For thecase ofscanning, that means, from Eq.
(25), that ndoes nothave tobelarger than 120pulses perbeamwidth.
Again, from Eq.
(24), therms wind fluctuation should beless than 22db.
This happens tobethe value forwooded terrain when A=3.2cmand 654 MOVING-TARGET INDICATION [SEC.

Scanning fluctuations arethe principal difficulty in MTI design.
The quantity nisproportional tobeamwidth and PRF, and inversely proportional toscanning rate.
Ithasthevalue 120foraPRF of720with a1°beam rotating at1rpm.
Although this setofconstants satisfies the condition above, the scanning rate istoo slow formany purposes.
To attain greater rate without losing subclutter visibility, either thebeam- width orPRF must beraised; thealternative istotake aloss insubclutter ~o100 Radialspeedinmph FIG,16.24,—Distribution ofrachal speeds for random aircraft, assuming all ground speeds equally likely in rarige 100 to400 mph and all direc- tions equally likely.visibility, which may bethe best solu- tion insome cases.
For example, ifthe targets arealllarger than theclutter, a subclutter visibility ofzero dbissuffi- cient.
Inthat case thescanning rate can beraised to30rpm.
Itis,therefore, of considerable importance touseallpossi- blemethods ofdecreasing thesize ofthe clutter relative tothe moving targets, such asshaping thebeam inelevation, using short pulses, and choosing thesite carefully.
BlindSpeeds.—It has already been seen that MTI causes an“average” loss ofabout 3dbwhen allradial speeds areequally probable.
1This istrue no matter where the blind speeds happen tofall.
Weareinterested, however, in targets such asairplanes and clouds which have non-uniform distributions ofradial speeds, and would like toknow the best values ofthe blind speeds inthese cases.
Figure 16.24 shows the distribution ofradial velocities forairplanes whose ground speed can have any value between 100 and 400 mph with equal probability and whose direction offlight israndom.
Itishard to choose the best blind speeds from this graph.
There will probably be anaverage loss1ofabout 3db, asinthe case ofauniform distribution, whether there are many blind speeds inthe interval Oto400 mph or whether thefirst optimum speed comes at,forexample, 400 mph.
The choice ofblind speeds isofnoparticular consequence, per se;but there may bespecial cases, such asairport traffic control, where theradial speed can beregulated.
Blind speeds can then bechosen accordingly.

Inthe case ofclouds moving at 30mph, that gives usVI=900 mph, which isasuitable value asfaras Fig.

Inthedetection ofships, whose velocities arecomparable with those of clouds, itmight bethought that theships would becanceled along with theclouds.
This isnot sobecause ships, when within thehorizon, give much larger signals than clouds, and still show upstrongly after a10-db cancellation.

Itis necessary tovary the frequency ofthe doppler oscillator automatically astheantenna scans.

16.13] BEATING DUETOFINITE.
PULSE PACKET 657 The simplest way ofemploying thenoncoherent method istousean A-scope presentation and watch forechoes that arefuzzy ontop.
This type ofecho indicates the presence ofamoving target inthe clutter attherange shown onthescope.
The scheme isuseful only when very slow scanning can betolerated.
An alternative indication can be obtained bygating offallbut ashort portion oftheA-sweep and putting theoutput through apair ofheadphones.
Amoving target within the “gate” then produces amusical note inthephones.
Amore useful arrangement istoput the video output through the usual cancellation circuits and display the moving targets onaPPI.
With such equipment inanairplane, roads will show uponthescope as intersecting lines ofdots due tothemoving vehicles.
The drawback tothenoncoherent method isthat amoving target can bedetected only when there isground clutter atthe same range and azimuth asthetarget.
Thus although themethod works well outtothe range where theclutter begins togetpatchy, beyond this range moving targets become lost inthe clear places.
Aplan for overcoming this difficulty istohave noncoherent operation forshort ranges and coherent operation forlong ranges.
This can beaccomplished bygating offthe coherent reference oscillations forthe required number ofmiles atthe start ofeach sweep.
Since thestation ismoving, itisnecessary, during the coherent part ofthe sweep, tocompensate forthis motion.
The method ofdoing this hasbeen described inthepreceding section.
16.13.
Beating Due toFinite Pulse Packet.—In addition tothe fluctuations due toscanning and wind, there isanother kind offluctuation when thesystem ismoving.
This arises from the fact that the clutter elements illuminated bythebeam atagiven instant donot, because ofthe spread ofradial velocities within the finite illuminated area, allhave thesame doppler frequency.
Signals from clutter will therefore beat with each other atfrequencies upto~1=2Au/A, where AUisthespread inradial velocity.
Letvbethevelocity ofthesystem and 0theazimuth angle.
Then the radial velocity isocosO,and thus wehave AU=–v9 sin0 forO>> 8, where eisthebeamwidt h.

When thesystem iscarried inanairplane there isaneffect due tothe depression angle aswell asthe azimuth effect just discussed, Since the beam isusually broad inavertical plane, therange ofdepression angles within the illuminated area ofclutter islimited bythe pulse ~vidth.

Objectionable modulation ofthe transmitted pulse bythe use of 60-cps power ontheheater hasbeen observed with thetype 4J47.
This is probably caused bythe magnetic field .oftheheater current.
Nosuch difficulty has been found with the2J32, owing apparently tothedesign andconstruction oftheheater.
Three methods ofavoiding this modula- tion areavailable.
Athigh PRF’s theheater current can beturned off after starting the system, since the cathode temperature will bemain- tained bybombardment.
Alternatively thePRF can bemade anexact submultiple ofthepower-line frequency.
Since neither ofthese methods can begenerally applied, itwill sometimes benecessary tooperate the magnetron heater ondirect current.
Heater hum modulation should eventually bemade amatter oftube-manufacturing specification.
The useofasupersonic delay line necessitates aconstancy ofPRF to &ofapulse width.
This isthemost severe new requirement placed by MTI upon the modulator.
Ithas been successfully met byhard-tube and byhydrogen-thyratron designs.
Intheir current state, triggered- gapmodulators were notquite adequate forMTI systems in1946.
Since little effort had been put upon thejitter problem, itseemed reasonable to expect that triggered gaps can beconsiderably improtied.
The rotary gapcanbeused forMTI only ifastorage tube serves asdelay element.

The Stable Local Oscillator.-Two types of10-cm local oscillator tubes have been investigated: the type 417 and type 2K28 reflex klystrons.
The 417 has abuilt-in cavity and istherefore more microphonics than the2K28, which hasaremountable cavity.
However, theexternal cavity gives the 2K28 alower Q,which causes larger noise fluctuations and greater sensitivity toexternal 60-cps magnetic fields.
Both tubes show frequency modulation when theheaters arerun ona-c power.
The 2K28 was chosen forincorporation into thelocal oscillator unit shown inFig.

Most frequency deviations arenotofthis simple sort.
They aremore likely tobeperiodic orrandom, with asuperimposed uni- form drift.
The rate ofchange offrequency can beexpressed bya Fourier spectrum and thetotal phase error determined bysuperimposing thecontributions resulting from each oftheFourier components.

The Coherent Oscillator.-Locking atradio frequent yhas been accomplished at10cm, but itsfeasibility forfield service isyettobe investigated.
The relative ease and dependability ofi-flocking have resulted initsuseforallcoherent microwave systems ofthepast.
This section will discuss oscillators that receive ani-flocking pulse and deliver ani-freference signal according tothearrangement ofFig.
16.9.
TheLocking Pulse.—If the phase-locking istobeconstant from one pulse tothenext with aprecision of1°,thecarrier-frequent ypacket that does thelocking must beunusually free ofrandom components.
These may arise from several sources, ofwhich themost likely isthetransmit- receive switch.
The gaseous arcdischarge intheTRtube generates noise- like oscillations.
These may reach the coherent oscillator bypassing from thesignal mixer, viathelocal oscillator, tothelocking-pulse mixer.
The available remedies arethe use ofloose mixer coupling, lossy local- oscillator cable, and separate pickup loops inthelocal-oscillator cavity.
Another cause ofrandom components inthelocking pulse isexcessive r-fpulse amplitude atthe locking mixer.
Ifthe r-fpulse exceeds the level ofthe local oscillator, self-rectification will take place, yielding a video pulse that will have noncoherent components attheintermediate frequency.
Even though aneffort hasbeen made toreduce ther-fpulse amplitude, this trouble may persist inasubtle form.
Iftheattenuator preceding thelocking mixer isofthesimple ‘‘waveguide-beyond-cutoff” variety, itmay allow harmonic frequencies, generated bythetransmitter, 1S.Roberts, “AMethod ofRating theStability ofOscillators forMTI,” RL Report No.819, Oct.

Afurther source oflocking trouble isstatistical noise.
Ifasimple cable-coupling circuit isused intheabsence ofalocking-pulse preampli- fier, care must betaken tomaintain adequate pulse amplitude.
Circuit Design.-Any conventional type offreely running oscillator canbephase-locked byinjecting into itstuned circuit asufficient ylarge carrier pulse.
There isacertain degree ofincompatibility between the requirements that the oscillator beextremely stable and yet precisely phasable.
Asimple method ofreconciling these requirements istostop theoscillator completely before each radar transmission sothat thelock- ingpulse isalso astarting pulse.
Bythis process, allprevious phase information isdestroyed and thelocking pulse isrequired tooverwhelm merely the statistical noise fluctuations present inthe oscillator tuned circuit.
The stopping ofthecoherent oscillator can beaccomplished by applying abias “gate” perhaps 100 psec before each transmitted pulse.
This gate isreleased just before, during, orjust after thelocking pulse, while theresonant circuit oftheoscillator isstill ringing.
The amplifying circuits that precede the oscillator can bemade reasonably narrow since pulse shape isunimportant.
These circuits must bebroad enough to allow forlocal-oscillator detuning and tomaintain alarge locking-pulse- to-noise ratio.
Itisadvantageous touse abias slightly beyond cutoff inalate amplifying stage inorder tosuppress any spurious low-level oscillations which, bytheir persistence, might introduce anappreciable phase error either before orafter locking.
The actual injection ofthe locking pulse into theoscillator might beaccomplished inany ofseveral ways, including the use ofanextra oscillator control grid.
The most flexible method and theonemost widely used istheconnection oftheplate ofapent ode injection-tube across all, orpart of,the LC-circuit ofthe oscillator.
The oscillator itself must bedesigned with considerable care.
The resonant circuit must have ahigh Q.
Input and output loading must be held toaminimum.
Heater hum modulation must beminimized by keeping thed-cand r-fimpedance between cathode and ground assmali aspossible.
The oscillator tube must beofanonmicrophonic type.
The circuit asawhole must berigidly constructed and shock-mounted, Power-supply ripple must not exceed afew millivolts.
When these precautions areobserved, free-running stabilities ofaround 1kc/sec2 can beobtained at30Me/see.

Begin- ning attheend cellonthenearest top corner, thesignal passes down thenearest tube, isreflected twice, passes upthetube next left, etc., until after sixreflections itenters the cell atthe extreme right.
The trigger line ishalf aslong, giving rise toadouble-frequency trigger which is divided electrically.
This type ofline isrelatively easy tomake.
The two end surfaces of the main assembly are ground flat and parallel after welding.
The tolerance inparallelism iseased forthe critical signal line bythe auto- collimating effect ofthethree reflector blocks.
Freedom from warping is insured bythe use ofhot-rolled steel and byannealing.

Ifsuch abeam isincident upon awall ofthemercury container, itcan bespecularly reflected without appreci- able loss, providing theangle ofincidence issufficiently large.
Labora- tory delay lines have been constructed consisting ofamercury-filled tray within which asupersonic beam isrepeatedly reflected from the side walls inany ofavariety ofgeometrical patterns until thebeam reaches the receiving quartz.
Designs that have been proposed inthe past have appeared inferior tothe folded line asregards weight, size, orease of construction, and have consequently notbeen pursued totheengineering stage.
Z’heFusedQuartzLine .—Solid media offer difficulties notencountered inliquids.
The uncontrolled transfer ofenergy between compressional and transverse modes will give rise topulse distortion and multiple echoes.
Such difficulties may occur attheboundaries ofthematerial or atpoints ofinhomogeneity.
Since sound velocity insolids isgreater than that inmercury byafactor ofabout 4,thebeam spread isgreater and the delay path longer.
However, a420-~sec line giving acceptable perform- ance hasbeen made ofanannealed fused quartz block 6by17by1Scm.
This lineoperated at15Me/see with apulse length oflessthan 1psec.
.kn internal reflection pattern was employed which resembled thepattern of theliquid delay tank, butusewas made ofthespecific elastic properties of fused quartz toachieve acontrolled transfer ofenergy between compres- sional and transverse modes.
The result was that the energy inthe transverse mode could bereduced tozero after each group ofthree reflections.
Although much engineering remains tobedone, itispossible that delay times can beextended to1000 or‘.2000 psec bythe use of larger blocks.

The two quantities tobechosen, along with theline configuration and the end-cell type, arethe carrier frequency and tube diameter.
These enter into thedesign mainly inconnection with attenuation, bandwidth, and demodulation,.
The over-all delay-line attenuation can bedivided into two parts: that which occurs inthemedium itself, and that which has todowith the efficiency ofthe quartz crystals inconverting electrical energy into acoustic energy.
Both carrier frequency and tube diameter affect theattenuation that occurs within the delay medium.
The free-space frictional attenuation inliquids isproportional tothesquare ofthefrequency.
Inmercury this attenuation isabout 0.11 db/in.

The equation applies tothe case ofreflecting end cells.
Now R1and Rz depend onthe bandwidth that isrequired, since the bandwidth ateach crystal isinversely proportional tothe product oftheloading resistance and thetotal capacity, including theelectrostatic capacity ofthecrystal and the stray capacity ofcable connections.
This assumes that single- tuned coupling circuits areused.
The characteristic impedance R~isinversely proportional tothe active area ofthe crystal and tothe square ofthe frequency.
At10 Me/see the value is22,000 ohms foranactive area of1in.2 With this area thetotal capacity ateach crystal isabout 50ppj, and thebandwidth isthen 3.8Me/see perend ifRI=Rz=300ohms.
These values give atransfer impedance of8.6ohms.
Itwill benoticed that noaccount is taken ofthe inherent bandwidth ofthe crystals.
This isbecause the bandwidth for both crystals inseries ismore than ~ofthe carrier frequency.
Itcan beshown that, foragiven bandwidth, the transfer impedance isamaximum when the crystal diameter ischosen sothat the active crystal capacity equals thetotal stray capacity.
The carrier frequency for mercury lines may range from 5to30 Me/see, with the most usual values inthe range from 10to20Me/see.
Choice offrequency depends upon the’ delay-line attenuation, and on thefact that thenumber ofcarrier cycles perpulse must besufficient to allow accurate demodulation.
Itwas mentioned earlier that the quartz-mercury combination has adequate inherent bandwidth.
Inareflecting end cell the response is actually flat over afrequency range equal to40per cent ofthe carrier frequency.
This allows asimple cure forapractical difficulty that is frequently encountered with this type ofcell.
Because thereflecting end cellisloaded ononeside only, aslight smudge orspot ofscum will unload aportion ofthe crystal area without removing the electrical excitation.
When this happens, the pass band exhibits sharp spikes atthe resonant frequency ofthequartz.
These seriously impair the quality ofcancella- 672 MOVING TARGET INDICATION [SEC.16.19 tion.
This difficulty can beavoided byoperating atacarrier frequency that isfaroffcrystal resonance but still onthe flat part ofthe loaded characteristic.

Delay-line Signal Circuits.-The delay line isalow-impedance device with alarge attenuation; itismechanically awkward tomount the line physically close tovacuum-tube circuits.
These facts combine to make thedelay process electrical yexpensive.
The subject ofdelay-line signal circuits has been treated atlength inanother book.
1Itwill be reviewed here.
fine-driving Circuits.-The requirement that the signal output shall bewell above thestatistical noise level generally means that considerable power must befurnished tothetransmitting crystal.
Ifani-fsignal from the receiver istodrive the line, amplification is required.
Otherwise, acarrier frequency must bemodulated with a video signal.
This problem issimilar tothat ofthetelevision transmitter.
Only areasonable degree oflinearity isrequired; theresponse slope should not vary bymore than perhaps 15per cent.
The real difficulty arises from the proximity ofthe carrier and video frequencies and from the requirement that the delayed and undelayed video signals must cancel to1per cent inamplitude.
Insimple modulators, modulation components are removed from the modulated carrier channel by frequency discrimination.
Ifthe modulation spectrum extends tomore than half the carrier frequency, spurious transients inthe carrier pass band may arise intwo ways.
The modulation spectrum may have components that lieinthe carrier- channel pass band, ormodulation components may add tocarrier side- band components togive components lying within the carrier-channel pass band.
Further, spurious components may arise from frequency modulation ofthe carrier oscillator bythe video signal.
Since the carrier phase israndom from pulse topulse, theenvelope ofthe summa- tion ofallsuch components within the carrier pass band will vary from pulse topulse sothat cancellation will beimperfect.
These difficulties can beavoided bythe balanced modulation ofacarrier amplifier driven byanisolated oscillator.
Acommon procedure istouse parallel-grid modulation ofapush-pull amplifier stage.
Alternatively, the problem might besolved byphase-locking thecarrier oscillator tothetransmitted pulse trigger, thereby insuring aconstant relative phase between each echo and the carrier.
Oscillator isolation would still benecessary, since otherwise astrong moving target might destroy the phase coherence.
The Two-channel Amplifier.-The signal level atthe input terminals ofthetwo-channel amplifier must begreat enough sothat the statistical noise generated therein isconsiderably smaller than the statistical noise 1vol.20. SEC.

Maxi- mum signal-t~noise ratio isobtained with ashort lead from thedelay line tothefirst amplifier grid.
Iftheamplifier cannot belocated within afew inches ofthe delay line, apreamplifier isnecessary.
Low-noise input circuits can profitably beused, but critically adjusted circuits should be avoided, ifpossible, because ofthe difficulty ofmaintaining balance between thedelayed and undelayed channels.
The bandwidth ofthe amplifier must besufficient toavoid serious impairment ofsystem resolution and the loss ofsystem signal-to-noise.
1 Inaddition, thebandwidth ofthedelayed and undelayed channels must besufficient tomake the interchannel balance noncritical.
Bandpass unbalance will have relatively little influence upon pulse shape ifthe bandwidth ofeach split channel isperhaps twice that ofthe over-all system.
Even though the bandwidth ofthese channels islarge, itmay still benecessary tomake anapproximate compensation fortwo types of unbalance.
The smaller gain intheundelayed channel would ordinarily result inagreater bandwidth.
This channel should therefore benar- rowed tomatch the other bythe addition ofcapacity toground inthe low-level stages.
The second type ofunbalance arises from thefrequency dependence ofattenuation -inthe delay-line medium.
The square-law factor generally predominates.
Compensation canbeobtained byinsert- inginthedelayed channel anLC-circuit tuned toafrequency much higher than the carrier frequency.
Amplitude cancellation to1percent implies anextraordinary degree oflinearity inthetwo channels.
The carrier level atthecanceling diodes must bewell above theregion ofsquare-law diode response.
The final i-f stages must beconservatively operated.
Afirst-order correction for residual nonlinearity will result ifthe last two i-fstages ofthe two channels areidentical inevery respect.
Gain adjustments should bemade inlow-level stages toavoid the introduction ofnonlinearity.
Awider range ofadjustment will be required inthedelayed channel because ofpossible variations indelay-line attenuation.
Afirst-order balance oftransconductance changes due to heater voltage fluctuations will result ifthe same number ofamplifying tubes isused ineach channel.
Pentodes with high mutual conductance frequently exhibit small sudden changes ingain asaresult ofeither heat- ingorvibration.
The gains oftheindividual channels can bestabilized through feedback ofbias derived bydetection ofthe carrier level.

The most difficult ofthese operations isamplification.
If statistical noise and weak moving-target signals are tobefully visible, they must reach thefinal video rectifier atalevel sufficient tocause linear operation ofthat detector.
Since the noise level atthe cancellation detector may beasmuch as40dbbeneath the signal peak, again of several hundred may berequired between cancellation and rectification.
This video amplification isdifficult because ofthe bipolarity and wide dynamic range ofthe signals.
Unless special precautions are taken, strong signals from moving targets may draw grid current and bias the amplifier tothepoint where weaker moving-target signals arelost.
The bipolar nature ofthe signals prevents the application ofthe clamping technique, which isuseful inavoiding asimilar trouble with unipolar video amplifiers.
Blind spots and overshoots can beadequately mini- mized bycareful choice oftime constants, grid bias, and plate load resistors, although several additional amplifier tubes may beneeded asa result .1 Full-wave rectification before application toaunipolar device such asaPPI isroughly equivalent todoubling thePRF~and iscorrespondingly toberecommended.

Delay-line Trigger Circuits.-For proper cancellation the PRF oftheradar transmitter must match thesupersonic delay to~ofa pulse length.
Free-running oscillators forgenerating the trigger have been built tofirethetransmitter atasuitably constant rate.
Because of thelarge thermal coefficient ofdelay inmercury, normal fluctuations in ambient temperature necessitate manual readjust ment ofsuch oscillators atintervals ranging from 10min to1hr.
Since this amount ofattention cannot betolerated inmost applications, several methods have been devised for automatically maintaining time synchronism between the PRF and the supersonic delay.
Time synchronism ismaintained bygenerating trigger pulses ata PRF determined either bythesignal delay line orbyanauxiliary delay line.
The methods for doing this can bedivided into two classes regenerative and degenerative.
The regenerative method has already been described briefly inSec.
16.3.
The Degenerative Trigger Circuit.—A highly stable oscillator generates thetransmitter trigger, and acorrection isapplied tothe oscillator ifit fails tomatch the delay line.
This correction isobtained asfollows, Several microseconds before thetransmitted pulse, theecho input tothe 1Nonblocking amplifier design isdiscussed inSees.

This trigger does three other things: itgenerates asample video pulse which travels down theline; itoperates acoincidence circuit which examines thetime ofarrival from thecomparison amplifier ofthe preceding sample pulse; and finally after suitable delay itfires the transmitter and resensitize the echo circuits.
The coincidence circuit supplies avariable d-cbias totheoscillator which keeps thefrequency of that oscillator instep with thesupersonic delay time asmeasured bythe sample pulses.
This arrangement hasthedisadvantage that ittakes anumber oftubes and, like allmultistage feedback circuits, isdifficult toanalyze incase of trouble.
Ithas theadvantage that, with small additional elaborations, thesample pulse residue after cancellation canbeused tocontrol thegain ofone channel ofthecomparison amplifier.
This type ofAGC corrects forchanges inboth theamplifier and thedelay line.
Regenerative Trigger Circuits.
—Three distinct methods have been proposed fortrigger regeneration.
They differ inthe way inwhich the fraction ofamicrosecond inevitably lost inthetrigger amplifier ismade up inthedelayed signal channel.
The compensating delay must beinserted after thepoint atwhich thetrigger pulse hasleftthat channel but before cancellation.
The first method istoadd the required delay either atcarrier or video frequency.
Unfortunately, noelectrical delay lines areavailable which arecapable ofreproducing amicrosecond pulse with lessthan 1per cent distortion.
The second method involves theuseofanauxiliary delay-line receiv- ingcrystal slightly closer tothetransmitting crystal than isthe regular receiving crystal.
The auxiliary crystal receives thetrigger pulse.
The finaf time adjustment can beaccomplished inthe trigger circuit either mechanically byanactual shift ofthecrystal orelectrically bytheuseof ashort variable delay.
The disadvantages ofthis method lieinthe excessive attenuation inthe trigger channel, the increased difficulty of delay-line construction, and the loss ofdesign flexibility due tothe necessity ofmixing thetrigger and thevideo signals atthetransmitting end ofthe delay line while preventing their interaction atthe receiving end.

Operating Tests.—The minimum additional equipment required tocheck the components peculiar toan MTI system can beincorporated inasingle A-scope chassis.
This chassis should include video amplifiers, expanded and delayed sweeps, and avacuum-tube voltmeter, together with switches and permanent connections toother parts ofthe system.
Inaddition, the receiver chassis s’hould include thelocking-test channel shown inFig.
16.30, and thetwo-channel amplifier may contain adelay-line attenuator.
Bymeans ofarectifying crystal permanently connected tothe r-f transmission line, together with anexpanded and suitably phased sweep, the transmitted pulse envelope can beinspected for hum modulation and mode jumping.
This test can beused whenever the more general coherent oscillator locking test shows trouble.
The locking-pulse mixer current should bemonitored.
This can be done byswitching themeter normally used forthesignal-mixer current.
Ascan beseen from Fig.
1630, the locking-test channel delays a sample ofthelocking pulse bymeans ofashort auxiliary supersonic delay line, and then mixes this sample with the received signal.
Ifreflecting end cells areused, multiple reflections within thedelay line will give rise toanumber ofequally spaced locking pulse echoes.
These echoes will beat with thereference signal.
The presence ofcycles within theechoes, when viewed onanexpanded A-scope, will show when thelocal oscillator isout oftune.
Since the coherent oscillator isunlikely todrift, the tuning ofthelocal oscillator togive maximum receiver response needs to bechecked only rarely.
The principal function ofthelocking-test channel, asitsname implies, istoreveal any unsteadiness intheoriginal locking pulse orany failure of thecoherent oscillator tolock properly.
Anattenuator and appropriate switches can bebuilt into the input circuits ofthetwo-channel amplifier topermit measurement ofdelay-line attenuation.
Checking and adjustment ofcancellation can bedone while theradar isoperating bymixing adelayed video pulse with the signals before cancellation.
The delay can bechosen tobring thetest pulse toarange position near the outer edge ofthe PPI, and adjustments can then be made forthebest cancellation ofthevideo pulse.
Because ofthe several gain controls inseries inthe receiving train, ad-cvacuum-tube voltmeter isnecessary tocheck the carrier level at thecancellation detectors.

In the useoftheinformation much depends upon the location oftheindi- cators.
“Radar relay” isameans forseparating these two components sothat each can occupy themost favorable site orsothat indicators can beoperated atseveral places simultaneously.
Asthe name implies, theradar data aretransmitted from thesource atwhich they arecollected tosome remote point bymeans ofaradiation link.
17.1.
The Uses ofRadar Relay .-Control ofaircraft ineither military orcivilian applications requires the review and filtering ofamass of information gathered from many sources, ofwhich radar isonly one.
Control centers are, therefore, located atsites chosen fortheir operational convenience, whereas radar locations arechosen mainly forterrain and coverage reasons.
Sometimes itisdesirable tocollect the data atgreat distances from one ormore fixed land stations.
Advantages are also gained byobtaining thedata atanairborne sitewith itsextended horizon, but displaying and using the data onthe ground oronaship.
Onthe other hand, occasions arise inwhich anaircraft can usefully employ information collected from another site.
Inany ofthese cases, the possibility ofmultiple dissemination ofthe data tomany points offers attractive possibilities.
Prior tothe advent ofradar relay such transmission was done by voice ornot atall.
Since the average operator can pass ononly about five data perminute this method isfartooslow forany rapidly changing complex situation, inaddition tobeing rather inaccurate.
Any really sophisticated use ofradar data atremote points therefore demands the useofsome sort ofrelay technique.
Two general types ofsituation arise: (1)those inwhich thedata are transmitted between jixedpointsonland, inwhich case itispossible to usefixed, narrow-beam antennas atboth ends oftherelay link (or, ifthe information istobebroadcast from asingle antenna, touse directive antennas atleast onthevarious receivers); and (2)those inwhich oneor both sites aremoving, inwhich case the antennas must beeither omni- 680 SEC.

The first situation isbyfarthe simpler from the technical standpoint since large antenna gains can be used inavery simple manner.
17.2.
The Elements ofRadar Relay .—One obvious method ofrelaying radar information istotelevise anindicator screen attheradar siteand to transmit the information byexisting television means.
This system leads toaloss both insignal-to-noise ratio and inresolution because persistent displays do not televise well.
Furthermore, any single televised display would have tobeaPPI presenting themaximum radar ‘==-7I IReceiver 1’1VideoSynchronizer signals Triggerpulse RadarstattonY P~&t3n Scandata Receiver - transmitter IVideosignals* I b DisplaystationTriggerpulse F1m 17.1.—Elements ofasimple radar relay system.

range, with theresult that much inherent resolution isimmediately lost even though expanded displays might beused atthereceiving end.
The first, butnotthesecond, ofthese difficulties might beovercome bystoring theinformation onanOrthicon orother storage device rather than ona cathode-ray tube.
Afarsuperior method istotransmit theoriginal radar data insuch a way that any desired displays can beproduced atthereceiving location in exactly thesame way ascan bedone attheradar itself.
Todothis, itis necessary toprovide atthe receiving station: radar video signals, the modulator trigger (orthe pulse itself ),and amechanical motion (orits electrical equivalent) that faithfully reproduces themotion ofthescanner.
The elements ofasystem for transmitting this information are indicated inFig.
17.1.
The radar data are delivered from the settoa “synchronizer” which.
arranges them inproper form tomodulate the 682 RADAR RELAY [SEC.
172 transmitter.
Atthereceiving station, thereceiver amplifies and demodu- lates theincoming signals and delivers theresults toan“analyzer.” The latter performs thenecessary sorting into video signals, trigger pulse, and scanner data.
The video and trigger are delivered immediately tothe indicator system.
The scanner data must usually bemodified inform before being passed oneither totheindicators fordirect useinelectrical display synthesis, ortothe “scan converter.” The scan converter uses these data toconstruct aduplicate ofthe scanner motion that can be used todrive aposition-data transmitter associated with theindicators.
Since the requirements ofthe actual transmission and reception are very similar tothose oftelevision, slightly modified television transmitters and receivers can beused.
Together with the antennas, etc., they will bereferred toasthe“radio-frequency” (r-f) equipment.
The remaining components will becalled the “terminal” equipment.
Except, perhaps, when microwave frequencies areused inthe radio link, theultimate limit ofsensitivity isusually setbythedegree ofoutside interference rather than bythe inherent signal-to-noise ratio ofthe receiver.
Many factors must beconsidered intrying tominimize the effects ofthis interference.
1.The strength ofthe desired signals atthe receiver input terminals should bemade ashigh asfeasible compared with that ofthe interference.
This ischiefly amatter ofmaking proper choice of frequency, transmitter power, and antenna characteristics.
2.The data signals should, asfaraspossible, bemade unlike the expected interference insignal characteristics, and every advantage should betaken ofthese differences inthe receiving equipment.
3.Incertain cases afavorable signal-to-interference ratio can be enhanced bytechniques such asthe use ofwide deviation ratios with frequency modulation.
METHODS OFSCANNER-DATA TRANSMISSION Ineven thesimplest situation, therelay link must transmit theradar video signals, the trigger pulse, signals descriptive ofthe scanning, and sometimes range and angle markers.
1Inmore complex cases some orall ofthese items may beduplicated, and additional data such asbeacon or Identification ofFriend orFoe, IFF, signals maybe involved.
One ofthe major problems ofradar relay istofind economical methods ofcarrying allthis information atone time.
Inthe next few sections itwill be assumed that asingle transmitter istorelay one setofdata ofeach 1Rangemarkers need betransmitted only ifsome error isunavoidably present in thetiming ofthemodulator trigger pulse.

Complications introduced bymultiple sets will bedescribed later.
17.3.
General Methods ofScanner-data Transmission.-Simultane- ous transmission ofvideo signals and range and angle markers isrela- tively simple.
Marker signals need only bemixed with the video signals; noseparation isperformed atthe receiver.
Trigger pulses can also bemixed with thevideo since there isnoconflict intime, but some method ofseparating them atthe receiving station must beprovided.
Ifthe pulses are transmitted atahigher power level than the video signals, the difference involtage amplitude can beused asacriterion.
This high-level transmission ofpulses isusually done with amplitude- modulated r-fequipment, since thebrevity ofthepulses allows high pulse powers, with attendant signal-to-interference gain, tobeobtained cheaply (Sees.
17”11, 17.12), but itisnot feasible with frequency-modulated equipment.
The alternative istoseparate thesignals intime, thevideo signals being excluded from the transmitter during aninterval prior to and including the pulse.
The trigger channel atthe receiving station is blocked byanelectronic switch except when the pulse isexpected.
.Means for accomplishing both ofthese separation methods will be described later.
Relaying the scanner data ismuch more complex.
Itisnot feasible totransmit thenumerical value ofanangle byaproportional amplitude or frequency modulation ofanr-fcarrier.
Itispossible todevise methods whereby certain functions (e.g.,thesine and cosine) ofthescan angle can beused tomodulate two ormore subcarriers’ directly bymeans ofslowly varying voltages; this has been done inthe laboratory.
Ithas been found farmore effective toconvey theinformation through themedium ofperiodic signals whose frequencies orrepetition rates areseveral times those involved inthescanning and whose characteristics areinsome way descriptive ofit.
Since scanning frequencies lieinthe interval from zero toafew cycles per second, the scanner data signals usually have periodicities intheaudio range.
The signals mentioned above can take either oftwo forms.
1.Continuous a-fsignals can beused, the information being carried interms oftheamplitude, thefrequency, orthephase with respect toafixed reference.
Uptothe present time this technique has been very little used.
2.Pulse-timing techniques can beapplied.
Data can betransferred interms ofthe frequency ofasingle train ofpulses, the degree of IAsubcarrier isasine wave, usually intheaudio- orvideo-frequency range, which, after ithas hem modulsted bythe information-bearing signals, isused tomodulate an r-f,carrier, 684 RADAR RELAY [SEC.
17.3 staggering oftwo trains, orthe lapse oftime between a“basic” pulse which isone ofatrain and asecond pulse occurring acon- trolled time later inthesame cycle.
Omitting forthemoment allquestions ofamplitude versus frequency modulation, and allproblems ofexternal interference, the choice ofa data-transmission system involves three intricately related questions: (1)how toavoid interference with the video and trigger signals and mutual interference among the various data signals; (2)whether touse c-w orpulse methods; (3)which geometrical quantities among those descriptive ofthe scanner motion can best bechosen fortransmission.
Since the video signals contain frequencies from nearly zero uptoa few megacycles per second itisnot feasible toseparate scanner data signals and radar echo signals on‘abasis oftheir frequency components.
This leaves the two alternatives oftime-sharing within the radar pulse cycle, ortheuseofone ormore subcarriers.
Inthe timi-sharing method the scanner data are sent during the “rest” interval attheend oftheradar cycle when theindicators areidle and thevideo signals arenotuseful.
The interval can beoccupied byas many signals asare necessary tocarry the information.
Pulse-timing techniques areusually used with time sharing since they aresomewhat simpler and probably more accurate than those involving interrupted continuous waves.
Itisusually possible toallow some ofthe pulses to take part inthetransmission ofmore than one piece ofdata.
Often the modulator pulse itself isused aspart ofthis timing system.
When the subcarrier method isadopted, itiscustomary touse con- tinuous waves rather than pulses, partly forreasons ofsimplicity and partly because ofsmaller bandwidth requirements.
When c-wsignals are used, the various components ofthe scanner data can bedistinguished from one another bysending each onaseparate subcarrier, orbyusing a different audio frequency foreach signal and transmitting them together onasingle subcarrier.
The geometrical quantities transmitted canbechosen invarious ways, depending ontheapplication.
The most important are: 1.Changes inthe orientation ofthe scanner can betransmitted by means ofawave train inwhich one cycle represents anadvance of the scanner through agiven small increment ofangle.
Ifthe scanner velocity isconstant orchanges only slowly, thewave train can beasinusoid, orconvertible into asinusoid; hence asynchro- nous motor may beused inthe scan converter.
Some method of adjusting theinitial phase ofthe converter relative tothescanner nnd ofrecognizing alignment must beprovided.
This general SEC, 17.4] METHODS OF COMBATING INTERFEREA’CE 685 method issatisfactory only fortransmitting continuous rotation at afairly constant rate.
2.Theangle itself canbetranstitted titerms oftherelative phasesof two sets ofperiodic signals which areusually either sinusoids or pulse trains (Sec.
17.5).
Since this isasingle-valued method, no zero-phase adjustment need bemade.
Itcantherefore beused for sector scanning, orforint,errupted scanning.
Thedatacan beused toposition ascan converter bymeans ofaphase-sensitive mecha- nism, orthey can beused directly toprovide electrical information forsuch anindicator asaB-scope.
3.The values ofthe sine and the cosine ofthe scan angle can be transmitted inany ofseveral ways (Sec.
17.7).
Transmission of sine and cosine isalso asingle-valued method.
The data can be used tocontrol ascan converter ordirectly inelectronic PP1’s or related indicators.
17.4.
Methods ofCombating Interference.-Aside from providing the best possible signal-to-interference intensity ratio atthe receiver input, theprincipal method ofminimizing theeffects ofinterference isto take advantage ofdifferences between the desired and the undesired signals.
The~fferences, \vhichshould deliberately bemadelarge, canbe exploited both byusing them asabasis forexcluding theundesired signals from the operating device and bymaking that device asinsensitive as possible tointerfering signals that arenot excluded.
Unwanted signals can berejected byfrequency discrimination; thebulk oftheinterference isexcluded inthis way.
How-ever, since itisalways necessary tohave a finite bandwidth toadmit thenecessary information, some interference is likely togetthrough totheanalyzer.
Inthecase ofthescanning data, itisoften possible toprotect against transient interference (orabsence ofsignals) byexploiting electrical or mechanical inertia.
Care must betaken that the inertia does not appreciably inhibit satisfactory response toscanning accelerations, a serious restriction ifsector scanning isinvolved.
Asecond, and more promising, method ofapproach istotake advan- tage ofapproximate knowledge ofwhat the real signals should doby excluding completely allinformation that does not closely agree with expect ation, just astuned circuits orfilters reject signals outside their pass band.
The knowledge onwhich tobase the selection may beavailable apriori, oritmay depend partly onamemory ofwhat hashappened inthe immediate past.
Asanexample ofsuch methods consider aninformation-bearing pulse.
Very similar pulses with the same frequency components asthe signals are likely tobepresent inthe interference and ofcourse cannot be 686 RADAR RELAY [SEC.
17.4 excluded bythe receiver.
If,however, theseinterferingp ulsesarenottoo numerous and strong, itispossible toprovide almost complete protection against them byusing a“coded” signal torepresent the pulse, orby excluding allpulses that donot come within the narrow time interval which follows thelast useful pulse bytheknown repetition period, orby doing both.
The most usual type ofcoding consists ofagroup ofpulses succeeding each other byprecise, unequal time intervals.
The responsive circuit at the receiver isarranged torecognize only agroup with precisely these spacings.

Thus three pulses occurring atO,2,and 6psec appear across resistance Rand pass tothe mixer tobecombined with the video and other signals.
Other combinations oftime delay can, ofcourse, beused.

After passing through the cathode follower V~., each pulse arrives twice atthe grid ofV3*, once with nodelay and once with a 2-psec delay.
Sixpulses will therefore arrive atVW,and two ofthese, the first delayed pulse and thesecond undelayed pulse, will beincoincidence, asthewaveform diagram shows.
Thus five pulses, the second ofwhich hasdouble amplitude, will arrive atthegrid ofVAafter afurther delay of 4~sec.
VAissobiased that only thelarge pulse lifts thegrid past cutoff.
Since thetotal delay ofthis pulse is6psec, itsarrival will coincide with that ofthethird undelayed pulse onthesuppressor ofV,.
Atthis time, and this time only, theplate ofV4receives asignal and fires Vs..
This event cannot occur ifany ofthe pulses ismissing; therefore interference canproduce aresult only when three spurious pulses occur with approxi- mately thecorrect spacing.
Differentiation attheinput circuit prevents 688 RADAR RELAY [SEC.
174 long signals from straddling two ormore pulse intervals and thus provid- ing false coincidences.
Itcannot, ofcourse, prevent such blocks of signals from saturating thereceiver and excludlng the desired pulses.
Abrief analysis ofthe effectiveness ofthe coding isworth while.
Periodic pulses cannot give aresponse from V,unless their frequency is greater than the reciprocal ofthe delay times inthe coding.
Random pulses ornoise do, however, have afinite probability ofinitiating a response.
Tocalculate thk probability suppose that there arenrandom pulses per second and letrbetheir length.
Then the fractional time during which thegrid ofVdbisreceiving signals through thedelay lineism.
The probability that asignal from agiven undelayed pulse will overlap that from thedelayed pulses istherefore Zrm,thefactor 2entering onthe assumption that any overlap atallwill produce aresult.
Thus the number ofreinforced signals reaching the grid ofVieach second is2n%.
Since the probability that one ofthese will coincide with apulse onthe suppressor grid isn7,1the total number ofpulses triggering V,each second is2n’rz.
This istobecompared with the number nofinter- fering signals originally present, theratio ofimprovement being n/2n3r2 =l/2n2r2.
If,forexample, r=1psec and n=10,000, this ratio is5000.
The ratio improves forsmaller nand vice versa.
Ifthe signal being relayed isthe firing time ofthe modulator, the firing should, ifpossible, coincide with thetransmission ofthethird pulse.
Ifthe modulator can betriggered with sufficient accuracy, the output connection indicated in-Fig.
17.2 can beused forthis purpose.
If,on theother hand, themodulator isself-synchronous, itspulse must beused totrigger the coder.
The synchronizing pulse atthe receiving station, which must await the arrival ofthe third pulse, will be6~sec late.
If this error cannot betolerated, thevideo signals must bepassed through a 6-psec delay line before they reach theindicators.
Figure 17.3 also illustrates one method for excluding allsignals except during aninterval surrounding theexpected time ofarrival ofthe desired signal.
The coincidence pulse from theplate ofViispassed, after buffering inVw,through a2-Asec delay line, and isused totrigger the flip-flop circuit formed by V* and V6b (Sec.

Somewhat more elegant methods which allow narrower open intervals canbeused incertain special cases inwhich the opening ofthe switch can becontrolled from asequence ofevents within the cycle.
Various arrangements will appear inlater sections in connection with specific methods ofdata transmission.
17.6.
The Method ofIncremental Angle.-This section and thenext three will describe various specific methods ofrelaying the scanner information, the basis ofclassification being the geometrical quantities used.
Asstated inSec.
17.2, the method ofangular increments usually involves, asafinal stage, asynchronous motor driven byasinusoid.
Three methods ofrelaying thenecessary data have been used.
Inthe first method, the sinusoid itself may betransmitted directly onasubcarrier.
The extra expenditure ofpower involved isusually not justifiable forthis rather inflexible method, especially since the pulse methods areextremely simple.
Asasecond method, themodulator pulses themselves can beused to represent the increments ofscanner angle 1ifthe scanner motion can be made sufficiently constant tocontrol the modulator triggering satis- factorily.
Such asystem isrepresented inFig.
17.4.2 Some form of signal generator—usually electromagnetic-geared tothe scanner pro- duces periodic signals offrequency proportional tothe scanner velocity and suitable forthepulse recurrence frequency.
These signals control a blocking oscillator orsome other device toproduce sharp pulses which are then coded fortransmission over the relay link.
The third pulse ofthe code (from point EofFig.

Ifthe transmitter provides higher power inthepulses than inthe video signals, amplitude selection can be used, and the coded pulses can simply bepassed tothe transmitter.
Otherwise, thecoded pulses must bedistinguished intime, and theextra equipment indicated bythe dotted boxes must beused.
The video switch (Sec.
13.9) isarranged topass video signals only when theflip-flop (Sec.
13.7) ison,and pulses only when itisoff.
The flip-flop isfired bythe modulator trigger, sothat video signals arepassed until shortly before the next cycle, atwhich time the flip-flop opens the switch forpulses until themodulator pulse occurs again.
Atthe receiving station, signals from the receiver pass toaswitch which isopen when apulse code isexpected.
Following this switch isa decoder similar tothat ofFig.

The resulting single pulses serve to trigger theindicators, tocontrol thesignal-selecting switch, and toprovide therotation.
The switching action issimilar tothat ofV,aj Vlb, Vti,and VwofFig.

The resulting puIses, bytriggering ascale-of-two circuit similar tothat ofFig.

Abroadband a-ffilter removes the higher harmonics, leaving asine wave atthefundamental frequency which, after amplification, powers asynchronous motor that drives adata transmitter.
Proper initial phasing ofthe data-transmitter shaft can bemade by methods analogous tothose ofdisplay-sector selection (Chap.

Aconvenient index foruseinthis alignment can beprovided bytransmitting one ormore angle markers along with the video signals, asillustrated inFig.

The delayed pulse ismixed with thecoding forthebasic pulse onthecommon cathode resistor Rand sent tothe master mixer.

When VTCfires, itscathode drives the l-psec delay line, and the delayed pulse returns through VTb toturn offthe blocking oscillator.
Thus successive I-ysec pulses, adjacent intime, appear atthe grids ofV8band VE~respectively.

Iftheappearance oftheazimuth pulse atshort range ontheindicators isnot tolerable, atriggered modulator can befired after the azimuth pulse, thedelay from thethird coded pulse being precisely fixed.
Atthe receiver asimilar delay initiated bythe decoded basic pulse can be inserted ‘ahead ofthe indicators.
Correct adjustment ofthis delay can easily bemade byobserving the transmitter pulse appearing with the video signals.
No analogous method ofazimuth-pulse removal exists for aself- synchronous modulator.
Itisusually satisfactory toremove thepulse by anticoincidence methods, even though a“hole” isleft inthevideo signal train.
Otherwise, itwillbenecessary tointroduce between themodulator pulse and the basic pulse adelay which islonger than the useful video- signal interval and totransmit both pulses.

Atthereceiving end the video signals and each ofthe subcarriers are separated byappropriate filters and the phase-shifted and the reference sinusoids areobtained by suitable demodulators.
The reference wave isthen passed through a phase shifter similar tothat onthescanner.
This phase shifter isdriven byaservomechanism whose error signal isthe output ofacircuit which compares the phase ofthe shifted wave and that ofthe reference wave.

T\vo general methods are possible: mechanical duplication ofthe scanner motion atthe receiving station (asinthe previous cases), oruse ofthe sine and cosine voltages toproduce the two necessary PP1 range-sweep “omponents.” Derivation ofmechanical motion from sine and cosine information requires theuseofaservomechanism.
Practically speaking, itisneces- sary, inorder toreproduce themechanical motion, toprovide a-cvoltages proportional tosine and cosine, aswell asavoltage ofconstant amplitude for reference purposes.
.111 voltages must have the same frequency and phase.
From the terminal-equipment standpoint these voltages could 702 RADAR RELAY [SEC.17.7 beobtained most simply byexciting asynchro ontheradar scanner and relaying each ofthe resulting voltage “components” together with aconstant reference voltage (Fig.
17”9).
This method, which would require theuseofmultiple subcarriers, and would thus involve excessive bandwidth, complex multiple modulation and filtering, orboth, hasnever been used.
Two component voltages and one reference voltage can be provided atdifferent a-cfrequencies, but this arrangement isnotsuitable foruse with aservomechanism.
Itcan, however, beused toproduce slowly varying sine and cosine voltages.
These canthen beused tomodu- late alternating current ofproper frequency toprovide therequired volt- age components forasynchro-controlled servomechanism.

Incontrast tothe reproduction ofmechanical motion, the fixed-coil PPI can best use slowly varying polarized direct current.
1Since alter- nating current can easily be rectified togive such voltages, any ofthe methods isapplicable tothis case.
As shown inFig.
17.10b, the sweep components are produced by sawtooth generators using the signal volt- ages astheir source potentials sothat the ‘‘sawteeth” are modulated in the proper manner asthe scanner rotates (Sec.

Through the provision oflow-impedance ormultiple-output circuits for the sine and cosine voltages, asmany indicators asdesired can beused.
The sweep length for each can bechosen independently ofthose ofthe others.
1Itisposeible, ofcourse, torelay the sweep components themselves.
However, a separate subcarrier would berequired for each.
Furthermore, each “sawtooth” must endure for the time ofthe longest desired sweep, and fast sweeps must be achieved byamplification ofashort segment.
Errors would begreatly magnified in such aprocess.

This voltage ismixed with aconstant-amplitude a-fsignal of frequency fj(which isused forAGC atthereceiver), and thecombination isused tomodulate asubcarrier ofsomewhat higher frequency than the maximum required forvideo signals.
The modulated carrier, thevideo signals, and thetrigger pulse arethen mixed and passed ontothetrans- mitter proper.
Atthereceiving station, thevarious component signals are separated byappropriate filters, asindicated inFig.

The resulting voltages con- tain ad-c component ofmagnitude C(with respect tothedetector bias point) and avarying component ofamplitude D,the sum being always positive.
The d-ccomponent can beprevented from affecting thefinal device byrelating itsbias level properly tothat ofthe detector.

17.8]PULSE METHOD FORRELAYING SINEANDCOSINE 707 separate channel.
There must now be developed ad-c voltage whose value isatevery instant proportional tothe delay ofthesine pulse with respect tothebasic pulse.
Two ofthemany possible methods ofaccom- plishing this areillustrated.
The components ofFig.
17.13a drawn insolid lines illustrate avery simple method.
The basic pulse triggers aflip-flop having alifetime slightly greater than the maximum delay ofthe sine pulse; theresulting square wave isused toswitch asawtooth generator of very low output impedance.
Thus, within the lifeofthe sawtooth, the instantaneous voltage atSisproportional totime elapsed since the occurrence ofthebasic pulse.
When thesine pulse occurs, itmomentar- ilycloses the “double clamp” (similar toFig.
1326), thus connecting point Ttightly topoint Ssothat thecondenser ischarged totheinstan- taneous potential ofS.
The leakage path from Ttoground ismade to have ahigh resistance sothat thepotential atTremains essentially con- stant until the new cycle, atwhich time itwill take anew value corre- sponding tothenew value ofthetime delay ofthesine pulse.
Thus the potential atTwill gothrough thesame variations asthetime delay and will inthepresent case have theform A+Bsinoasdesired.
This very simple method issatisfactory provided little ornointerference isencoun- tered.
Aninterfering pulse will, however, cause Ttotake apotential corresponding toitstime ofappearance.
This effect can bereduced by filtering sothat nosingle pulse can cause any very great change, but this filtering may cause troublesome phase lags inthe desired output.
A better method ofprotection istoemploy theoutput voltage tocontrol the opening ofaswitch (dotted circuits inFig.
17.13a), through which thesine pulse must pass, insuch away that apulse canbeadmitted only during a very narrow time interval including the time when the true pulse is expected.
(Since this device asdescribed will work only when thetrack- ingisalready nearly right, some means must beprovided forholding the switch open until correct conditions are once established.
)With the addition ofthis protective switch, the method ofFig.
17.13a issatis- factory.
The addition makes it,however, nearly ascomplex asmore elegant methods ofregenerative tracking.
Regenerative tracking, although more complex, provides certain very definite advantages in compensating forerrors occurring later inthecircuit.
The elements ofaregenerative tracking circuit are shown inFig.
17.13b.
The basic pulse triggers adelay circuit which iscontrolled bythe final output voltage insuch away that, assuming this voltage isright, the delay circuit produces apulse shortly before thearrival ofthesine pulse.
The delay-circuit pulse triggers aflopover (Sec.
13.7) which inturn sends apulse down animproperly terminated delay line.
The reflected pulse, ofopposite polarity, turns offthe flopover.
The resulting square 708 RADAR ltELAY [SEC.1743 wave from the flopover isused toopen the sine pulse switch for25~sec orsoattheexpected time ofarrival ofthe sine pulse.
1 The delayed pulse reaches thefarend ofthedelay line exactly atthe middle ofthe switching wave.
The remainder ofthe circuit isdesigned toforce thk “comparison” pulse into time coincidence with the sine pulse byproperly controlling the delay through adjustment ofthe out- put voltage.
Various methods can beused toaccomplish this adjust- ment.
The operation ofthemethod illustrated isdescribed below.
The comparison pulse triggers aflip-flop.
The square waves from the two plates, one positive and one negative, arefedtothecontrol grids ofapair ofpentodes (Fig.
17.13c), turning one onand the other off.
The screen grids, normally atcathode potential, receive the positive sine pulse.
If thepulse arrives when thecontrol.grid ofagiven tube ison,that tube will produce anegative pulse onitsplate.
The signals are integrated in opposite polarity oncondenser Clbymeans ofthe diodes.
Anegative signal from Vjdrives anegative charge through V3.toCl.
Asignal from V,drives anegative charge toground through VWThe potential onC, isthe output signal.
Itisreturned (perhaps after amplification) tothe comparison-pulse delay circuit which itcontrols.
Thus, ifthe switch- ing occurs before the arrival ofthe sine pulse, VIconducts, Clbecomes more positive, and thedelay isincreased.
Iftheswitching istoolate, Vt conducts and thedelay isdecreased.
The process continues onsuccessive cycles until thedelay issuch that thesine pulse” straddles” theinstant of switching.
The delay circuit will then follow thevariations inthedelay ofthesine pulse sothat the output voltage varies inthedesired manner.

Byclosing the relay onto point Y and inserting aproper electronic switch between Xand Y,themodulator trigger signal can beused asaswitching signal when cyclical time sharing with beacon orother signals isdesired.
Ifnosuch need isinvolved, the cosine pulse can serve also asthemodulator trigger signal sothat delay circuit acan beomitted and points Band Cmade the same.
The coded pulses and the video signals aremade toshare the radar cycle byaswitch operated byaflip-flop keyed bythemodulator trigger, asdescribed inprevious cases.
Atthe receiving station, the pulses must first beseparated from the video signals and from one another.
The “sequencing” circuits which accomplish thelatter areshown onthe top row ofthe diagram.
After being decoded, the signals pass toseveral switches ofthe multiple-grid variety shown inFig.
13.27.
The numbers alongside each indicate to which grid thevarious signals areapplied.

The sine pulse, inaddition toitstracking role, triggers aflip-flop controlling the cosine-pulse switch, and thecosine pulse similarly triggers aflip-flop con- trolling themodulator pulse switch.
The modulator pulse ispassed onto theindicators and, inaddition, triggers aflip-flop which closes theswitch ahead ofthedecoder while video signals arebeing received, and opens it shortly before thenext basic pulse.
Afew words should besaid about theprocess of“locking in” initially orafter tracking has been lost through failure ofsignals orsevere inter- ference.
Since themain switch iscontrolled byaflip-flop, itwill sooner orlater beopen.
Ifnopulse occurs during theopen interval, this switch will close, but itwill beopened again bythenext pulse.

Inpractice, the right combination is promptly found, and thevarious pulses then pass through thesequencing circuits intheproper manner.

A-c signals forthescan converter areobtained bymodulating the60-cps line voltage with the sine and cosine voltages, asinFig.

The regenerative tracking assists greatly inovercoming errors inthe modu- lators byrectifying the modulated alternating current with aphase- sensitive detector and using this result tocontrol the tracking delay circuit.
Thus the amplitude ofthe modulated alternating current (which isthequantity ofprimary interest) isforced tovary inthesame manner asthe delay inthe signal pulse, regardless oferrors inthe comparison circuits, themodulator, any amplifiers, etc.
Equipment essentially like that just described has had agreat deal ofuse and initsfinal form has proved satisfactory.
Anentire system using this method isdescribed inSec.

17.9.
Comparison ofSynchronization Methods.-Not allthe syn- chronization methods described inthe previous sections have been used onactual radar relay systems although nearly allofthem have been setup and tested inthe laboratory.
Because ofthe inadequacy oftesting in many ofthe cases, evaluations are difficult, but the following general statements can bemade.
PulseUS.C-UIMethods.
—Pulse methods have been much more highly developed than those using c-w transmission, partly because ofthepulse- circuit experience available atthe Radiation Laboratory, and partly because the r-fequipment available during most ofthework was ofthe amplitude-modulation rather than the frequency-modulation type.
However, much can besaid infavor ofthepulse methods from afunda- mental standpoint, regardless ofthetype ofcarrier modulation.
1.Since one pulse, the trigger, isinvolved inany method, adequate protection against pulse interference must beprovided inany case.
2.When time sharing isused within theradar cycle, thepulse methods require less complex r-fequipment than dothe c-w methods with their requirement foratleast one subcarrier.
Were time sharing with thevideo signals abandoned and the pulses sent onasub- carrier, the additional complications would becompensated by considerable simplification and increased effectiveness ofthetermi- nalequipment.
The synchronization signals would automatically beseparated from the video signals.
The use of100 per cent of the time and the freedom from restrictions imposed by the radar PRF would lessen the sensitivity tointerference and permit much more flexibility than isavailable with the time-sharing technique. 712 RADAR RELAY [SEC.
17.9 Such amethod would beextremely advantageous ifmultiple sets ofangular data were toberelayed.
3.Pulse methods are inherently more accurate than c-w methods since they involve either” counting” orthemeasurement oftime probably the most accurate types ofphysical measurements that can bemade.
Furthermore, nodependence whatever isplaced on the linearity ofr-fmodulators, amplifiers, detectors, etc., incon- trast tothec-w methods where allsuch devices must beextremely linear and free from dk.tortion.
Onthe other hand, c-w methods involve somewhat simpler terminal equipment than dothepuke methods.
They arealso much lesssuscepti- bletopulse interference, which isthetype most likely tobemet with at most ofthe radio frequencies involved.
Comparison ofSpecijic Methods.—The specific synchronization methods that have bee~ most thoroughly tested are— 1.The conveying ofsine and cosine bypulses.
2.The conveying ofangular increments bythemodulator pulses.
3.The conveying ofangular increments bythe sinusoidally varied pulse.
4.The method ofphase-shifted pulses.
5.The conveying ofsine and cosine bya-fsignals ofdifferent fre- quencies.
Certain qualitative comparisons among these arepossible.
The method ofrelaying angular increments bymodulator-pulse timing isbyfarthe simplest ifitcan beused, which isonly when the scanner rotates very uniformly and can beexactly synchronized with the modu- lator.
Unfortunately, thetests ofthk method were made inconnection with anairborne radar inwhich the scanning rate varied considerably; hence appreciable inertia could not beused.
Furthermore, multiple- pulse coding had notbeen adopted atthat time.
Asaresult, interference led tosomewhat erratic results.
Since noopportunity has arisen for testing with aproper radar and with coded pukes, itisdifficult tomake an accurate assessment, but the comparative success under unfavorable conditions indicates that when properly applied the method can be satisfactory.
Ifthescanning isfairly uniform but cannot besynchronized with the modulator, the method ofthe sinusoidally varied pulse (Sec.
17.5) gives very satisfactory results with aminimum ofcomplexity asproved bya reasonable amount oftesting (See.
17.15).
This method issomewhat less susceptible tointerference effects than Method 2since more data are sent perradar cycle and since anextra pulse does notcause anirreversible effect.
The method ofrelaying sine and cosine data bypulse-timing tech- . SEC.
17.10] THERADIATION PATH 713 niques has given satisfactory results even under very severe interference conditions.
Itcan, ofcourse, follow sector, aswell ascontinuous, scanning.
Itsprincipal drawback isitsrelative complexity, but much ofthecomplication inFig.
17.14 arises from extreme precautions against interference and from the necessity ofoperating aservomechanism.
Were fixed-coil PPI’s used, orwere itpossible tooperate aservomecha- nism satisfactorily from d-csignals, theequipment would beconsiderably simplified.
Afarsimpler model operating fixed-coil PPI’s and designed forless severe interference conditions has seen considerable successful service.
The phase-shifted puke method isquite comparable tothe sine- cosine method ineffectiveness; itsmethod ofconverting tomechanical motion issomewhat simpler, and ithas considerably fewer adjustments.
Since more data aretransmitted perradar cycle, greater protection against interference isprobably afforded.
Although this method isofmore recent origin than the sine-cosine method, has not been sohighly devel- oped, and has nothad such thorough test% itappears tobemtisfactory.
The sine-cosine method using multiple a-f signals isinprinciple quite simple and should prove satisfactory.
Although ithas been successfully operated inanactual system (not atthe Radiation Labora- tory), the author isnot aware ofany extensive tests inthe presence of interference.
This method requires more complicated and wider-band transmitting and receiving equipment than dothepulsed methods which involve time sharing.
THE RADIO-FREQUENCY EQUIPMENT Inselecting theradio-frequency equipment, therequirements tobemet and theoperational conditions must becarefully considered.
Among the important factors are the station locations (land-, water-, orair-based), themaximum range required, thetypes ofinterference tobemet, and the nature ofthe data tobetransmitted.
These factors affect many ofthe variables ofthedesign, such asthetypes ofantennas chosen, ther-fpower necessary, the carrier frequency most desirable, and the mechanical construction oftheequipment.
17.10.
Antennas, Frequencies, and theRadiation Path.-The antenna gain should beashigh aspracticable atboth stations.
For agiven transmitted power, thesignal discernibility isalways directly proportional tothe gain ofthe transmitting antenna.
Atthe receiving station the signal-t o-internal-noise ratioisalso proportional tothe antenna gain.
and considerable interference reduction isaccomplished bythedirection- ality that accompanies high gain.
Such antennas therefore permit the useofmuch lower power toachieve agiven result than would berequired with omnidirectional antennas.
Highly directional antennas can always beused for transmkaion 714 RADAR RELAY [SEC.
17.10 between fixed ground stations since they can bepermanently oriented in the correct direction.
Very high, even microwave, frequencies are desirable forsuch applications since directional antennas can then be small, rugged, and easily constructed and installed.
Atleast one micrw wave equipment has been successfully used inexperimental tests (Sees.
17.14 and 17.15).
When one orboth stations aremoving, onthe other hand, itisneces- sary either touse sufficiently wide antenna patterns toprovide coverage inallthe necessary directions, orelse toprovide forautomatic pointing ofthe antenna, with the consequent added complexity and weight.
(If several receiving stations are involved the transmitting antenna must cover them all.)Asaresult, lower frequencies (100 to900 Me/see) have predominated insuch applications since more power isavailable and higher antenna gains can beobtained with agiven pattern.
Incases involving transmission from aircraft, certain interference effects described below are much ‘less troublesome atlow frequencies than atvery high frequencies.
Insystems tested atthe Radiation Laboratory forthe transmission ofdata from anaircraft tothe ground, elementary antenna arrays have been used.
One system, operating at300 Me/see, had avertically polarized dipole mounted onthetail section oftheaircraft and two verti- cally stacked dipoles atthe receiving station.
The vertical gain ofthis latter antenna improved somewhat theratio ofsignal toinherent and to local noise, but didnot reduce interference appreciably since little inter- ference comes from high angles.
Inatest ofa100-M c/sec relay equip- ment, the transmitting antenna was aquarter-wave vertical radiator mounted onthe skin ofanaircraft and acorresponding vertical quarter- wave receiving antenna was used atthe ground station.
When alink was established ‘at800 to900 Me/see, itwas found very desirable toincrease the gain ofthetwo antennas inorder toextend the usable range oftheequipment.
This was accomplished byusing stacked dipoles atboth the transmitting and receiving stations.
These arrays had auniform horizontal pattern and some gain inthevertical plane.
Associated ornear-by equipments often constitute aserious source of interference; consequently both antenna and power-line filters aredesira- bleatthereceiving station.
Frequently these must bedesigned toreject aparticular frequency being radiated byanear-by antenna.
Conversely, itisoften necessary tofilter the r-foutput ofthe relay transmitter in order tominimize theradiation ofharmonics that interfere with near-by receivers.
The specific filters required foragiven installation must be designed tomeet theoperational requirements ofaspecific system involv- ing agiven complement ofradar, communication, and navigational equipment.
Nogeneral rules can begiven. SEC.

Figure 17.16 shows curves ofsignal strength asa function ofrange for receiver antenna heights of75, 110, and 140ft above thesurface ofthesea.
These curves indicate themanner inwhich theeffects ofsignal cancellation can bereduced byusing diversity recep- tion with antennas atdifferent heights.
Asimple diversity system might consist oftwo antennas respectively 75and 140 ftabove the sea, with arrangements forswitching the receiver tothe antenna providing the greater signal strength atany given moment.
Ineffect, this reduces the depths ofthe cancellation minima ineither ofthe antennas considered separately.
Future Trends inFrequency .—Frequencies most generally used for radar relay have been intheregion from onetoafew hundred megacycles per second, partly forreasons ofachievable power, higher gains ofnon- directional antennas, and soon.
Future trends appear tolead toward higher frequencies, uptoand including microwaves.
Comparatively speaking, theuse ofsuch frequencies ischaracterized bythe possibility ofusing simple, highly directional antennas, bylow gain inomnidirectional antennas, byreduction inman-made static (except forpulse interference from radars), byagreat increase inthe overwater diffraction effect, byalarge number ofavailable channels, and bytherelatively low power now available forc-w operation.

Until recently it was not economical touse a-fmodulation ofmicrowaves because ofthe extreme oscillator-stability requirements necessary toavoid excessive bandwidth.
However, ahighly ingenious application ofamicrowave discriminator incombination with afeedback amplifier controlling the oscillator frequency appears toovercome this difficulty and topermit theuse ofc-w synchronization methods.
For applications requiring omnidirectional antennas, theranges sofar obtained atfrequencies above 300 Me/see have been rather limited, espe- cially insituations involving diffraction effects.
Asgreater power becomes available atthehigher frequencies, they will undoubtedly find more and more applications even where itisnot possible touse highly directed beams.
The diffraction difficulty can largely beovercome bythecareful useofdiversity antennas.
17.11.
General Transmitter and Receiver Considerations.-Although the specific characteristics desirable inthe transmitter and receiver depend upon theparticular application, certain general statements canbe made.
The transmitter should provide sufficient power toensure clear signals, free from noise and interference, atthe maximum required range.
In common with allcomponents, itmust have sufficient bandwidth toaccom- modate the band offrequencies present.
The receiver should have a satisfactory noise figure, aproper bandwidth, and inmany cases must provide special means ofdistinguishing between desired and undesired signals bymethods analogous totheantijamming techniques described inSec.
12.8.
Automatic gain control isnecessary toprevent strong signals from overloading the receiver, and toinsure that signals are applied tothedecoder atthecorrect level.
Bandwidth varies with the particular characteristics oftheradar set and thetype ofsynchronization used.
Ingeneral, thevideo sections will have abandwidth between 1and 3Me/see, with corresponding r-fand i-fbandwidths from 2to6Me/see, when normal search radar systems are used.
Since therelay link isonly one section oftheover-all channel, the bandwidths ofitscomponents must besomewhat greater than would be necessary ifitalone were involved.
Animportant decision isthechoice between amplitude and frequency modulation.
The relative advantages and disadvantages ofthese two methods are somewhat different for pulsed and for c-w signals, and depend also upon the type ofinterference expected.
The principal advantage offrequency modulation isthis: ifthecarrier power isappreci- ably greater than that ofaninterfering signal, the latter tends tobe 1R.V.Pound, “An Electronic Frequency Stabilization System forCWMicro- wave Oscillators, ”RLReport No.815, Oct.
1,1945; Rev.Sci.Inst.17,490(1946). 718 RADAR RELAY [SEC.
17.11 suppressed.
Frequency modulation isthus helpful incases where itis desirable toremove thelast traces oflow-level interference.
Such inter- ference reduction iseffective only ifalarge deviation ratio isused, that is,ifthe ratio ofhalf the maximum carrier-frequency excursion tothe maximum modulation frequency islarge.
(Adeviation ratio of4is considered excellent.
)This requirement increases the necessary band- width ofthe r-fparts ofthe transmitter, and ofthe r-fand i-fstages of the receiver.
This increase presents additional transmitter circuit prob- lems, and reduces the gain inthe amplifier stages.
Inthe receiver, the greater bandwidth admits more interference inaddition tocomplicating thereceiver design.
The most important aspects oftherelative virtues ofthetwo types of modulation arise, however, inconnection with the consideration of particular types ofsignals and interference.
For example, ifpulse synchronization signals arereceived atalevel appreciably above that of interference, amplitude-selection methods can entirely exclude theinter- ference, regardless ofthetype ofmodulation.
This gives theamplitude- modulation method adefinite advantage because the low duty ratio of the synchronization pulses makes itpossible totransmit them atpeak powers several times higher than the permissible averagel and thus assists these signals tooverride the interference.
Afairly high ratio of peak toaverage power can also bemaintained forvideo signals since, except inextreme cases, echoes arereceived foronly asmall fraction ofthe time.
Infrequency modulation, onthe other hand, the carrier operates ataconstant power level.
Nosuch advantages exist foramplitude modulation inconnection with c-w synchronization methods.
Low-level, more orless cent inuous interference can bevery disturbing, and thenatural suppressing effect of the limiter and discriminator inanf-m receiver can beofvery great advantage.
Furthermore, the use ofsubcarriers and carriers ofhigher order can bemost readily accomplished inasystem which isfrequency- modulated throughout.
The above discussion, admittedly rather hypothetical inthe absence ofextended comparative tests, might besummarized asfollows: 1.Amplitude modulation methods seem preferable forthe relaying ofsynchronization pulses (ofwhich there isalways atleast one), the advantage increasing -with the strength oftheinterference.
2.There isprobably little tochoose between AJI and FM with respect tothe video signals.
Ifthe interference issevere, the higher peak powers and narrower bandwidths possible with ampli- 1This isusually accomplished bycombining grid modulation byboth the video and the pulse signals with plate modulation bypulses only. SEC.

3.Frequency-modulation methods are definitely preferable forc-w synchronization signals.
The following sections give brief descriptions ofsome actual equip- ments.

A300-Mc/sec Amplitude-modulated Equipment.—Largely because ofitsavailability, thetype ofr-fequipment most used atRadia- tion Laboratory consists ofamodification ofanamplitude-modulated television transmitter-receiver combination operating inthe 300-Mc/sec region (specifically onany of10channels between 254 and 372 Me/see).
The transmitter provides 90watts ofpeak video signal power, and 250 watts ofpulse power.
Ablock diagram ofthe transmitter isshown inFig.

Provi- sion ismade forgrid modulation byallofthe signals and foradditional plate modulation bysynchronization pulses.
Negative video and syn- chronization signals are amplified byathree-stage broadband video amplifier.
The second stage hasagain control inthecathode tocompen- sate forvariations ininput-signal amplitude.
The amplified signals drive the grids ofthe 8025 r-fpower amplifiers through acathode follower.
Since thebias forthecathode follower must remain constant forallduty ratios, ad-crestorer isused between itsgrid and the —105-volt supply.
The synchronization pulses areamplified bya4-stage video amplifier oper- ating into apulse transformer connected tothecathode ofadiode through which ther-famplifiers draw their power.
Intheabsence ofpulses, the diode isconducting and the plates ofthe r-famplifiers areconnected to the high-voltage supply (800 volts).
The arrival ofapulse disconnects thediode and raises theplate potential oftheamplifier byseveral hundred volts, resulting inavery high instantaneous power.
The master oscillator consists ofapair of8025’s inpush-pull, theplate and grid circuits being tuned bytransmission-line elements ofvariable length.
The amplitude ofoscillation iscontrolled bythe capacitive reactance ofthe filament line, and can also bevaried bychanging the length ofthe filament line.
.Change ofchannel necessitates retuning of the r-fpower amplifier byadjustment ofashort-circuiting bar onthe parallel line which constitutes the plate load.
The electrical length of the coupling loop isalso varied with the plate tuning.

The i-fbandwidth isabout 3Me/see between half-power points.
The output ofthedetector, a6AC7 connected asadiode, isapplied tothefirst video stage.
Achoice oftwo time constants isavailable inthe grid circuit ofthis stage, 0.47 secand 2.4~sec.
The longer one isnormally used; itgives good response tovery low video frequencies.
The short time constant, when used, serves the same function against extended or c-w interference assimilar circuits doinaradar receiver (Sec.
12.8).
The automatic gain control isactuated bythesynchronization pulses.
Asmall signal istaken from the plate ofthe final cathode follower, amplified, and passed toanother cathode follower.
Because ofinverse feedback, the output signal ofthis cathode follower isasharp spike, rather than aflat-topped 2-gsec pulse.
Ifthesynchronization pulses are coded, they pass through adelay line toacoincidence tube, the com- bination acting asadecoder.
The coincidence tube issobiased that only pulses will actuate it,thevideo signals being biased out atthis point by the video-level control.
The output signal ofthe coincidence tube is applied tothecathode oiadiode, whose plate potential issetbytheAGC level control.
Thus, ifthe signals from the coincidence tube are suff- iciently negative tocause the diode toconduct, thegrid ofthecathode follower which isalso connected tothe plate ofthe diode will change potential and thereby change the grid potential onthe first three i-f stages.
Along time constant inthe cathode-follower grid circuit holds the grid potential essentially constant between pulses.
There isthus a loop inwhich strong pulses produce amore negative potential onthe i-f grids toreduce thereceiver gain, and vice versa.
Itmay happen that operation ofaradar inthevicinity will overload the receiver during transmission.
Such interference can beovercome byintroducing aportion ofthe interfering radar trigger atthe interfei- ence-suppression terminals shown.
This reduces thereceiver gain atthe instant ofradar transmission, with theloss ofonly oneortwo microseconds ofvideo-signal reception.

The final stage consists ofapair of4E27 tubes operated asa Class Camplifier with anaverage r-foutput power ofabout 100watts.
The equipment isdesigned toaccommodate amaximum video bandwidth of2Me/see.
The oscillator gives amaximum linear fre- quency deviation of0.5Me/see.
Thereforej inthis and thefirst doubler stage the bandwidth need beonly the 2Me/see determined bythe video frequencies involved.
After asecond doubling, the bandwidth ismade 4Me/see inorder tosupport two sidebands oneach side of thecarrier.
After thefinal doubling, abandwidth of6Me/see would be required tosupport allthe sidebands above 5percent, but itwas found experimentally that distortion was not serious ifthe bandwidth were reduced to4hlc/sec.
This simplified theamplifier design and resulted in higher r-fpower than would otherwise have been available. SEC.

The r-f,i-f,and video sections, aswell asthediscriminator, arestand- ard indesign, an8-Me/see bandwidth inthei-famplifier being obtained bydouble staggering ofalternate stages.
Atwo-stage limiter isused to insure constant input-signal voltage atthe discriminator.
Both limiter tubes operate atreduced plate and screen voltages toreduce the grid swing necessary tocause plate limiting.
Afast time constant inthegrid circuit ofthe first limiter was chosen todiscriminate against impulse noise byproducing theYlmiting bias quickly.
Longer time constants are possible inthe second limiter since the signal variations atthk tube are neither large nor ofshort duration.
This equipment has been given extensive airborne tests inconjunction with two different types ofsynchronization equipment, and hasalso been operated between fixed ground stations.

Microwave System for Point -to-point Service.-The two equipments described inSees.
17.12 and 17”13 were developed primarily forair-to-surface work involving theuseofomnidirectional antennas; an upper limit was therefore settothepossible radio frequency.
The pres- entsection will describe equipment designed forusebetween fixed ground stations which permit theuse ofdirectional antennas.
Safe margins ofpower areeasily attainable insuch applications since themaximum range isusually sharply limited bythehorizon orbyrough- ness oftheterrain.
The received signal was specified tobe40dbabove thermal noise atmaximum range inorder toprovide asafe operating margin.

The decision between 3000 and 10,000 Me/see was based largely upon thefact that inthelatter case waveguide ofaconvenient size could beused, anextremely desirable design feature.
Since a32-mile range isadequate forthe uses intended, and since too great sharpness ofbeam might lead toalignment difficulties, 3-ft parabo- loids were used atboth stations.
Frequency modulation was chosen, partly because ofitsadvantages when signal-to-noise and signal-to-interference ratios arehigh, but mostly because itsimplified the oscillator design.
Large deviations oftheoscil- lator areeasily accomplished, and there arenoproblems ofr-fbandwidth.
Since the required video bandwidth was about 1.5 Me/see, atotal deviation of6Jfc/sec was chosen.
The total frequency spectrum involved isthen alittle more than 9hlc/sec.
Inorder tominimize the required i-fbandwidth inthe receiver, the discriminator was setonone side ofthe pass band ofthe receiver.
Avalue of1131c/sec was then chosen forthei-fbandwidth toprovide amargin totake care ofimproper tuning.
The equipment isshown schematically inFig.

17.15 RADAR RELAY SYSTEMS Two complete radar relay systems will now bedescribed; their general features are sufficiently applicable tofuture requirements tomake this worth while, even though better systems could now bedesigned.
The requirements forthetwo systems arequite different.
The first involves thetransmission between fixed ground stations ofthree sets ofradar echo signals and one setofbeacon signals, allresulting from antennas mounted onasingle continuously rotating scanner.
Although thenumber ofsets of video signals islarge, theuseofdirectional antennas eases ther-fproblem, and the continuous scan renders scanner synchronization relatively simple.
Inthesecond example, one setofradar signals and one setofbeacon signals are relayed toground from along-range airborne radar set arranged topermit sector scanning.
Incontrast totheformer case, the “picture” data are relatively simple, but the requirement oflarge angular coverage forces the use oflow-gain antennas and puts asevere requirement onthe r-fsystem.
Sector scan and the turning ofthe aircraft greatly complicate the scanner-synchronization problem.
17.15.
AGround-to-ground Relay System.—The radar set originat- ingthedata inthis example isaground-based microwave set(see Chap.
15) inwhich the scanner, rotating ateither 2or4rpm, carries two radar antennas and onebeacon antenna.
One oftheradar antennas pro- vides long-range low-angle coverage; the other provides coverage athigh angles.
Both regular video signals and MTI (Chap.
16)video signals are derived from theupper-beam signals; this beam ischosen forMTI because itistheone predominantly used attheshorter ranges where theclutter is worse.
Thus four sets ofvideo signals must betransmitted: lower-beam radar echoes, upper-beam radar echoes, upper-beam MTI video signals, and beacon responses.
Time sharing isused toput two.
sets ofvideo signals oneach oftwo carriers.
One channel isshared between theMTI video signals and the lower-beam video signals, MTI video being trans- mitted foratime interval corresponding tothe first 30to50miles of range from theradar, and thelower-beam video fortheremainder ofthe radar cycle.
Asecond channel isshared between theupper-beam radar echoes and thebeacon signals; since the data from these two aresimul- taneous, switching must bedone onawhole-cycle, rather than onafrac- tional-cycle, basis.
Two pulse cycles areallotted toradar, then one to beacon, and soon,theunequal division being used because signal sensi- tivity ismore critical inradar than inbeacon operation.
The resultant loss insensitivity is0.5dbforradar signals and 1dbforbeacon returns.
Two transmitters, feeding acommon antenna through aduplexer, are SEC.
17.15] AGROUND-TO-GROUND RELAY SYSTEM 727 used toprovide thetwo channels, since, atthetime ofdesign, equipment accommodating subcarriers was notavailable and weight and power were not crucial items.
The remaining data arecombined onthese same two channels asindicated inFig.
17.20.
The mixing and switching ofthe signals forthefirst transmitter isfairly simple.
Range markers and the proper setofangle markers aremixed with each setofvideo signals, and thetwo sets arefedtoavideo switch, which passes the MTI signals for the first 50miles orsoand the lower-beam signals thereafter.
The switch islike the circuit oftubes Vl~and VlbofFig.
17”3, buthassignals onboth grids.
The synchronizer issimilar infunction tothat ofFig.
17.5 (including Fig.
17.2), 1with the addition ofascale-of-three circuit toproduce the beacon switch pulse onevery third cycle.
The third pulse ofthemod- ulator code iscounted down forthis purpose and passed tothe signal switching unit.
The switching signal toberelayed isdelayed 16~sec (by reflection inan8-~sec delay line) inorder that itbeclear oftheazimuth pulse atthereceiving station.z The three-pulse code, theazimuth pulse, and thebeacon pulse are“mixed” byusing them alltotrigger ablocking oscillator.
The video signals tothe second transmitter are switched twice.
The upper-beam video and the beacon video are switched cyclically as described above.
The switch iscontrolled byaflopover circuit (Fig.
13.16) which remains inthe stable state that causes video switch a topass theradar signals until abeacon switch-pulse occurs; itthen passes toasecond stable state that causes the video switch topass beacon signals.
Atthe next modulator pulse the original condition isrestored.
Avideo switch provides fortime sharing between the video signals and the synchronizing pulses inorder that theformer shall not interfere with the latter.
Initsnormal position, the flip-flop holds switch bin the state that passes pulses.
Firing ofthe flip-flop by apulse delayed by 30psec from the modulator pulse reverses the video switch allowing echo signals topass.
The flip-flop returns spontaneously toits original state shortly before the start ofthe next radar cycle.
Signals from switch b arecombined with range and angle marks inavideo mixer, from which they pass totransmitter No.

Atthe receiving station, the signals pass through aduplexer totwo receivers.
The first delivers thetime-shared MTI and lower-beam video signals, together with markers, directly tothe indicators.

They pass through aswitch which excludes allsignals while video isbeing transmitted but opens shortly before the arrival ofatrigger pulse.
This switching, thedecoding ofthemodulator pulse, and the derivation ofthe scanner information from the azimuth pulse, aredone bymethods similar tothose ofFigs.
17.2 and 17.5.
The upper-beam video signals and thebeacon video signals areseparated bya video switch which consists essentially ofapair ofout-of-phase switches similar tothat made upbytubes V1~and VlbinFig.
17”3.
The video switch iscontrolled byaflopover which istriggered tothebeacon position bythebeacon switch pulse and totheradar position bythenext modula- torpulse.
The switch pulse issingled out bycoincidence with apulse derived locally (N) attheproper time bydelaying thedecoded modulator pulse.
The time occupied bythe pulse code results inthe triggering ofthe indicators 8~sec too late.
This produces aslight distortion inthe dis- plays, but there isnoerror inrange measurements since accurate range markers aretransmitted with the video signals.
The display distortion isunimportant because short-range displays arenotused.
Similarly, the fact that theindicators must beblanked outforthefirst 30~sec isofno importance since targets atsuch close range are practically never of interest.
Several r-f equipments, including the three described inearlier sections, were tried experimentally inthis application.
Alloperated with reasonable satisfaction, maximum range being limited inevery case only bythe line ofsight.
Onthe whole, the microwave equipment is considerably superior totheothers because ofitscompactness, thesmall power involved, the narrowness ofthe beam, and the greater freedom from interference.
However, thefact that theuseoffrequency modula- tion didnot permit thepulses tobetransmitted athigher level than the video signals was adefinite handicap forreasons described below.
The equipment asawhole operated about asanticipated.
Compara- tive PPI photographs taken simultaneously atthetwo stations areshown inFig.

The only difficulties ofconsequence involved occasional loss ofsynchronization, usually because ofpulse interference picked up onthe radio link oronthe radar set.
The direct results ofspurious triggers oneither theangle data orthesweep triggering were notappreci- able, but loss ofthe trigger occasionally upset the sequencing with unfortunate results.
Once theproper chain isbroken, itcanbespuriously started byinterference orbyvideo signals and remain inerror forseveral cycles.
Both the indicator sweeps and the azimuth data are then in error, sometimes byasmuch as5°or10°.
The resulting angular error persists until itismanually removed.

Amplitude selection also provides suppres- sion ofweak interference picked uponthe link itself.
With this pro- tection interruptions areextremely brief and cause little difficulty.

Relay System for Airborne Radar.-In the system just described, thescanner synchronization was rendered fairly simple bythe continuous scanning, and the problem ofobtaining adequate signal strength was simplified bytheuseofdkectional antennas.
The principal complications were those involved inthe simultaneous transmission of several sets ofvideo data.
The present section will describe briefly thearrangements used tosolve afarmore difficult problem, inwhich the data originate from al~ng-range airborne setequipped forsector scanning.
The scanner synchronization, diffi~ult inany case, isrendered farmore sobythe fact that the omnidirectional antennas required give solittle gain that theinterference problem issevere.
Every possible device must beused toprovide amaximum ofpower from the transmitter, toreject interference inthereceiver, and toprotect thesynchronization pulses by coding, byswitching, and soon.
The video data involved aresimple, consisting merely ofradar signals and ofsignals from aseparate beacon receiver.
Inorder that the two sets ofvideo signals may beaccommodated, cyclical time sharing isused during the intervals ofbeacon use, the modulator trigger serving asthe signal that radar isbeing transmitted onagiven cycle.
The design was built around the sine-cosine synchronization method ofSec.
17”9 and the 300-M c/sec amplitude-modulated r-fequipment of Sec.
1712.
Much experimentation was done, however, with thephase- shifted pulse method ofsynchronization (Sec.
17.6), and with the 100-Mc/sec frequent y-modulated r-fequipment ofSec.
1713.
The former combination isoutlined inFig.
1722, inwhich some parts peculiar tothis system and not heretofore described areshown.
Itisnecessary toprovide the azimuth data interms ofcompass directions rather than aircraft heading.
Toaccomplish this, ana-fwave ispassed through atwo-phase synchro onthe scanner and atwo-phase differential synchro controlled byacompass sothat the two resulting signals have amplitudes proportional tosin 0and cos @respectively, where 6isthe scanner orientation with respect totrue north (Sec.
13.4).
Each ofthese signals ispassed through aphase-sensitive rectifier keyed bythe audio oscillation inorder todevelop the slowly varying voltages necessary tocontrol the sine and cosine delay circuits (Sec.
17.8).
The remainder ofthe synchronizer islike that shown inFig.
17.14 except forthe provision forradar-beacon switching onalternate cycles.
During periods ofbeacon use, the relay ofFig.

When the beacon signals are not desired, the relay of Fig.

17.16 The video switch ofFig.
17.14 alternates the video signals (radar or radar alternated with beacon) with the coded pulses, and passes the results tothe transmitter (Fig.
17.22), where they ultimately modulate the grid ofthe r-fpower amplifier.
The pulses areadditionally used to modulate theplates ofthesame tubes; this arrangement provides amuch higher power inthe pulses than would otherwise beavailable.
The transmitter power isapproximately 50watts average, 80watts peak on video signals, and 175watts peak onpulses.
Anr-ffilter isprovided inthe antenna lead.
The antenna consists ofavertically polarized dipole mounted onthetailsection oftheaircraft.
Atthe receiving station, the energy isreceived byanantenna con- sisting oftwo vertically stacked dipoles and passes through aresonant cavity ofloaded Qequal to100 onitsway tothe receiver described in Sec.
17.12.
The analyzer and scan converter operate asshown inFig.
17.14, separating thevarious signals and providing asimulated scanner motion.
The separation ofvideo signals from pulses isaided byanamplitude selector which takes advantage ofthehigher power inthepulses.
This is helpful, especially during the locking-in period.
The additional parts necessary toseparate theradar and beacon data areshown inFig.
17.22.
The cosine pulse isdelayed 30psec toform atrigger available onevery cycle, regardless ofwhether radar orbeacon video signals are being transmitted.
The modulator pulse indicates those cycles onwhich radar video istransmitted.
Atrigger occurring only onthe beacon cycles can beformed byananticoincidence circuit operated bythese two pulses.
The video switch separating the two types ofvideo iscontrolled bya flopover which isthrown tothe radar position whenever the modulator pulse occurs, and back tothe beacon position bythe next cosine pulse.
The switch then passes beacon signals onevery cycle inwhich themodu- lator pulse does not occur.
This equipment gave reasonably satisfactory results initsfinal form.
Inspite ofalltheprecautions taken, however, the considerable interfer- ence from radar and communications equipment, together with the presence ofdiffraction minima, limited the reliable operating range to about 30miles when the interference was severe, and to50miles orso under reasonably favorable conditions.
These figures would besome- what improved bythe use ofdiversity antennas.
but inthe absence of tests nofigures can begiven.
Extensive tests ofthe 100-Mc/sec frequency-modulated equipment have been made under less severe interference conditions than those faced intests ofthe300-Mc/sec equipment.
At100Me/see, diffraction minima occur only atshort ranges where thesignal strength ishigh, and they are much less pronounced than those athigher frequencies, as SEC.17.16] RELAY SYSTEM FORAIRBORNE RADAR 735 indicated byFig.
17”15.
This relative freedom from cliffraction effects, together with thehigher antenna gains, gave the 100-Mc/sec equipment better performance intheabsence ofsevere interference than that ofthe 300-Mc/sec system.
Under the test conditions, satisfactory results were achieved atranges upto100 miles with the airplane flying at 10,000 ft.
However, agreat deal ofinterference exists inthis frequency band inbusy locations.
The tests did not give adequate opportunity toobserve theeffect ofthk interference inreducing themaximum range since the sites used were relatively isolated.
The phase-shifted pulse method ofsynchronization (Sec.
17.6) gave results comparable tothose ofthe sine-cosine method with either type ofr-fequipment under reasonably interference-free conditions.
Since itisslightly simpler and has fewer adjustments, itwas therefore somewhat superior under the test conditions.
