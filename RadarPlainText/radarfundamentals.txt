3•Bistatic : the transmit and receive antennas  are at different locations as  viewed from the target (e.g., ground transmitter and airborne receiver). • Monostatic : the transmitter and receiver are colocated as viewed from  the target (i.e., the same antenna is used to transmit and receive). • Quasi-monostatic : the transmit  and receive antennas are slightly  separated but still appear to  be at the same location as  viewed from the target  (e.g., separate transmit  and receive antennas on  the same aircraft).Radio Detection and Ranging   TARGET TRANSMITTER  (TX)RECEIVER  (RX) INCIDENT  WAVE FRONTSSCATTERED  WAVE FRONTS RtRrθ. 
4Radar Functions • Normal radar functions: 1. range (from pulse delay) 2. velocity (from Doppler frequency shift) 3. 
angular direction (from antenna pointing) • Signature analysis and inverse scattering: 4. target size (from magnitude of return)5. target shape and components (return as a function of  direction) 6. 
moving parts (modulation of the return) 7. material composition • The complexity (cost & size) of th e radar increases with the extent  of the functions that the radar performs.. 5Electromagnetic Spectrum Wavelength ( λ, in a vacuum and approximately in air) 10-3 10-210-1 11 0-510-410-3 10-210-1 11 01102 103104 105 109108107106105 104103 102 10 1 100 10 1 100 10 1 Frequency (f, cps, Hz)RadioMicrons Meters Giga Mega KiloMicrowave Millimeter Infrared Ultraviolet Visible Optical 300 MHz 300 GHzEHF SHF UHF VHF HF MF LF Typical radar  frequencies.

It is obtained by recording the round trip travel time of a pulse, TR,  and computing range from: where  c= 3x108m/s is the velocity of light in free space.

•The result is interference : constructive interference occurs if the waves  add; destructive interference occurs if the waves cancel. •Example: ground bounce multi-path can be misinterpreted as multiple  targets.Superposition of Waves th rh rdtdGrazing Angle,ψAirborne Radar Target. 13•Polarization refers to the shape of the curve traced by the tip of the  electric field vector as a function  of time at a point in space.

• Fundamental equation for gain: • In general, an increase in gain is accompanied by a decrease in  beamwidth, and is achieved by in creasing the antenna size relative  to the wavelength. • With regard to radar, high gain and narrow beams are desirable for  long detection and tracking ranges and accurate direction measurement.24/ , effective area   = aperture area  efficiency (0 1) /,  w a v e l e n g t he eGA AA A cfπλε εελ= = =≤ ≤ =Low gain                   High gain (Small in wavelengths)       (Large in wavelengths) ANTENNA DIRECTIONAL   RADIATION PATTERNAperture area. 15•Half power beamwidth, HPBW (θB)  • Polarization • Sidelobe level  • Antenna noise temperature ( TA)  • Operating bandwidth  • Radar cross section and other signaturesAntenna Parameters 0MAXIMUM  SIDELOBE   LEVELPEAK GAINGAIN (dB)θsPATTERN ANGLEθSCAN  ANGLE HPBW3 dB 0MAXIMUM  SIDELOBE   LEVELPEAK GAINGAIN (dB)θsPATTERN ANGLEθSCAN  ANGLE HPBW3 dB Rectangular dB pattern plot G 0.5G G 0.5G Polar voltage pattern plot.

(Similar  to Figure 1.4 in Skolnik.) • Coherent radar uses the same local oscill ator reference for transmit and receive. 
. 20Coordinate Systems • Radar coordinate systems spherical polar: ( r,θ,φ) azimuth/elevation: (Az,El)  or  • The radar is located at the origin of  the coordinate system; the Earth's surface lies in the  x-yplane.   • Azimuth (α) is generally measured  clockwise from a reference (like a  compass) but the spherical system  azimuth angle (φ )is measured  counterclockwise from the xaxis.

Over a range of frequencies of bandwidth Bn(Hz) the available noise  power is  where                              (Joules/K) is Boltzman's constant. • Other radar components will also contribute noise (antenna, mixer,  cables, etc.).

 Ideally there  should be no overlap in sub-ba nd frequency characteristics. • The noise bandwidth of the Doppler filte rs is small compared to that of the  radar’s total bandwidth, which improves the SNR.   • Velocity estimates can be made by mon itoring the power out of each filter.
