Radar System Engineering  Chapter 1 – History of Radar Technology  1     1 The History of Radar Technology   Much has been composed on the history of Radar technology, particularly since it is possible to  find sections about it in almost every book on the theme of Radars. 
 With some reservation one  can say that Radar technology became 100 years old in 1988.  It was Heinrich Hertz, who with  his underlying and groundbreaking Experiments in 1887/88 was able to demonstrate for electr o- magnetic waves, that they are reflected by metals and dielectric objects.  The above reservation is  appropriate beca use Heinrich Hertz truly determined an effect of the reflection, but whose appl i- cation thereof was not further considered. 
 At the beginnings of Radar technology the break- through of this field of engineering was not successful and quick.  One must even mod estly state,  that apart from a few exceptions, Radar was ignored for almost over 40 years.   After Heinrich Hertz, it was first the German engineer, Christian Hülsmeyer (1881 -1957), who  employed himself with the mentioned reflection effect and registered his patent in 1904 (shown in Figure 1.1). 
 The instrumentation was introduced on the I nternational Navigation Association  in Rotterdam, but nevertheless interest in the technology failed to appear.  They pursued their ideas for another few years without econo mic or financial success.  Discouraged by the lack of  interest, Hülsmeyer and his investor, Heinrich Mannheim, gave up a few years later. 
  The next person, who recognized the importance of the Radar effect, was Marconi.  As a young  man Marconi had exhaustiv ely pursued the work of Heinrich Hertz and had constructed his  communication experiments upon it.  In 1922 he gave a fiery speech before the Institute of Radio  Engineers (IRE) in London. 
 Several lines can be read in Figure 1.2.  Nevertheless not even he was in a position to awake enthusiasm and interest for Radar technology.   Beginning in 1922 successful Radar experiments with a wooden ship using 600  MHz were ca r- ried out by Tayler and Young of the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). 
 Their work was also  abandoned after a short while.   Then in the years 1925/26 Breit and Tuve conducted investigations on the earth’s Ionosphere.  From this time on the importance of Radar for Navigation, especially at sea, became increasingly recognized. 
 At the same time resear ch work became heavily promoted and supported in many  countries, like the USA, England, France and last, but not least, Germany.  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 1 – History of Radar Technology  2        Figure 1.1  Cover page of Hülsmeyer’s patent specification  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 1 – History of Radar Technology  3     As was first shown by Hertz, electric waves can be co mpletely ref lected by  conducting bodies. In some of my tests I have noticed the effects of reflection and  detection of these waves by metallic objects miles away. It seems to me that it  should be possible to design apparatus by means of which a ship could radiate or  project a divergent beam of these rays in any desired d irection, which rays, if  coming across a metallic object, such as another steamer or ship, would be  reflected back to a receiver screened from the local transmitter on the sending  ship, and thereby, imm ediately reveal the pre sence and bearing of the other ship  in fog or thick weather. 
  Figure 1.2  Section of the Marconi Speech in 1922 before the IRE   In Germany it was the GEMA (Gesellschaft für Elektrische und Mechanische Apparate), Pinsch,  and Telefunken, which became known for their work on Radar systems.  The first instruments were very simple and operated with relatively low frequencies.  The following lists a few impo r- tant dates:   1930 US NRL (L.A. 
Hyland) locates an airplane, 33 MHz, 2 Miles   1933 French Marine locates an Iceberg, 1800 MHz   1933 Pinsch locates a Ship, 0.3 W, 2200 MHz, 2 km   1934 GEMA locates a Ship 500 t, 150 MHz, 12 km   A large advancement in innovation brought the employment of pulsable Magnetrons 1 and the  Braun Cathode Ray Tube2, as the following data shows:  1935 In England Sir Watson Watt submitted a proposal for the Radar defense of  England. Already in 1937 five systems exist with a range of 100  km.  1936 Telefunken (preceeding Freya) locates Junkers W34, 60 km   1937 Telefunken, Freya, 125 MHz, 150 km (Figure 1.3)  1938 Patent for Fundamental of Pulse Radar Technology (US -  SC Col. 
William Blair)  USA, NRL XAF Ship Radar 200 MHz, 6 kW, 50 Miles.   Radar technology underwent rapid development during the years of the Second World War.  An exam ple for this is the founding of the Radiation Laboratory at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of  Technology). 
 Until 1945 there were 3000 engineers and scientists employed there.   Listed below are simply a few more important dates from Germany’s Radar developmen t:  1940 "Würzburg C", 200 MHz, 3 m ø, 4000 Unit   1941 "Würzburg Riese" 7,5 m ø, ±10', 1500 Unit (Figure 1.4)   1942 "Mannheim", 12 kW, automatic analysis   1942 "BordRadar Lichtenstein", 150 MHz, 15000 Unit   After the war year the development of Radar systems en tered a long pause.  Noteworthy ho w- ever, is that in 1946 the USA succeeded in reception of echoes from the Moon with a modified apparatus from the "Würzburg Riese" series. 
                                                    1 Varian brothers, Palo Alto, ca. 1935   2 Karl Ferdi nand Braun, 1850  – 1918, Braun Cathode Ray Tube 1896, Nobelpize 1909  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 1 – History of Radar Technology  4        Figure 1.3  Radar apparatus Freya, Telefunken 1937   Beginning at the end of the 50’ s Radar technology also saw increasing innovation in the comp o- nent and signal processing sectors. 
 In Radar receivers as well as in the signal analysis circuitry,  vacuum tubes were replaced by semiconductors. Despite these improvements the technological development of Radar technology was slower than in the consumer goods industry until the 70’s.  The reason can be seen from the very long development phases needed for larger systems, pa r- ticularly in the military field. 
 Often it happened that more than 10 y ears would pass from the  definitions phase until the deployment -ready apparatus would be realized.  Only after the 70’s did  Radar technology experience comparably rapid phase of development through the opening of  new fields of usage, as in the fields of se nsors and remote sensing.  .

Further relevant Literature on the history of Radar can be found in [4, 5, 11, 12].. Radar System Engineering  Chapter 2 – EM Field Theory and Wave Propagation  7     2 Electromagnetic field theory & wave propag a- tion basics  Through the analysis of the fundamental procedures of Radar technology one can no rmally a s- sume that the transmitter/receiver and the target object are in the mutual far -field. 
 This makes the  inspection of plane waves at the equipment site (e.g. antenna) and the reflec ting objects according  to Figure 2.1 possible.     Figure 2.1  Diagram of the basic function of Radar: sent signal, reflected signal from object,  multipath spreading, ground r eflection. 
  The essence of Radar technology lies in the use of a wave reflected by an object.   Important for the performance are:    Frequency   Polarization    Target properties    Equipment performance    Intervisibility (how well equipment and object can “see“ one ano ther)   Distance   Below the theoretical constraints for the reflection of plane waves on metallic and diele ctric bo d- ies will be shown.  Quantitative analysis will follow later. 
  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 2 – EM Field Theory and Wave Propagation  8     2.1 Fields and Waves in Free Space  The foundation of all wave behaviour is described by Maxwell’s Equations:      € rot  H =∂  D  ∂t+  j  (2.1)     € rot  E =−∂  B  ∂t (2.2)     € div  B =0 (2.3)     € div  D =ρ (2.4)  The solutions of these equations are so varied that general and task specific restrictions must be  made and boun dary conditions are defined.   Restrictions:   Time- harmonic processes:   € e(t)=E⋅ejωt (2.5)  € ∂ ∂t=jω (2.6)  Charge density of free space:  € ρ=0 (2.7)  Current in free space:      €   i =0 (2.8)  Homogeneous and isotropic field densities:      €   D =ε  E =ε0εr  E  (2.9)     €   B =µ  H =µ0µr  H  (2.10)  € c=1 µε=c0 µrεr (2.11)  Spreading of the field in the z -direction:      €  e (x,y,z,t)=Re  E (x,y)⋅ { eγz+jωt} (2.12a)     €   h (x,y,z,t)=Re  H (x,y)⋅ { eγz+jωt} (2.12b)  € y=α+jβ   € ∂ ∂z=y≈jβ(lossless ) (2.13b)  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 2 – EM Field Theory and Wave Propagation  9     From Maxwell’s equations it follows that all cartesian components of the field in a h omogenous,  isotropic, charge and current free medium (grad  ε = 0, grad µ = 0) and namely the instantaneous  values satisfy the Wave Equation:   € ΔA=1 c2∂2A ∂t2 (2.14)  The free -space propagation in the far field of the antenna is described by plane waves with the  Poynting vector    €   S =  E ×  H .  € E and  € H are in phase and they lie perpendicular  to each other.   Of interest for Radar technology is the position of the field components  € E and  € Hregarding the  media, on which they impinge. 
One distinguishes the wave by the position of the ele ctrical field  components based upon the direction of propagation and spreading. Should  € E and  € S stretch in a  vertical plane, this is vertical polarization.  Should they stretch in a hor izontal plane, this is hor i- zontal polarization. 
  2.2 Reflection on Perfect Conducting Bodies   The behaviour of reflecting objects is demonstrated on perfect conducting bodies. On conducting  bodies certain field conditions are enforced, which are signified as boundary cond itions:  - Upon perfect conducting surfaces there can exist no tangential electrical field strengths:   € Etan≡0 (1.15)  - For frequencies in the microwave range there exists an extreme Skin Effect and consequently  the penetration depths of all fields disappear.  Therefore only tan gential magnetic field comp o- nents appear on conducting surfaces. 
  € Hnorm≡0 (2.16)  - Due to the consistency of the electric field Maxwell’s equations yield the following:   € ∂Htan ∂n=0 (2.17)   Where ∂/∂n demonstrates an identified existing tangential field Htan from the derivation  according to measuring standards. In Figure 2.2 the boundary conditions for the time independent  components are illustrated.   Σetan=etaninc+etanref=0 ∂htan/∂n=0 etaninc etanrefΣhnorm=hnorminc+hnormref=0 hnorminchnormref   Figure 2.2  Boundary conditions on a perfectly conducting surface (inc = incident, ref =  reflected)  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 2 – EM Field Theory and Wave Propagation  10     These boundary conditions lead to total reflection with a shift in phase (r = -1) of the electroma g- netic waves of a perfect conducting body.  The direction of the reflection depends upon the inc i- dent angle and the geometry of the body. Complex bodies show a more complex reflection char- acteristic. 
  2.3 Reflection on Dielectric Interfaces   In Radar technology, in addition to metallic objects like airplanes, dielectric objects are also of  interest.  Examples are the Earth’s surface, plants, water, etc.  The waves penetrate, as will be  shown, into the dielectric. 
 There are losses of the dielectric (e.g. water, where the penetrating  waves quickly dissipate), whereby this attenuation due to losses is proportional to  the frequency  and the loss angle of the material.   When a wave from free space, as in Figure 2.3, encounters a infinitely extended dielectric surface  with relative permittivity εr, then a coherent wave is dispersed in the entire, which has varying  characteristics in the two subsections and whose electrical field lines experience a break when crossing the interface, if the field line does not arise perpendicularly. 
 With linear po larization,  the polarization is defined by the situation of the electrical field vector in the incident plane.     Figure 2.3  Polarization defined incident Waves. (a) Parallel Polarization (b) Perpendicular  Polarization   The electric field can show a tangent ial component E 1tan and a perpendicular component E 1norm   in regard to the interface. 
 In the dielectric exist the corresponding components E 2tan  and E 2norm .   The following applies for the instantaneous values at the interface:   € e1tan=e2tan,  € e1norm=εr⋅e2norm (2.18)   The tangential electric field strengths are constant at the interface and the orthogonal electric field  strengths undergo a shift or “jump” in the transition at the interface.  When the dielectric is void of magnetic effects (t hus µ r = 1), the magnetic field strengths pass unchanged through the inte r- face. 
The following applies for the instantaneous values:   € h1tan=h2tan,  € h1norm=h2norm (2.19) . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 2 – EM Field Theory and Wave Propagation  11     Figure 2.4 shows the boundary conditions in diagrammatic form.

  With help from these boundary conditions (2.18) and (2.19) can yield the effects and/or the infl u- ences of the dielectrics and, in particular, the characteristics of the reflected waves [14].  Below  the co mplex reflection coefficients for E -Waves and H -Waves are arranged according to how  they impinge upon the expanded dielectric surfaces.  The wave originates from medium 1 and  encounters medium 2.

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 3 – The Radar Equation  13     3 The Radar Equation  3.1 Radar Equation for Point Targets   The general Radar equation found in Literature is derived for point targets. Point targets a re ob- jects whose dimensions D are small compared to the illumination R*  γBW (Range*Half -power  beamwidth) by the Radar at the target site. 
This is illustrated in Figure 3.1.   Target Transmit Antenna  GainGT Receive Antenna GainGRσRadar Transmit PowerPT Receive Pow er PRD Radar Cross Section σR∗γBWGT GRPTPR   Figure 3.1  Illustration of the principle of Radar.   For better understanding the Rad ar equation will be progressively derived in this section. 
  Peripheral effects and environmental influences, as well as sensitivity, will be dealt with later.    On the sender -side of the Radar a power PT will be radiated.  With a range R from the transmitte r  a power density at the target St results from isotropic (spherical) radiation   € St=PT 4πR2 (3.1)  This is the power density of an omni -directional antenna with a range R. 
Since in Radar techno l- ogy one, almost exclusively, directs the radiation, the power density at the range R increases with  the antenna gain GT:  € St=PT⋅GT 4πR2 (3.2)  The following can be considered: The transmitting antenna gain GT relates only to the maximum  of the antenna main lobe. Consequently, GT indicates the increase of the power density at a di s- tance R through Radar antennas based upon isotropic emitters with the same sending power. G  comprises the antenna losses and is calculated with the directivity D and the a ntenna efficiency η:  € G=η⋅D (3.3) . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 3 – The Radar Equation  14     The impinging radiated power is scatted by the target object and is dependent on shape, size, m a- terial or orientation of the object.  The measure of scattered power in d irection of the Radar is the  scattering cross section σ/m2 of the object.  With this, from the target to the transmitter the power  Pt is scattered. 
  € Pt=St⋅σ=PT⋅GT 4πR2⋅σ (3.4)   At the location of the transmitter/receiver antenna the scatter power Pt generates the power de n- sity SR.   € SR=Pt 4πR2=PT⋅GT⋅σ 4πR2( )2 (3.5)  The receiving antenna has an e ffective area AR, and it absorbs the power out of the power density  SR.  € PR=SRAR=PTGTσAR 4πR2( )2 (3.6)   The effective area AR is also used in direct relationship to the gain G [9]. 
  € G=4πAR λ2 (3.7)  This then yields:   € PR=PT⋅GT⋅GR⋅λ2 4π()3⋅R4⋅σ=PT⋅AT⋅AR 4πλ2⋅R4⋅σ (3.8)   Under the assumption that a postulated signal -to-noise ratio S/N gives the received power PRmin,  one obtains the maximum range of coverage Rmax.  € Rmax=PT⋅ATAR 4πλ2PRmin⋅σ 4 =PT⋅GTGRλ2 4π()3PRmin⋅σ 4  (3.9)  € PRmin= minimum received power (see section “Noise and Detectio n“)  The dependence of the transmitted power PT and the Radar cross- section σ is proportional by  (  4) the 4th root.  The dependence of the wavelength is essentially more complicated since the  scattering cross section can be heavily frequency dependent. 
 Furthermore in GT, the frequency  over the effective area of the antenna is cont ained quadratically.  Consequently, for the estimation  of the frequency dependence of the range of coverage, the influence of frequency on the follo w- ing characteristics must be considered:    Antenna gain    Propagation attenuation    Cross- section of the reflectio n . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 3 – The Radar Equation  15      3.2 Radar Equation for Extended Targets   For extended targets, meaning targets that are located in the far field,  € Rmax is proportional  € 2  to € 4, depending on the distance and characteristics of the t arget. 
 An example of a flat, two - dimensional target with an extension D  >> R*ΘH will be shown by Figure 3.2 on the basis of   geometric optics.     Figure 3.2  Reflection on a flat, extended target.   The mirrored reflection is in relation to a “virtual” sourc e from a distance R behind the target. 
  The power density at the receiver then becomes:   € SR=PT⋅GT 4π2R()2 (3.10)  From this follow the received power PR  € PR=SRAR=PTGTGR⋅λ2 4⋅4π()2⋅R2 (3.11)  And the range of coverage is yielded by   € Rmax=PTGTGR⋅λ2 PRmin4⋅4π()2 (3.12)  For extended concave targets (e.g. Parabolic)  will be ~ p with p <  2 (focused) and for extended  targets with Rmax ~ p and p  > 2 (unfocussed).  The assumption is in all cases that the reflection  over the entire surface area of the extended object is well correlated, meaning, for example, that  no scattering appears. 
 Such “smooth” surfaces can be, for example, the sides of trucks of the  extended hulls of ships. Radar System Engineering  Chapter 3 – The Radar Equation  16     3.3 The Radar Horizon   The range of coverage of Radar equipment can be limited due to minimum received power PRmin  and as well due to the visibility (i.e. the Radar horizon). 
 The Radar horizon is given by the  Earth’s curvature and the height of the Radar equipment & the target object, as shown in Figure  3.3.    Figu re 3.3  Location determination of an object under the horizon (RE = Earth’s radius)   Considering the geometry & optics, the following estimation for the range of coverage is yielded  by:  € Rgeom=R1+R2=(hT+RE)2−RE2+(h0+RE)2−RE2 ≈2hTRE+2h0RE=2RE⋅hT+h0 ( ) (3.13)  This estimation is derived under the fol lowing requirements:   -  € RE>>hT,h0  - Earth is flat and void of various elevations   - Refraction of the electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere is neglected   This estimation of the neglect of the refraction leads to an under -estimation of the rang e of cover- age.  While passing through atmosphere (expected to be thinner at each higher elevation) the  wave will be refracted towards the Earth as demonstrated in Figure 3.4. 
    Figure 3.4  Refraction of waves in the inhomogeneous atmosphere and the enlargem ent of the  range of coverage.   . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 3 – The Radar Equation  17     Through this bending, as it is taken into account in physical optics, the visibility & view under  the horizon with be expanded. 
 The ray path is bent to the Earth.  A correction factor k is used in  the calculation of the rang e of coverage.  € Rphys=Rgeom k=2kRE(hT+h0) (3.14)  For a linear running refractive index profile, k follows as:  € k=1 1+RE⋅dn dh (3.15)  Here  € dndh indicates the differential change of the refractive index n with height/altitude h. 
 For  the standard atmoshphere  € dndh≈−40⋅10−6/km and for the correction factor:   € k≈1,34=4/3 (3.16)  One speaks of a 4/3 Earth radius.  With that the range of coverage is enlarged by approximately  15.7%.  3.4 Bistatic Radar Equation   In the previously derived Radar equation it presupposes that transmitters and receivers  are at the  same place (i.e. 
the Radar is monostastic).  There are, however, many reasons for transmitters and receivers to be separate spatially:   Reduction of the antenna coupling in or der to measure the smallest of signals   Use of a single transmitter for several receivers   Use of other or foreign transmitters (transmitter of opportunity)   Protection of the receiver from discovery (and possible destruction)   Protection of the receiver from electrical interference (electronic warfare)   In all cases there is a reference for the receiver and, as a rule, a direct connection the to transmi t- ter is required, as demonstrated in Figure 3.5.   transmitter receiver targetreceiver reference signal scattered signalscattered signalreference signal RT RRRR   Figure 3.5  Bistatic Radar scenario: Satellite as the sender  and 2 receivers. 
 . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 3 – The Radar Equation  18     The derivation of the Radar equation for bistatic Radar is as with monostatic Radar. Simply the  grouping of terms is different. 
 € PR=PTGT⋅1 4πRT2⋅σB⋅1 4πRR2⋅λ2 4πGR =PT⋅GTGRλ2 (4π)3RT2RR2σB (3.17)  Here meaning:   € PR=receiver power   € PT=transmitter power   € RT=distancefrom thetransmitter tothetarget  € RR=distancefrom thereceiver tothetarget   € σB=bistatic radar cross−section ofthetarget  € GT=transmitter gain   € GR=receiver gain   For the analysis of the receiver signal the direct, coherent reception of the transmitter signal ( il- luminator) is necessary.  From the propagation time and the directions the Radar picture is gener- ated with relatively elaborate trigonometry.   Of interest is particularly the use of available transmitters (e.g. 
TV satellites as illuminators).  Development in this direction is strongly enforced and not only in the military.  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 4 – Information Content of Radar Signals  19     4 Information Content in Radar Signals   In the section for the Radar Equation the realizable information content of Radar was implicitly  demonstrated.  Depending on the principle that is put to use, the following information can be o b- tained from a Radar signal and/or a series of signals:   Distance or Range  € R,  Velocity and/or Speed (change in distance over time) € dR dt,  Azimuth ψ, change of the Azimuth over time  € dψ dt  Elevation ϑ, change i n elevation over time  € dϑ dt  Size of the target  € s,  Shape of the target € dσ dψ,  Polarization of the target  € svv &  € shh,  Signature (information about the target) [ σ].  The most important and most often evaluated information would be:   Distance or Range,   Velocity and/or Speed,   Direction. 
  In the following their determination and analysis will be discussed as well as procedures for their  measurement to be shown.   4.1 Range   The range is measured as the time difference between the echo -signal and a corresponding refe r- ence.  As a reference the transmission signal is normally marked and the timestamp between is  saved at the receiver. 
 The range can be calculated from the duration ∆t and the speed of propagation  co:  € c0⋅Δt=2R⇒R=c0⋅Δt 2 (4.1)   For very precise range measurements the genuine speed of propagation (influenced by air pressure,  moisture, etc.) is to be used instead of co.  The resolution in the range depends on the time steps of  the timer (e.g. 1 ns = 30 cm). 
 . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 4 – Information Content of Radar Signals  20     Three magnitudes are used for resolving the timestamp, as is shown in Figure 4.1:   - Amplitude A  → Pulse Modulation   → Pulse Radar  - Frequency f  → Frequency Modulation  → FM- CW Radar   - Phase ϕ   → Phase Modulation  → Phase Interferometer     Figure 4.1  Procedure to measure range: T = Period duration, B = Frequency shift, Δf  =  frequency difference, Δt time difference, τ = Pulse duration.   With pulse Radar the time difference can be measured directly. 
 With FM -CW Radar the duration  will be determined from the difference in frequency as received from the target and of the current  transmitter.  For the simple case of linear frequency modulation, referring to Figure 4.1, ∆ t is as fo l- lows:  € Δt=ΔfT B⇒R=ΔfT 2Boc (4.2)  Along with the analysis of the frequency difference ∆ f, with FM -CW Radar the range to reflecting  objects can also be calculated from a Fourier transform of the complex frequency signal in the time  domain.   The unambiguous range of coverage is limited by th e pulse repetition frequency PRF  = 1/Τ of the  selection. 
 For the repetition period Τ follows the unambiguous range of coverage:   € unamR=c0⋅T 2=c0 2PRF (4.3)  The resolution, meaning the distance separation of two targets, is in all case inversely proportiona l  to the bandwidth B, which will be employed. As a good approximation the following can be applied:   BcR2min> Δ  (4.4)  In the last few years several Super-Resolution Algorithms , as ESPRIT, have been developed, with  which the resolution under cer tain conditions can be considerably improved.  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 4 – Information Content of Radar Signals  21     4.2 Velocity   In the case of continuous observation of the target (CW Radar) its radial velocity produces a phase  shift of the received signal, known as Doppler effect, from which follows:  € ωd=dϕ dt (4.5)  € fd=ωd 2π=1 2πdϕ dt=−2 λ0dr dt=−2vr λ0=−2vrf0 c0 (4.6)  € fd=Doppler frequency    € vr=radial velocity    € f0,λ0=transmission frequenncy ,wavelength   € c0=propagation velocity    As a rule  € fdHz[]=55,5⋅vkm /h[ ]λcm[].  With a movement diagonally for the direction of prop a- gation of the wave only the radial  component from v is to be considered vr.  The Doppler effect is  clear with CW Radar devices, in contrast to the coherent pulse Radar. 
 With this the ambiguity d e- velops if the phase shift through Doppler in a pulse interval becomes larger than 2 π.  With the non- coherent pulse Radar, i.e. no phase reference from pulse to pulse, the radial velocity is measured  over the change of distance, however substantially more inaccurately. 
 The coherent procedures r e- quire a good short -time stability of the tr ansmission signals (see pulse Radar, chapter 8).   4.3 Direction (Azimuth, Elevation)   Antennas generate a plane wave in the far field.  They also mainly receive the plane wave from the  far field, which corresponds to the alignment of the antenna. 
The target dire ction therefore can be  determined from the antenna position.  This does apply, however, only so long, as on the propag a- tion path no deviations from straight rays by inhomogeneities arise ( Duct).  The attainable accuracy  depends on the half power beam -width of the antenna characteristic. 
 Another procedure for the  measurement of direction uses several receiving antennas, at which the phase difference of the r e- ceived signal is used for the direction finding.  Examples are mono -pulse Radar (section 11,1,1) and   interferometers, as used in astronomy.   4.4 Polarization Characteristics of the Target   The polarization of a target is rarely considered. 
 However, it offers the possibility of determining and/or of differentiating between structures.  As an example, vegetatio n (trees, plants, etc.) normally  reflects with vertical polarization substantially more strongly than with horizontal polarization, since  vegetation is usually aligned vertically. However, de -polarization on the propagation path represents  a problem (there fore the use of polarization diversity with communications satellites). 
 The choice of  the correct polarization offers, among other advantages, the possibility of suppressing disturbances  (weather).  Thus precipitation disturbs less with circular polarizat ion.  The knowledge around the  evaluation of polarization characteristics is called Radar polarimetry. 
   . Radar Systems Engineering  Chapter 5 – Resolution and Accuracy  23     5 Resolution and Accuracy   Resolution is a measurement for how close or dense targets may be to each other, while still b e- ing able to separately detect th em.  Under the term resolution the ability is therefore understood  for the separation of neighbouring objects. 
 Accuracy is a measure for how large the tolerances  for the determination of the info rmation parameters, such as distance, speed, etc. are.  The accu- racy describes thus, with which relative or absolute errors the measured variable can be dete r- mined. 
 Measurement uncertainty result from:   - Imprecise measurement equipment   - Quantization errors   - Noise  - Signal distortion.   For an example a sine wave o scillation with be analyzed.   5.1 Measurement Accuracy and Sine Wave Oscill ations   As shown in Figure 5.1, when one observes a sine wave, with superimposed noise n(t), so differs  the observed amplitude from the true amplitude around  € ΔU=n(t)  € u(t)=U0sin(ωt+ϕ0)+n(t) (5.1)    Figure 5.1  Sine wave oscillation with superimposed noise.

    Figure 5.2  Video pulse and added noise with edge trigg ering.    . Radar Systems Engineering  Chapter 5 – Resolution and Accuracy  25     The calculation of Δtr is performed similar to equation (5.5)   € Δtr=tr U02n2=tr 2SN (5.10)   tr is the linear rise time from 10% up to 90% of U0. 
Δtr is the measurement accuracy for the edge  triggering.  With that yields the range accuracy:   € ΔR=c0⋅Δtr/2 (5.11)  The other equations from above can be applied in analogous way.   5.3 Range Resolution of Two Neighbouring Targets   By the term resolution it is understood the differentiation of targets, which are in very close pro x- imity to on another, as shown in Figure 5.3     Figu re 5.3  Echoes of two neighbouring objects. 
  u1(t) indicates the echo of target 1 and u 2(t) the echo of target 2. Then for resolution optimization  the integral must become a maximum.   € (u1(t)−u2(t)) ∫2dt= u12(t)−2u1(t)u2(t)+u22(t) [ ] ∫ dt (5.12)  The integral will become a maximum when the  negative part becomes minimum, thus   € u1(t)u2(t)=minimum ∫ (5.13)  Assuming that both signals result from the same or similar shape (same reflection cross section)  then their transit times being t 1 & t 2 yield on the left side of the equation (5.13):   € u(t−t1)u(t−t2) ∫  (5.14)  This integral represents the auto -correlation function of the signal with itself. 
 For optimizing the  resolution, the shape of the pulse should be optimized.  The ideal result would be:   € =0für t1≠t2 ∫ ;=1für t1=t2 ∫  (5.15)  If the targets are different in size, then one should bear equation (5.14) in mind. The auto - correlation will then become a cross -correlation. 
 . Radar Systems Engineering  Chapter 5 – Resolution and Accuracy  26     With typical specifications of the threshold value for the cross -correlation, the range resolution  ΔR can be approximately ca lculated as illustrated in Figure 5.4   € ΔR=c0⋅τ/2 (5.16)    Figure 5.4  Range resolution of two targets.     Figure 5.5  Example for the ability to resolve objects at differing ranges & separation distances. 
  5.4 Angular Resolution   The angular resolut ion can be calculated in a similar way as the range resolution, if pulse echoes  are replaced with the maximum of the directivity.  As a good approximation the half -power  beamwidth   γBWof the antenna can be utilized.  This is illustrated in Figure 5.6.

          . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 6 – Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection  28     6 Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection   The maximum range of coverage has been determined in Chapter 3 with the min imum receiv- ing power € PRmin.  This will again be determined with the required signal -to-noise ratio S/N and  the noise  € PN power at the receiver input. 
  The fundamental contributions to P N yield:   thermal noise   cosmic noise   atmospheric absorption noise   Man made noise.   In the following section the system inherent noise contribution and the contributions of the  communication path with be dealt with.   6.1 Thermal Noise   The thermal (ohmic) noise is inherent to the system and is determined b y the temperature and  the bandwidth. 
 The theories of noisy dipoles and quadripoles are to be found in [10]. The thermal noise power  € PN results from:  € PN=NT⋅BN=k⋅T⋅BN (6.1)  € k=1,38⋅10−23J°KBoltzmann 'scons tant  € BN = Noise  bandwidth of the receiver (3dB bandwidth)   € NT = Noise power density   For  € T=300°K:  € NT=−114dBm /MHz bandwidth  (6.1a)  In practice the thermal noise will be increased due to flicker and spot noise of the receiver i n- put stages.  This increase will be indicated as the noise figure NF. 
  If the output noise power of the receiver amounts to N A and if the total gain is G, then we have  the following:  GkTBN GNNNFA TA ⋅=⋅=  (6.2) . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 6 – Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection  29         Figure 6.1  Noise measurement (dB) of various recei ver input stages   The gain is able to be expressed as a quotient of the signal power at the output P A and input P E  of the receiver.   € G=PA PE=PAmin PEmin (6.3)  The minimum receiver input power is calculated with equation (6.4):   € PRmin=NF⋅kTBPA NA=NF⋅kTBN(S/N)=NF⋅NT(S/N) (6.4)  S/N is the required Signal -to-Noise ratio for further analysis. 
 6.2 Cosmic and Background Noise   Broadband noise comes from outer space in the form of plane waves.  The antennas then a l- ways receive this noise if the directivity of the main or side lobes poi nts to outer space.  The  noise results from our galaxy, the Milky Way, other galaxies, “Radio Stars and Clusters”, and  from the Sun.

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 6 – Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection  30     The antenna noise temperature TAnt, which takes these noise contributions into consideration,  can be calculated, with help from (6.5), by the convolution of the background temperature TB  with the squared directivity  € C(θ,ϕ).  Figure 6.2 shows the convolution.

In the first case, only a slight variation of the bac k- ground temperature TB for varying  € θ und  € ψ in the main beam of the antenna is assumed. 
  Then T B can be taken as a constant factor for the integral in equation (6.5).    The remaining integral can be calculated with equation (6.7), with the acceptance of a high  degree of efficiency  € (G≈D), and with the utilization of equation (6.6):   € G=4π C2(θ,ψ)dΩ 4π∫ (6.6)  € AntT=GBT 4πC2(θ,ψ)dΩ 4π∫ = BT (6.7)  The noise of extended sources can be described by the brightness  € BC.  The brightness  € BC is  defined as the noise power, which is received per unit of area  € (m2), per bandwidth  € (Hz), and  per solid angle  € ΩB(rad ). 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 6 – Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection  31        Figure 6.3  Noise temperature of outer space Tc in Kelvin (cosmic temperature,  extended noise sources) seen from the earth for linear polarization, as well  as the temperature of the atmospheric absorption noise Ta.  The brightness B c is associated with the noise temperature TB by the Rayleigh -Jeans Formula:   € Bc=2kTB λ2W m2HzSteradian (6.8)  The second special case demonstrates a semi -discrete noise source of the temperature in a na r- row area of the solid angle ΩB.  The background radiation is to be neglected. 
 The equivalent  solid angle of the antenna ΩAnt = 4 π/G is >> ΩB.  By aligning the antenna to the noise source,  the antenna noise temperature TAnt can be calculated within good a approximation according to  equation (6.9):  € TAnt=TBΩB ΩAnt (6.9)  An example for such a discrete noise source is the sun  € ΩH=6,5⋅10−5(sr) (solid angle in st e- radian).  The noise temperature of the sun lies in the frequency range from 2GHz at approx i- mately € 10000°K. 
 With  € ΩAnt=0,08sr(from 22dBi) the antenna noise temperature results in  € TAnt=8,2°K. Higher antenna noise temperature values TAnt result from higher antenna gains.  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 6 – Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection  32     For the Sun and the Moon the aspect angles from the Earth are approxim ately 1/2 ° each.  Fig- ure 6.3 shows the Sun, Moon, and Cassiopeia.    Figure 6.4  Noise from radio stars and bodies: Sun, Moon, and Cassiopeia. 
  The first case is for that reason the most interesting.  When aligning the antenna to the sky, the  resulting noise temperature is TAnt ≈ 40°K due to the cosmic background noise.  When aligning  the antenna along the Earth (in the direction of the horizon) the resulting noise temperature is around 200°K, i.e., the average from the “warm” Earth and the “cold” sky. 
  6.3 Atmospheric Absorption Nois e  In a stationary condition all bodies, which absorb energy, re- radiate the same energy as noise  power.  This is the radiation theory of black bodies.  Would this not be the case then some  objects would warm themselves and others would cool themselves down . 
 The transmitting  power of the Radar will partially be absorbed by the atmosphere and will be re -radiated as  noise.  With absorption noise as a function of the surrounding temperature of the atmosphere T u = 260°K and with the atmospheric attenuation L a, the effective noise temperature T a is as  follows:   € Ta=Tu(La−1);where Tu=260°K (6.7)  .

  Since the atmospheric noise rises with the attenuation, the maximum occurs for Earth - tangenti al radiation, the minimum for perpendicular radiation ( Θ = 90° in Figure 6.5).  The  atmospheric noise has a broad minimum between 1 and 10 GHz, within which the up -to-now  chosen frequencies for Radar instrumentation for Earth exploration from outer space have also  been defined. The two -way attenuation in the a tmosphere is illustrated with the incident angle  as a parameter in Figure 6.5. 
 From this the atmospheric absorption noise can be computed directly.   6.4 System Noise Temperature   When calculating the system noise temperature all noise contributions, which are fed into the  input stages of the antenna, must be considered according to power and without any phase  correlation.  Generally the contributions for system noise temperature can be divided into three groups: . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 6 – Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection  34     Cosmic noise and atmospheric absorption noise,   Increase of the noise figure due to losses and attenuation of the input systems  (antenna, waveguide, switch, circulator, etc.),   Effective noise temperature of the receiver (amplifier, mixer, etc.).   Figure 6.6 shows the individual contributions with their iden tifiers.      Figure 6.6  Contributions of system noise temperature     The noise temperature is calculated exactly as the noise figure as a contribution of the indivi d- ual stages divided by the product of the gains G i of all preceding stages i. 
     € Tges=T1+T2 G1+T3 G1G2++TN G1G2Gn−1 (6.10)  Here it is assumed that the respective entrance reflection factors are negligible.       € T1=TAntT2=TaT3=TRFT4=TE G1=1G2=1/LaG3=1/LRFG4=V  With the identifiers from Figure 6.6 the following is obtained:     € Ttotal=TAnt+Ta+TRFLa+TELRFLa (6.11)  The noise bandwidth  € BN for white noise is not identical to the 3 dB bandwidth of the in - between frequency filters (IF bandwidth)  € BIF.  It can be calculated from,   . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 6 – Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection  35     € BN=H(f)2df −∞∞ ∫ H(f0)2 (6.12)  € H(f)=IFfrequency channel  &  € H(f0)=max oftheIFfilter curve .  In  € BN it is considered that the noise through the HF and IF circuitry (especially the filter) will  be weighted according to the frequency.  Only for rectangular filters is B N identical to the IF  bandwidth B IF. 
 From the noise temperature  € Ttotal, one obtains the noise power:   € Ntotal=k⋅Ttotal⋅BN (6.13)  6.5 False Alarm Rate and Probability of Detection   Since the received of a Radar signal is always distorted by noise, for the detection of Radar  targets one can only make a compro mise between a “false alarm rate” and the probability of  detection. Crucial are the specifications of a detection threshold (figure 6.7), which are co m- pared to the measured signal and it is determined whether the signal is to be interpreted as noise or as a target.  The optimal threshold must be determined dependent upon the respective  application. 
 For example, a high threshold value leads to a small “false alarm rate”, however,  at the same time leads to a reduced probability of detection.     Figure 6.7  “False alarm rate” dependent upon the position of the detection threshold.   If one would like to obtain quantitative predictions dependent upon the threshold and upon the  noise power density, then generally the probability density p(UN) of the noise voltage UN is  .

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 6 – Radar Receiver Noise and Target Detection  38     6.6 Radar Detectors   In practice essentially tw o detector procedures are used, the envelope detector and the I/Q d e- tector. 
 The advantages of the envelope detector, illustrated in Figure 6.11, whose central ele- ment can, for example, exhibit a linear, a square or a logarithmic characteristic, lie in it’ s sim- ple feasibility.     Figure 6.11  Receiver stages of a Radar with envelope detector.     By these simple detectors only the amplitude is preserved , the phase information is destroyed. 
 The bandwidth of the video signal is Bv = BIF/2  However, for this simplicity the phase information is destroyed if the Radar signal was cohe r- ent before. For coherent systems therefore the I/Q detector, shown in Figure 6.12, is available  (see section 7.1.2).       .

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 7 – CW and FM -CW Radar  41     7 CW- and FM-CW Radar   The CW ( continuous wave) Radar continuously radiates with the power PT. 
 A reflective o b- ject leads to a receiving power PR at the Radar.  The rel ationship PR/PT amounts up to 10-20.   The small receiving signal becomes overlapped by the transmitting signal. 
 The separation of  transmitting and receiving antenna (a bistatic construction) yields to an insufficient uncoupling (e.g. 80 dB).  3 procedures have been developed, through which CW Radar can become opera- tional:   - Measurement of the frequency modulation due to the Doppler Shift. 
  ⇒ CW Doppler Radar, only moving targets,   - Measurement of the phase shift of the receiving signal.   ⇒ Interferometry  - Frequency modul ation of the transmitting signal.   ⇒ FM CW Radar. 
 7.1 CW Doppler Radar   7.1.1  The Doppler Frequency   The Doppler effect is caused by a relative movement between Radar and reflecting objects,  identical to acoustics when there is a velocity difference between hearer and  the sound source  (police car).  The Doppler Frequency ωD is calculated from:   Dω=2πDf=dΘ dt=2π λdr dt=4πrv λ (7.1)  Df=r2v λ≈55,5•rv(km /h) λ(cm)(Hz)  (7.2a)  Df=T1,85f(GHz )rv(km /h)(Hz) (7.2b)  where  € λ is the wavelength and  € vr is the radial ve locity.  Figure 7.1 shows a simple CW Radar  schematic. 
 One obtains the baseband around the zero frequency directly by mixing the osci l- lator and receiving signal. The lower frequency limit is critical with this method, since it d e- termines the smallest meas urable velocity.  Additionally, the baseband is influenced by the  FM noise of the oscillator and by the sensitivity to spot & flicker noise. 
     . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 7 – CW and FM -CW Radar  42     Figure 7.1  Block circuit diagram of a simple CW Radar.     The mixture on an IF Band in MHz range gives some relie f, since the NF noise of the sem i- conductors approximately decreases by 1/f.

  7.1.2  Quadrature Modulation   Through the application of two mixers, which is practiced in quadrature modulation (phase  difference of 90° for the os cillator), the sign (+/ -) of the Doppler Frequency can be evaluated.   A quadrature demodulator (I/Q -Demodulator) determines the allocation of the receiving si g- nal, which is indicated with reference in -phase (I) or quadrature (Q) (meaning perpendicular),  as shown in Figure 7.4.  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 7 – CW and FM -CW Radar  43        Figure 7.4  Quadrature signal.     From this, the parameters follow:   € U0=I2+Q2 ϕ=arctanQ I f=dϕ 2πdt (7.3)  For a departing object  € fD is negative. The block diagram for a circuit for quadrature detection  is shown in Figure 7.5    Figure 7.5  Quadrature demodulator     One obtains the same result if the receiving signal is fed into the two mixers with a phase di f- ference of 90°. 
  7.1.3  Range Measurement with CW Radar   Range measurement with CW Radar is only possible over the range of th e uniqueness of the  signal (meaning the range λ/2), however, when in this range, quite exact.  Thus CW Radar is  suitably outstanding for position control and/or range measurement in automatic control eng i- neering.  As an example, the measurement of the wear of a brake disc of a passenger car is represented in Figure 7.6. 
 . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 7 – CW and FM -CW Radar  44        Figure 7.6  Distance measurement with CW Radar     The phase shift of the reflected wave received at the Radar amounts to:   00 0) (2222λπλπ ϕwear friction a a += =Δ  (7.4)  Here is the a0 initial setting.  The phase measurement with a precision of 3° to 5° is quite pos- sible. 
As an example, a sensor is regarded with 24 GHz, with which 5° correspond to the  change in phase of a of distance variation of approximately 40 µm.  Thus the wear due to fri c- tion can be controlled very exactly.   For the measurement of larger ranges and distances, an amplitude modulation (AM) can be  modulated on the CW signal and for the analysis, the phase of the AM can be determined. 
  The use of t wo or more sequential CW signals, with a frequency offset of Δf, is also possible  (stepped frequency CW Radar).  7.2 FM CW -Radar   The simple CW Radar in section 7.1 is not in the position to clearly measure a range > λ/2 to  an object, since referencing timestamps  of any kind are not present over the entire signal.   These timestamps can be generated through the frequency modulation of the transmitting si g- nal. 
 The result is FW CW Radar.   7.2.1  Range Measurement with FM CW Radar   In the early years of Radar technology simp le modulation processes were selected, such as  will be used for explanation and instruction in the following sections.  Today, with the use of synthesizers, nearly any frequency process is possible. 
 Figure 7.7 shows 3 examples.  .

                                                                           a Sawtooth modulation, b Triangular modulati on, c Sinusoidal modulation   The figure shows the transmitting signal in the upper lines, in the middle row the transmitting  and receiving signals, and on the bottom the difference from both.  The transmitting frequency is, as follows, time- dependent for the sawtooth modulation.   € fT=f0+Δf⋅t T (7.5)  For the symmetric triangular modulation results in:   € fT=f0+Δf⋅2t T (7.6)  In the following the sawtooth modulation will be further considered. 
 During the run time  € Δt=2Rc0 for the signal to the target and back, the transmitting frequency is altered corr e- sponding to  € Δt:  € fT=f0+Δf⋅t+Δt T (7.7)  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 7 – CW and FM -CW Radar  46     The mixing of the received signal with the current transmitting signal takes place in the Radar  receiver.  From t his the result is, among other things, the difference frequency  € fB, also known  as the “beat frequency”:   € fB=(f0+Δf⋅t+Δt T)−(f0+Δf⋅t T)=ΔfΔt T (7.8)  The range R follows from this:  € R=c0⋅fB 2Δf⋅T (7.9)  The beat frequency is proportional to th e target range R. 
 More complex frequency processes  can be calculated analogously.   7.2.2  Range Resolution with FM CW Radar   The measurement period  € tmeas and the utilized bandwidth Δf are crucial for the range resol u- tion.  For targets, for which  € Δt<<T applies, nearly the complete period is available for the  measurement:   € tmeas≈T (7.10)  Two targets with the ranges  € R1 and  € R2 have a difference in frequency of:  € ΔfB=fB1−fB2=2Δf c0T⋅R1−R2=2Δf c0T⋅ΔR (7.11)  From the measurement period T comes the minimum resolvable beat frequency  € fBmin=1/T. 
  Thus the result is the minimum range resolution:   € ΔfBmin=1 T=2Δf c0T⋅ΔRmin⇒ΔRmin=c0 2Δf (7.12)   This is inversely proportional to the bandwidth.  For this purpose, the target must be analyzed  throughout the entire frequency pass.  A reduction of the measurement period reduces the resolution. 
 In practice a degradation of nearly 30% can be expect ed:  € ΔRmin=1,3⋅c0 2Δf (7.13)  The maximum range  € Rmax determines the period duration.  The signal duration € Δt=2Rmax/c0  must be considerably smaller than the period  € T, since the resolution, as shown ab ove, will  otherwise not be reached:   € T>>2 c0⋅Rmax (7.14)  For the determination of the  € S/N, the proper bandwidth is the Radar bandwidth  € Δf.  The precision will be determined by the frequency counter for f B, the linearity of the pass, and  by the run- time errors in the Radar equipment & during the signal propagation. 
 The required  transmission powers are small because of the length of the analysis time.  FM CW Radar i n-. Radar System Engineering  Chapter 7 – CW and FM -CW Radar  47     strumentation is very often employed for th e altitude measurement of airplanes, helicopters,  and balloons. 
 In recent years they have also dominated the automobile Radar sensors market.   A superimposed Doppler signal  € fD increases the IF -frequency (beat frequency)  € fB when the  target is approaching (up -ramp) while decreasing it when the target is departing (down -ramp).   With Figure 7.8 this is demonstrated for an approaching target using triangular modulation.

 On the reception side a low -noise pre- amplifier (LNA) is built in.  The IF signal is converted to bas e- band with an I/Q demodulator.  Typical IF frequencies are anywhere between 500  kHz and  10,7 MHz.

Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  49     8 Pulse Radar  8.1 The History of Pulse Radar   The first pulse Radars had a very low pulse repetition rate.  On one side, one could not create a  higher pulse rate and on the other side, one could not process it.  After the Second World War  the pulse repetition rate could be incrementally increased as much as the demanded, unique  range of coverage permitted. 
The until today valid fundamentals of pulse Radar technology  had been laid down by Colonel B lair of the US Signal Corps in a patent from 1938.   8.2 Transmission Types of Pulse Radar   Pulse Radar instruments can, in principle, be divided into four categories, of which however, not all are suitable for each application.  The subdivision takes places once  after the existence  of the phase preservation between the transmitting and receiving signal according to:   - Coherent Radar (phase preservation),   - Incoherent Radar (arbitrary phase from pulse to pulse),   as well according to the pulse repetition frequency  € PRF =fp:  - Low PRF (< 1000 Hz),  - High PRF (> 30000 Hz). 
 In Figure 8.1 the various transmission types in the time and frequency domain are represented.   Figure 8.1a shows a simple CW Radar instrument in the time and frequency domain.  A  moved target shifts the line in the frequency domain for the receiving signal of  € f0 to  € f0+fd. 
  At the output of the mixer one obtains:   € ±fd=fs−fE (8.1)  With pulse Radar the behavior is different.  Figure 8.1 b demonstrates time and frequency d o- main for Radars with low PRF:  € fp=1T(T=Period ) (8.2)  The pulse duration is until today, in most cases, considerably larger than the period duration of  the microwave carriers.  Through pulse modulation, a signal of  duration τ and periodic in c y- cle to the PRF will be sent from the microwave carrier. 
 With the Fourier transform of the e n- velope of the pulses, an envelope of the spectrum results in the frequency domain.  For a re c- tangular pulse the result is the sin x/x function in the frequency domain.  The linear spacing is  reciprocal to the period T. 
 Additional, Doppler shift superimposes with ±f d.  Coherent Radar devices could be developed only after accurate phase preserving high -gain  amplifiers were available.  Today the transmission signal is usually derived from quartz crystal  and/or from synthesizers. 
 The nonlinear distortions of the available amplifiers can be usually  neglected.  In Figure 8.1d the signals in the time and frequency domain for non -coherent pulse . Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  50     Radar are  represented. 
 Since there exists no phase reference from pulse to pulse, the signal is  spread and/or “smeared” over the spectrum.  The envelope of the spectrum is determined  through the Fourier transform of the pulses. A low PRF (Figure 8.1b and 8.2) allo ws a large unambiguous range of coverage, however this  leads to a very small unambiguous range of the Doppler frequency due to the dense linear spacing in the spectrum, i.e. 
ambiguities in the Doppler frequency develop if f d becomes > 1/T.   By higher PRF, as shown in Figure 8.1c, the opposite problem of unambiguity in the range to  target exists, since the period duration ∆t max = T = c 0/2Rmax is very small, while the Doppler  frequency is now unambiguous over a large velocity range.  In Figure 8.3 are represe nted the  spectra of the enlarged transmission and receiving signals.

The detai ls of the respective fundamental principles will be discussed following.   8.3 Simple Pulse Radar   The problem associated with CW Radar devices regarding the de -coupling from transmission  path to reception path is solved by pulse Radar through the temporal separa tion of transmis- sion and reception. 
 For the suppression of very strongly cross -talking transmission pulses into  the receiving system, the receiver input is short -circuited or decoupled by a circulator.  Figure  8.4 shows a typical, simple pulse Radar syste m.  To produce the pulses either magnetrons or  switched amplifiers are employed. 
There is no reference from the transmission oscillator to the  receiver, therefore non -coherent pulse Radar cannot measure Doppler and thus only the di s- tance and not the speed of a target can be determined.     Figure 8.4  Simple, non -coherent Radar.  . 
Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  52     8.4 Coherent Pulse Radar   Coherent pulse Radar is in the position to deliver information regarding the range as well as  Doppler information, i.e. the velocity and/or speed of an object.  H ere a coherent oscillator  (COHO) is introduced on the transmission side, which also delivers the phase reference for the receiving signal. 
 The transmitting oscillator (LO for Local Oscillator) is added on the tran s- mitting end and is again taken out at the  receiving end.  In comparison to the Doppler fr e- quency, which can be measured, both oscillators must be sufficiently stable for the entire time.  In Figure 8.5, an example of coherent pulse Radar, a quadrature modulator is employed to  additionally determi ne the direction of the target movement. 
    Figure 8.5  Coherent pulse Radar.   Two various fundamental methods of Doppler analysis are known and will be subsequently  and shortly introduced. [7]. 
The transmitting signal for pulse Radar is:   € Us=Assinω0t (8.3)  The reference signal:   ref ref ref t A U ϕω+ =0 sin  (8.4)  € ϕref = constant, e.g.  € ϕref=0. The receiving signal from a target at range R becomes:   € UE=AE⋅sin ω0+ωd ( )t−2ω0R c         (8.5) . 
Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  53     After combining one obtains:   € Udiff=Ud=Ad⋅sin2πfdt−4πf0R c         (8.6)   By demonstrating a video signal at the indicator it is possible to distinguish two cases:   € fd>1τ fd<1τ (8.7)  From which the illustrations according to Figure 8.6 result.   at bt c t  Figure 8.6  a) Transmitting si gnal b) Video signal f d > 1/τ, c) Video signal f d < 1/τ.  The pulsing is identical to a sample of the Doppler oscillation. 
 For uniqueness the  sampling theorem must be fulfilled, meaning at minimum each half period of the Do p- pler oscill ation must be sample d.  € PRF =4⋅vmax λ0 (8.8)  The resolution is a result of the observation period, meaning of the number of the used sample  values NFFT of the Fourier transform.  € Δv=λ0⋅PRF 2NFFT (8.9)  One speaks about blind frequencies for the phase differences  between the transmitting and  receiving signal of  € ±n2π. 
For blind frequencies  € fd=n⋅1 T=n⋅fblind results in a non - detectable Doppler frequency.  . Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  54        Figure 8.7  Blind speed. 
  8.5 MTI Radar (Moving Target Indication)   Moved or shifted targets can be detected in many ways and with many methods and partic u- larly due to:   - Doppler shift  - Range change from scan to scan   - Direction change from scan to scan     At first glance it is not therefore so necessary to integrate the elaborate Doppler signal p roc- essing.  In practice is it however so that the echoes from moved targets are not received alone,  but are rather surrounded by clutter, the echoes of all the reflecting objects found in the resol u- tion region.  This clutter mostly masks the echoes of move d objects. 
 By analyzing the Do p- pler shift, targets, which lay 20 – 30 dB under the clutter lever, can be discovered and s e- lected.  There are even examples for the detection of signals smaller by 70 - 90 dB.  Circuits,  which distinguish these echoes of mov ed targets from the clutter, are designated as Moving  Target Indicators (MTI). 
 8.5.1  MTI with Delay -Line Canceller   By being given a video signal of a pulse Doppler Radar on a display terminal with sweep (A - Scope) according to Figure 8.8c and then successively re presenting the echoes of the follo w- ing pulses, then one can obtain the curves a -e in Figure 8.8.  If one uses a display terminal  with memory and “writes” the echoes on top of one another, then one obtains Figure 8.8 Σ.   Fixed targets deliver constant echo a mplitudes, while moving targets deliver sine -shaped am- plitudes as in Figure 8.8c. 
 . Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  55     b c fa d e Σ   Figure 8.8  Time behaviour of moving targets ( ↓) on an oscilloscope.   For automatic analysis the fact that fixed -target echoes are constant from pulse to pulse is  used. 
 Bipolar video signals are separated into to channels, from which one is delayed by the  pulse duration T = 1/f p.  Then both are subtracted.  The procedure is illustrated in Figure 8.9. 
    Figure 8.9  MTI with Delay -Line Canceller.   The output of the subtractor can be utilized for the brightness modulation of a PPI scope  (Plane Position Indicator).  The delay time is equal to the period T of the signal. 
 With ele c- tromagnetic waves the necessary delay times within the µs - ms range cannot to be reached.   Instead one converts the signal into an acoustic wave and thereby achieves a larger delay time  around a factor of 105.  For some years digital delay methods have been used in addition to the  analog methods. 
 The signal is sampled and read into a shift register.  The “range gates” d e- termine the cycling  (see section 8.6).  Examples for MTI Radar and Delay Line Cancellers are shown in Figures 8.10 and 8.11. 
 A single Delay Line Canceller shows a sine characteristic for  the suppression of the clutters.  If one sets two Single Delay Line Cancellers one behind the other, then a squared sine characteristic results.  In continuation, all well -known filter stru c- tures (Butterworth, Chebyshev, Bessel, Elliptical, etc.) can be reali zed. 
 In addition the MTI . Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  56     function can be obtained on the IF side.  The equations from above apply with the substitution  ωd → ω ZF ± ωd. 
 Good circuits suppress fixed targets to 1% (voltage).     Figure 8.10  Block diagram of MTI Rada r.  Trigger Generato r Modulato rCarrier Oscillato rDelay line Attenuatio nAmplifier Det.

Range and Doppler frequency regions are divided into sub -regions,  which are processed separately. 
 Figure 8.12 shows this division into sub -regions for the range.

  The false alarm rate with this procedure is considerably lower than MTI with delay li ne can- cellation because of the low bandwidth of the filter.  With new devices the video signal (bip o- lar) is sampled and processed by computer.  Here, the Fourier transform replaces the filter. 
 . Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  58     8.7 Impulse Integration for Increasing the Sens itivity   With all Radar devices, which are not agile from pulse to pulse, several pulses are reflected  from a target with each sample instance.  One identifies the summation of all pulses from a target as integration. 
 The detection becomes even better the more reflected energ y from the  target is received and integrated.  From the Radar equation possibilities for an apparent energy  increase can be seen.  They each exist only for only one pulse. 
 In this section the dwell time  for a target will also be considered.  It results in  the hits per scan n B and depends on the fo l- lowing:  - Pulse repetition rate f p [Hz],  - Half- power bandwidth of the antenna θB [Grad],  - Scan- rate of the antenna SΘ [Grad/sec].  € nB=ΘBfp ˙ Θ S (8.10)  Common by rotating Radar sys tems:   € 10<nB<15 (8.11)  For systems with high PRF (Pulse Doppler for short ranges), values of a few hundred for n B  can be obtained. 
 The integration can always take place at two different places in the signal  path:   - IF Integration   ⇒ Pre-dete ction or Coherent integration,   - Video Integration  ⇒ Post-detection or Incoherent integration.   Coherent integration (pre -detection) is only seldom used, since it assumes a constant phase  between transmission and receiving for the pulses to be integrated.  The integration can then,  for example, take place through a narrow IF filter, whose bandwidth is inversely proportional  to the target dwell time. 
 A sample rate of 360o/sec and a 2o half- power bandwidth result in a  dwell time of 1/180 sec.  That means tha t the integration filter has a bandwidth of 180 Hz.   The integration effect is obtained by the energy storage in the filter. 
 The quality of the filter  determines the integration efficiency.  In the following the non -coherent integration will be  described in more detail.   8.7.1  Incoherent Integration   For incoherent integration the following considerations apply. 
 If n pulses are summed in an  ideal integration, then the S/N ratio at the output of the integrator improves by a factor n.  This  practically cannot be ac hieved by incoherent integration, since additional noise develops when  rectifying.  The improvement, which can be achieved by an operator with a storage tube, is  approximately proportional to  € n. 
From Marcum [6] the achievable improvem ent, henceforth  identified as integration efficiency, is calculated.     . Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  59       The efficiency for n pulses is defined by:  € E(n)=(SN)1 n(SN)n (8.12)  (S/N) 1 = S/N for one pulse. 
  (S/N) n = S/N for one pulse of the same probability of detection Pd and false alarm  rate Pfa with the integration of n pulses.  Then one obtains:    € n⋅E(n)=I(n)=(SN)1 (SN)n     (8.13)  I(n) is the integration factor.  Near this factor the power of the Radar can be reduced by the  integration in relation to the case, which is not integrated. 
 I(n) is represented in Figure 8.14.   The probability of detection Pd and the false alarm rate Pfa are of minor influence. Often the  integration loss (Equation 8.14) is also stated as demonstrated in Figure 8.15.

  With a given false alarm rate and detection p robability the increase in the range of coverage  can be calculated by integration with the modified Radar equation according to equation (3.8)  and the integration gain (Figure 8.14 and/or Equation 8.10).  In the Radar equation the follo w- ing is replaced:   € PRmin=kTBnL(S/N)1 (8.15)  T = Temperature in Kelvin, (S/N) 1 = required signal -to-noise ration for a pulse, B n = noise  bandwidth, L = system losses.

Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  61     - Binary integration   With tapped delay line integration, accordin g to Figure 8.16, analog or digital signals are fed  into a tapped delay line, whose length corresponds to the number of hits per scan n B.  At the  output one obtains a maximum if n successive echoes are received from a target.  The exec u- tion of an analog tapped delay line can be realized by RLC bandpass resonators, RC elements,  static memory elements or mechanically circulating samplers. 
 Shift registers are used for dig i- tal integration.  The advantage of the tapped delay line is that any weighting of the ta ps is pos- sible, for example, in order to strengthen the wanted pulses or weaken the older pulses.   1 2 nTapped delay line Video in Integrated output  Figure 8.16  Incoherent integrator with a tapped delay line. 
  The loop integration, as shown in Figure 8.17, as a rule has a poor efficiency as discussed ea r- lier.  This is due to the fact that the loop gain k must be smaller than 1 in order to hinder an  oscillation.  Single- step arrangements make possible a loop gain of up to .9, dual -step up to  .98. 
 The loop gain is dependent upon the number of the pulses th at must be integrated.

  8.8 Pulse Compression for Improving  the Resol ution  As has been already said in the previous section, the range of coverage is determined primarily  by the total energy, which is received from a target.  There the energy has been increased through the integration of several pulses.  The same effect can be achieved by the increase of  the pulse duration τ. 
 The precision of the range measurement is independent upon the pulse  duration so that there are no given restrictions here.  The resolution of two neighbouring ta r- gets, as has been shown in s ection 2.6, is calculated with the autocorrelation function and/or  with the cross- correlation.  Thus the resolution is directly dependent upon the pulse duration. 
  According to this, the signal at the receiver must be temporally shortened (i.e. compressed)   when dealing with longer pulses, this in order to improve the range resolution as well as the precision and the sensitivity.  Procedures of this type have been developed in communication theory long before they found use in Radar technology. 
 In order to make possible this co m- pression the transmitting signal must be modulated in the pulse (intra -pulse modulation), again  in order to obtain marks within the pulse duration.  Digital and analog procedures will be d e- scribed in the following.   8.8.1  Compression of a fr equency modulated pulse (chirp)   One of the first procedures for the realization of pulse compression involved the frequency modulation of the transmitting pulses. 
 The procedure is clearly demonstrated in Figure 8.19.   The transmitting pulse, which is represented by a rectangle in Figure 8.19a is, as shown in  Figure 8.19b, linearly frequency modulated between f 1 and f2.  Figure 8.19c illustrates the time  procedure. 
 The signal re -received over the signal path is fed into a frequency dependent filter,  according to Figure 8.19e.  The first arriving low frequency f1 is delayed around t2, and the . Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  63     later, higher frequencies delayed only around t1. 
 Through this it is achieved that the entire  power of the long transmitting pulses “simultaneously” leave the compression filter within a  very short pulse, according to Figure 8.19d.   timeamplitude frequency frequencyamplitude amplitudetime time time time  Figure 8.19  Frequency modulated pulse compression.   Figure 8.20 shows how the high resolution is regained. 
There is no time separation possible  before the compression. After the compression  the possibility for time separation depends  upon the amplitudes of the target echoes and the side lobes of the compressed function.  . 
Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  64       Figure 8.20  Echoes of neighboring targets: left: before the compression, right: after the  compression.     Figure 8.21  Typical block diagram for Radar with FM pulse compression.   All filters with frequency dependent delay times are suitable for use as compression filters. 
  For the case on hand a high -pass filter, as a waveguide, would be suitable.  If the higher fr e- quencies are to be delayed, opposite of the example in Figure 8.19, then low -pass filters can be  . Radar System Engineeri ng Chapter 8 – Pulse Radar  65     used. 
 With newer devices acoustic delay lines (surface and material waves) are used.  It is  important that the filter is adapted to the frequency pass (i.e. matched filters). 
 If it delays too little, the compression is not fully reached. If it delays too much, then the pulse is again di s- persed, not compressed.  Today the employment of FM pulse compression no longer serves to  increase the energy of a pulse. 
 In fact, bro ad spectra are used in order reduce the coded spe c- tral energy density and thus avoid that Radar -warning stations & receivers discover any acti v- ity.  The procedures range even to Spread Spectrum and coded noise (PN -Codes = Pseudo  Noise Codes).  In Figure 8.1 9 a rectangular pulse and a linear FM and compression were assumed. 
 From that  results a compressed pulse shape of sin x/x.  If one identifies the frequency pass with B and  the pulse duration with τ, then the amplitude of the pulse is proportional to  τBand the width  to 2/B.  Under these conditions the Fourier transform of the compressed pulse of the entrance  pulse has the form:  € sin(πBt) πBt (8.17)  The overshoot of Function (8.17) would interfere with the video detection. 
 In practice a re c- tangular pulse is not realizable and this problem does not arise. In fact almost any frequency  modulation and pulse form is used, only if the compression filter is adapted to it, meaning that  it is a matched filter.  Following this the envelo pe of the compressed FM pulse is briefly d e- scribed and derived. 
  If it is defined that the impulse response of the impulse function δ(t) equals h(t), then one can  obtain the response of any function x(t) if one divides the function into durations of ∆ τ, as  shown in Figure 8.22.  f (t) f (t)f (τ) Δτ τt1 t2 t   Figure 8.22  Division of the pulse function.   The impulse function δ(t) with the duration ∆ τ has the amplitude x(t).

The deterioration is identified as compress ion loss. 
 8.8.2  Digital Pulse Compression   With digital technology for pulse compression the transmitting signal is either amplitude or phase modulated, where as a rule the phase modulation is preferred because of the larger total  energy content of the signal.  T he two most used procedures employ the:  .

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  75     10 Synthetic Aperture Radar   10.1 Resolution Limits of Conventional Radar D evices   The achievable resolution capability of conventional pulse Radar devices is, as already d e- scribed, determined by:   - Pulse duration τ for range resolution  - Half- power bandwidth θ H for the resolution of the angle   The resolution in the propagation direction, i.e. 
range, is approximately:   € ΔR≈c0τ 2 (10.1)   Then orthogonal to that in azimuth, i.e. cross range, is given with the  half- power bandwidth:  € Δz≈θ3dB⋅R; θ3dB≈68°⋅λ a for cos2-taper         (10.2)  Presently it is assumed that two targets can be separated if their echoes overlap at the 3 dB  points (half power).  With various new algorithms an increased resolution can be achieved. 
  Normally the azi muth values are in particular dissatisfactory for large ranges, as they arise for  Earth exploration by Radar from satellites.  With a range of 300 km and a half -power ban d- width of 1°, the resolution is ∆z = 5,2 km.   10.2 Procedures for Improving the Resolution   10.2.1  Range Resolution with Pulse Compression   The range resolution can be improved with shorter pulse duration and/or a larger FM ban d- width. 
 Procedures for the synthetic shorten ing of the pulse duration have already been dealt  with through digital and analog pulse compression and are used in practice.  With this pulse  times after compression of 1 ns or smaller can be achieved, meaning that the resolution ∆R  amounts to around 15 c m.  At the receiver and/or with signal processing there must then be an  available bandwidth of >1 GHz. 
 For Earth explor ation a small degradation of the range res o- lution results from the angled or diagonal view as repr esented in Figure 9.1.  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  76        Figure 10.1  Range resolution of a Radar with a diagonal incident wave trajectory. 
    The range resolution from Equations (9.1) & (9.3) correspond to the notation and identif iers  from Figure 9.1.  € Δx=cτ cosα⋅1 cosα=cτ 2⋅secα (10.3)  10.2.2  Improvement of the Azimuth Resolution   For the resolution of the azimuth according to Equation (9.2) only the range R and the half - power bandwidth θH are suggested.  Consequently, with the search for possibilities for the  improvement of the resolution orthogonal to the propagation direction, there re main no other  altern atives than the reduction of θH. 
Figure 9.2 shows a surface, which is illuminated by R a- dar from an altitude or height h at an angled incidence.  With pulse compression a region in  the range can be resolved, from here according to Equati on (9.3), as shown:     Figure 10.2  Illumination and region of resolution.   In order to achieve the azimuth resolution, as shown, θH must be decreased accor dingly. 
 From  the aperture a, a good approximation of half- power bandwidth results:  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  77     € ΘH=λ aθHinrad [ ] (10.4)  From here the azimuth resolution is   € Δz−θHR=λ aR (10.5)  If, for example, one would require a range resolution of 1,5 m at a range of 100 km, then the  aperture for 10 GHz would result from:  km cm Rza 2 1015037= =Δ=λ (10.6)  It is not practically possible to realize an antenna of this size.   The fundamental idea for improvement is now a fixed flight route or zone with moving Radar,  which itself is used as an aperture. 
 Thus it is possible to create a very large aperture through the synthet ic “stringing together” of the physical aperture as the Radar moves.  This procedure  is identified as SAR, which stands for " S ynthetic Aperture Radar ".  The fundamentals of this  procedure are described in more detail in the following sections. 
  10.3 Basic Princi ple of SAR   "Synthetic Aperture Radar" [24], henceforth referred to as SAR, operates from a moving ca r- rier, which moves along or over the target area.  An example “fly -by” is illustrated in Figure  9.3.    Figure 10.3  Three -dimensional representation of SAR g eometry. 
   . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  78     Point C of the illuminated target area, or foot print, is seen during the “fly -by” so long, as the  carrier is within the half -power bandwidth of the directivity of the antenna.  This means that  information from the target point C can be collecte d over the entire time of the “fly -by”. 
 The actual problem exists in the synthesizing or the piecing together of the various parts of  information.  As the best criterion for this the phase gradient and/or the change of the phase of  the Doppler frequency is  used.  In practice one speaks about the “Doppler history.”  The  change of the phase represents the relative velocity. 
 Each object, which is acquired from mo v- ing Radar, delivers a defined progression of the Doppler frequency.  From this the aspect angle  0θ, the velocity of movements, the height h, and the range R are determined.  Figure 9.4  shows the associated array of curves. 
   Figure 10.4  Curves of the same range (iso -range contours, circles) and relative velocity  (iso-Doppler conto urs, hyperbolas).     The iso- Doppler contours are the places for all objects of the same Doppler frequency if the  Radar is moving with the velocity v F at a height h of above the ground.  With a fixed place of  an object in the x- y plane, the iso- Doppler contour moves away with the flying Radar. 
 The  iso-Doppler contours clusters are dependent on the height h (h=1.5 R in Figure 9.4).  The . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  79     smallest change of the relative velocity and therefore the Doppler frequency results for objects  ahead. 
The largest relativ e Doppler frequency changes result from transverse objects.   The Doppler history for transverse objects is shown next to each other in Figure 9.5, as they result from a “fly -by”, for successive resolution regions.  The lines begin, where the scatterer  is seen first by the Radar antenna and end, when it leaves the antenna main beam. 
  fd tDoppler Historien   Figure 10.5  Progression of the Doppler frequency for successive resolution cells  (Doppler histories).   Since the curvature of the iso -Doppler contours for transverse objects is very slight and the  changes are almost linear, the Doppler history frequencies also progress linearly.  The task of  the analysis with SAR consists of separating the Doppler criteria, thereby to determine and  represent the cell amplitudes. 
  10.4 Theoretical Basic s of SAR   The mathematical treatment of the SAR characteristics result on the basis of Figure  9.6. Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  80        Figure 10.6  Identifiers for calculating SAR.     The Radar, at the height y=h0 with z=0, x=0, illuminates a point P, whose coordinates are (x0,  0, z0). 
 The s ynthetic aperture should be determined for the region L, which is symmetric  around z=0.  L corresponds to the illumination width on the ground and is therefore the route of the Radar, while object P will be seen.  The airplane flies over L with a constant velocity v. 
  The flight time T is then:   € T=L v   The range R to the point P is calculated from the coordinates:   € R=x02+(z0−vt)2+h02 (10.7)  2 2TtTwith +<<−  (10.8)  For large ranges or R, compared to synthetic aperture L (L<<R), on e can express R with the  median range:   € R=x02+z02+h02 (10.9)  € cosθ0=z0 R0 (10.10)     After developing Equation (9.7) with a Taylor series for t:  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  81     € R=R0⋅(1−vt R0cosθ0+v2t2 2R02sin2θ0) (10.11)  the Doppler frequency f d is obtained from the change in rang e  € dRdt:  € vd=dR dt=−vcosθ0+v2t R0sin2θ0 (10.12)  € fd=−2vd λ (10.13)  € fd=2v λ⋅cosθ0−2v2t λR0sin2θ0 (10.14)  The first term in Equation (9.14) is the angle dependent Doppler frequency.  The second term  reproduces the change of the Doppler fre quency. 
 The progression of f d is demonstrated in  Figure 9.5.  Tow points P and P’, which have the same distance R0 from the Radar, distinguish  themselves in azimuth are the route D.  This route of the Radar is flown in the following time:   € Δt=D v⋅1 sinθ0 (10.15)  Substituted into Equation (9.14) the following Doppler frequencies for P and P’ result:   € fd(P)=2v λcosθ0(t=0)         (10.16)  € fd(P')=2v λcosθ0−v2D λR0sinθ0 (t=Δt)          (10.17)  The Doppler frequencies between P and P’ amount to:   € Δfd=2vD λR0sinθ0 (10.18)  The maximum sampling period T in order to separate these 2 targets with a distance D is ca l- culated by:   € T=1 Δfd (10.19)  In time T the Radar moves along the route, which corresponds to the synthetic aperture L:   € L=vT=R0λ 2Dsinθ0 (10.20) . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  82     10.5 Maximum Resolution Capability   For consideration of the resolution capability D, it must be ensured that the Radar contin u- ously illuminates the target, while it moves in the z direction for the length of the synthetic  aperture  € L.  From this the result according to Equation (9.5) is:   00 00 0 sin sin sin θθθλ θR R azLH= ⋅=Δ=  (10.21)  The requirement of the half- power bandwidth of the antenna θH is:  00 sin RL aHθθλ≥ =  (10.22)  The following is obtained by replacing  € L in Equation (9.22) with (9.20)  2,2aDD a≥ ≥λ λ  (10.23)  The achievable resolution D is consequently equal to the half aperture of the real antenna.   Worth noting here is that this is independent of all other parameters like frequency, range, a s- pect angle, and flying altitude. 
 Since the range of coverage is dependent on the aperture with  1/a2, there are in practice, even aside from the complexity of the processing, limits placed upon  the resolution.  For the derivation of resolution there also exist  other approximations.   10.6 Analysis Procedures   When describing possible analysis methods it is useful to regard the progression of the Dop-pler frequencies according to Equation (9.14). 
 The change in the Doppler frequency leads to a linear frequency modulation (see Figure 9.5).  In Sec.  8.8 it has been shown for analog pulse  compression, that through the Fourier transformation of a linear FM signal in the time domain a compressed signal with the envelope sin x/x results. 
 The FM -bandwidth B and the duration  τ of the FM signal determine the compression.  With SAR the duration is:     € τ=T  (10.24)  B from Equation (9.19):  € Δfmax=B=2v2T λR0sin2θ0 (.25)  The linear FM rate b arises from this as:   € b=B2π T=4πv2 λR0sin2θ0 (10.26)      . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  83     The time function of the received signal has the following phase:   € ϕ(t)=ω0t−ϕ0+4π λvtcosθ0−2πv2t2 λR0sin2θ0 ⇓⇓ ⇓ ⇓ =2πf0t−4πR0 λ+2πfdtcosθ0−1 2bt2 (10.27)(10.28)            The amplitude is:     € x(t)=cosϕ(t) (10.29)  If the signal passes through a matched filter, meaning a filter, which has the opposite fre- quency characterist ic as the received frequency, the result is the function:     € g(t)=const ⋅cos(ω0+ωd 2)t⋅sin(1 24πv2T λR0tsin2θ0) 1 24πv2T λR0tsin2θ0 (10.30)  Here the matched filter has been tuned to  € f0+fd. 
 The power spectral density of the filter  response is proportional to the square:   € S(t)~sin12bTt( ) 12bTt        t2 (10.31)  Figure 10.7 shows the function.    Figure  11110.7  Envelope of the receiving signal of SAR.    .

If two neighbouring points reproduce two (sin x/x)2  responses, then they can be directly r e- solved if the envelopes are “cut” within the 3 dB points.

  € Dmin=R0λ 2 (10.35)  The processing which has been illustrated until here, is in practice more difficult due to the  pulsed transmitting signal.  Each rectangular pulse has a spectrum, whose envelope is the Fo u- rier transform of the pulse, and whose linear separation is the pulse sequence frequency.  The  middle frequency of the rece ived signal has a constant offset around f d for the transmitting  signal:   € fd=2v λcosθ (10.36) . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 9 – Synthetic Aperture Radar  85     To this is added the respective offset resulting from the linear FM modulation within the a n- tenna beam -width, which contains the actual information.  T his means that the reception spe c- trum shifts towards the transmission spectrum, as shown in Figure  10.9.    Figure 10.9  Transmission and reception spectrum. 
      Consequently, the analysis has the following tasks:   To correctly filter the amplitude and phase o f the reception spectrum,   To apply a Fourier transform to the linear FM.   10.7 PRF Determination   The resolution D of SAR in azimuth is, as has been shown, equal to half of the antenna length  a/2.  For processing a pulse must be available for each resolution cell  of the azimuth, since  otherwise the optimal resolution cannot be achieved. 
 From this results:   € fpmin=1 Tp=v Dsinθ0=2v asinθ0 (10.38)  To avoid ambiguities in range, the maximum PRF is:     € fpmax=c0 2ΔRmax     ∆Rmax is the swath width.  Thus the following is the range for f p:  € c0 2ΔRmax>fp>2v asinθ0 (10.40).

 Plane wave s, whereby only the far field characteristics will be dealt with,  can be scattered more or less directed by dielectric or metallic bodies.  This scattering is addi- tionally dependent upon polarization.  The amount and/or strength of this scattering is d e- scribed by the RCS ( Radar  Cross-S ection ). 
 Starting from the conventional definition of the  scalar scattering cross- section the fundamentals of Radar polarimetry and the polarization sca t- tering matrix will be entered in this chapter as well as will be introdu ced new, coherent p o- larimetric measuring methods, a revised definition of a complex scattering cross -section, a  scattering cross -section matrix, and an object oriented polarization scattering matrix.   11.1 Definition of the Radar Backscattering Cross - Section   The common way to define the Radar cross -section is with use of the Radar equation.  For a  homogenous, loss- less, isotropic medium and a universally bistatic configuration according to  Figure 11.1, the Radar cross -section σ is defined by:  € σ=4π λ02PrLr Gr4πRr2        Lt GtPt4πRt2        Lp (11.1)   Where r=receiving, t=transmitting, p=polarization, and L=losses. 
  With this  € Rt should be so large that the object lies in the far field of the impinging waves as  well should  € Rr→∞(approaching infinity) so that the receiving antenna lies in the far field of  the scattering body.  If one expresses σ from Equation (11.1) as a relationship of the electric  field strength at the receiving antenna to the field strength of the inci dent plane wave front at  the object, then the result is:      € σ=4π⋅limR2 R→∞⋅  E S⋅  E S*   E i⋅  E i* (11.2)  Where s=scattered and i=incident.   Usually the cross- section is based on an area of 1m2 and is stated in dB as  € σ/dBm2=10logσ 1m2        . 
  Stated clearly in words the Rada r cross- section  € σ of a target is the projected area of metal  sphere (where the projected area of a sphere is a circle with A= πr2) which would return the  same amount of power to the Radar as the actual target.  .

  The given definition applies for the general bistatic case  € θi,φi,θS,φSarbitrary ( ). In practice  receiving and sending antennas are often identical, meaning  € θi=θS and  € φi=φS. σ can then be  referred to as Radar Backscattering Cross- Section, the Radar geometry being monostatic. 
 If  the receiving and sending antennas are not the same, one then speaks of quasi -monostatic R a- dar if the antennas are close to one another, meaning  € θi≈θS and  € φi≈φS.  For further consi d- eration it is important that σ characterizes the target for only one frequency and one polariz a- tion at given aspect angles  € θi,φi,θS,φS( ) and it doesn’t contain any phase information of the  scattering.  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 89     11.2 Fundamentals of Radar polarimetry   11.2.1  Polarization   An important attribute of scattering, namely polarization and depolarization (the object cond i- tional change of incident to scattered polarization), is only considered with the scalar Rada r  equation in the form of a general loss term.  An arbitrary, polarized, plane wave can always be  represented through the linear combination of two orthogonal fields.  For example, a wave  impinges, coming from  € +∞ (direction of propagat ion z), on an object, then the incident ele c- tric field reads as a superposition of two linear, orthogonal polarized waves in the linear (hor i- zontal -vertical) reference system. 
     €   E i=  E hi+  E vi=Exi e x+Eyi e y ( )⋅ejωt+βz ( ) (11.3)   For representing a state of polarization the pola rization ellipse is frequently used, as in Figure  11.2.  It describes a curve, which the real part of the electrical field vector    €   E i(z,t) goes  through, if either the position “z” is held constant (z=constant) and the time “t” runs or the  time “t” is held constant (t=constant) and the position “z” changes.  The angle τ between three - dimensional axes and the semi -major axis of the ellipse is called the rotation angle.

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 90     € m=tanεwith −45°≤ε≤+45°    Thus waves without ellipticity ( ε=0) are linearly polarized.  Those with ε=±π/4 are circular.   With the decision of the propagation direction and  of the sign (+/ -) the polarization will be  defined as left-  (ε>0) or right -handed (ε<0). 
  Ex ExEy ωtωt   Figure 11.3  Circularly polarized wave.     Figure 11.3 shows the trajectory of an electrical field vector of a circularly polarized wave  along the time axis, if a fix ed position is considered.   11.2.2  Polarization Scattering Matrix   If one describes an incident wave on an object with “i“ and the radiated wave at the receiver  with “r“ with the superposition of horizontal and vertical polarized electric fields according to  Equati on (11.3) the result is:  € Ehr Evr        =ShhShv SvhSvv        ⋅Ehi Evi             (11.4)  The matrix [S ] is called the Polarization Scattering Matrix. 
 The four parameters are complex  amplitudes, meaning that a scattering object is described by 8 scalar magnitudes.  They co n- tain all in formation about the scattering behaviour of an object with frequency, object orient a- tion, sender and receiver position.  Thus far the scattering matrix has been defined in a linear  framework (in the following: ξ, η  for h,v), since in practice linear polar ized antennas are e m- ployed. 
 Circular or elliptical “orthogonal” polarized antennas deliver the same information content.  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 91     11.3 Complex Radar Cross -Section and RCS M atrix  If [S] and R are known, then σ can be calculated for any arbitrary sender and receiver pol ariza- tion. 
 € σξn=lim R→∞4πR2⋅Sξn2 (11.5)   The polarization scattering matrix additionally contains phase and polarization information.   As is to see from Equation (11.4) and (11.5), the observation distance R is also a parameter, whereby in practice it is only possible to evaluate the parameters relative to each other.  In  order to eliminate the disadvantages of the conventional definitions of σ and [ S ], which were  introduced in the previous sections, in the following section 2 new terms will be derived, which more adequately fulfill the requirements of coherently measuring Radar systems. 
 They  can be looked upon as consequent enhancements of th e old definitions and they don’t contr a- dict these old definitions.  If one introduces a reference range R 0 from the coordinate origin,  then reference planes for the incident and scattered wave can be defined according to Figure 11.4.  R 0 is thereby an arbitrarily selectable, however fixed radius, which can, for example,  coincide with the radius of a reference sphere. 
    Figure 11.4  Introduction of reference planes with a distance of from the origin, with fixed  scattered field.   The incident wave can actually  be represented by a plane wave (for  € Rt→∞) at the reference  plane R0, and consequently a phase and amplitude reference can be created through R0. The  scattered field, however, can only be represented by a fictitious plane wave at R0, since the  reference plane is not necessarily in the far -field of the scatterer. 
This fictitious plane wave - field    €  E s can be defined by the following transformation via the receiving field strength:  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 92        €   E s=4πR2 4πR02⋅ejβ(R−R0)⋅  E r(R) (11.6)   Note: R must lie in the far field of the emitter, however  € R0 not.    Clearly is    €  E sthe field strength with  € R0, brought about by an isotropic emitter at the origin,  which affects the receiving field strength     €  E r with radius R. 
 Starting from Equations (11.2)  and (11.5), the complex Radar cross- section σ can be defined with the transformation from  Equation (11.6).     € σξη=lim R→∞4πR2⋅ej2β(R−R0)⋅Eξr Eηi          2 =4πR02⋅EξS Eηi⋅ej2(ϕS−ϕi) ϕ      (11.7a)   (11.7b)   € R0   Range from the origin to the reference planes,   € ξ,η Orthogonal polarizations ( vertical or horizontal),   € ϕS   Phase of the ξ- components of the scattered field with R0,    € ϕi     Phase of the η- components of the incident field with R0.  The definition is so chosen that the absolute of σξη coincides with the known Radar cross - section σ from Equation (11.2). 
 The usefulness of the phase definition is most clearly e x- plained by the example of the monostatic measurement.  Thereby merge the two reference  planes.  The measurement of a metallic sphere with radius R0 results in a phase shift of ϕ=(ϕ s- ϕi)=180° at the sphere forefront. 
 The phase ϕ behaves like one of the reflection factors by a  short circuit and with it defines a unique reference phase.  With the definition of the complex Radar cross- section from Equation (11.7) the scat tering matrix, according to Equation (11.4),  consequently results in a complex Radar cross -section matrix (RCS Matrix).   € σ[]=σhhσhv σvhσvv         withEhS EvS        =1 4πR02⋅σ[]⋅Ehi Evi          (11.8a)    (11.8b)  The complex RCS Matrix contains the same information as the polarization scattering matrix,  but is not dependent on the observation range, meaning that it is object specific. 
 Correspon d-. Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 93     ingly an object oriented polarization scattering matrix [ So] can be introduced by means of  Equation (11.8b), for which applies:  € S0[]=σ m2         (11.9)  11.4 RCS M easurement Techniques   It is possible to distinguish between the following principle procedures in RCS measurement  techniques:   - Scalar RCS measurements   ⇒  € σ,S  - Complex RCS measurements   ⇒  € σ,S  - Polarimetric RCS mea surements ⇒  € σ[],S[]  These types of modulation have a considerable influence on the measurement system:   - Pulse modulation,   - FM- CW modulation,   - Stepped frequency (CW)   Measurements can be carried out in closed, low -reflective rooms, so -called anechoic cha m- bers, and in open -air.   11.4.1  Measurement of the Scalar Radar Cross -Section σ  RCS measurements have been common since the introduction of Radar technology. 
 They  have been carried out for the determination of σ as well as scattering diagrams σ = f(Θ).  For  this conventional Radar devices are frequently used.  The technology is comparable to the measurement of antennas; there are similar given technical requirements and legalities to co n- sider. 
 The primary difference is the increased attenuation ov er the range of the measurement  signal, which travels twice along the path from the measurement antenna to the measurement  object.  Measuring paths in absorption chambers the attenuation is 100  dB to 150  dB for co m- mon measuring distances of 10 to 20 m.  In  large free -space test ranges the attenuation is co n- siderable higher. 
 This value, plus the required dynamic for the measurement of 30 dB to 60 dB, yield the required decoupling between the transmitting and receiving sectors of 130  dB to  200 dB.  The procedures for measuring scalar RCS will not be further discussed, instead, in the following the concentration will be on polarimetric RCS determination.   11.4.2  Measurement of The Complex Polarization Scattering M a- trix  The Radar signature of scattering objects, expres sed by the complex RCS σ, is a function of  various parameters:   σ = ƒ(frequency, polarization, aspect angle)  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 94     The requirements of the measuring system for an as complete as possible description of the  scattering object result accordingly:   Broadband, if possible more than an octave ,  Coherent, for measuring a complex Radar cross -section σ   Measurement of the complex polarimetric RCS Matrix,   Variable aspect angle ( θ i, φ i, θ s, φ s)  Additionally, possibilities for the separation of disruptive influences, for calibrating the RCS Matrix as well as for acquiring the measurement data, must be available.  Present Radar sy s- tems inadequately fulfill these demands.   Since 1984 there has been a new generation of modern vector -network analyzers, conceived  for the measurement of microwave compone nts. 
 Such vector -network analyzers (VNwa) can  be employed as the core of a new type of RCS measurement system, especially for use in lab o- ratories.  The fundamental principle had been described for the first time in 1974 and the first realization was intro duced in 1985.  Already with the still simple and non -sophisticated struc- tures advantages could be shown compared to conventional Radar systems, like linear FM  Radar or pulse Radar. 
 In this way the sum of such characteristics, as sensitivity, dynamic  range, reproducibility, coherency, polarimetry and bandwidth, have been greatly advanced by new orders of magnitude.  Figure 11.5 shows a simplified block diagram of the Radar cross -section measurement proc e- dure upon the basis of vector -network analysis for the case of a quasi -monostatic, polarimetric  antenna configuration.  A frequency synthesizer transmits discrete frequencies over the mea s- uring bandwidth during a cycle. 
 A part of the power is fed into a reference channel and builds the magnitude and phase reference.  The passing signal is radiated from the transmitting a n- tenna.   The polarimetric antenna system consists of 2 antennas, each with orthogonal polarization (vertical and horizontal). 
 With a HF emitter successive horizontal and vertical polarized si g- nals are send, while both polarizations are simultaneously fed into the measuring channels.  In  the receiver the signals of the test and reference channel are converted to IF in a phase - preserving way.  Then, the ratio of both signals according to magnitud e and phase is calcu- lated. 
This relationship yields the non -calibrated RCS of the measuring objects.  With the  VNwa principle it is important that the obtained phase information remains and the crucial noise bandwidth for the sensitivity is determined by t he narrow filter width of the IF stage (in  the order of a few kHz) and not by the full measuring bandwidth (typically some GHz).   In principle the RCS measuring system is a CW Radar, however with substantially extended abilities. 
 Equipment of this kind is called instrumentation Radar.  The Fourier transform of the  signals, received in the frequency range,  into the time domain corresponds to a pulse response  with a resolution corresponding to the measuring bandwidth. This procedure is related to pulse  compression.

The measurement system is complete in block 1 of Figure  11.6. 
 The measuring object of interest is represented in block 3, where the transmitting and  receiving paths are shown respectively in block 2 and 4.  In th e available case the system is  polarimetrically constructed with two linear, orthogonal polarizations.  This will be maintained  in the following without restriction of the general validity, since any other arbitrary orthogonal  polarization can be derived f rom it.

There are two distinguishable error categories with measurement systems: systematic errors  and statistical errors. 
 The following error model exclusively corrects the systematic errors,  while the statistical errors can normally be reduced through integration.  The error model co n- siders the following contributions:   Error due to the environment (e.g. non -ideal anechoic measurement chamber),   Error due to the coupling of th e transmitting into the receiving channel,   Errors, which have been caused due to the coupling between the orthogonal receiving  channels of the polarimetric measurement system (antenna as well as cables and  electronics),   Errors, which arise due to the coupl ing of the transmitting channel   Errors, which arise along the transmission path. 
  The used measuring system measures complex voltages or power waves ( Watt  ).  Therefore  it is favourable to describe the behaviour of the object by its complex scatt ering matrix [ Sc].   The measuring system doesn’t have direct access to the object, as is obvious to see in Figure  11.6. 
 It determines the incoming waves ah & av and the outgoing waves bh & bv, whereby h  and v respectively symbolize horizontal and vertical  polarization.  The correct scattering m a- trix [Sc] can consequently not be directly determined.  The matrix is measured [ Sm], which  additionally to [Sc] still considers the transmission and receiving paths Tξη & Rξη, as well as  the direct isolation Iξη. 
 The entire measuring system can be described with the scattering m a- trices upon this basis:     € Sm[]=I[]+R[]Sc[]T[] (11.10)  In component form Equation (11.10) reads:  .

Same indices mean co - polarization and different indices mean cross -polarization. 
 All terms Iξη, Tξη and Rξη contri b- ute to the determination of Sξη as complex magnitudes.  The error model itself is constructed  based upon this scattering parameter description of the signal path.  The measured magnitudes  (m) result from the corrected magnitudes (c) due to additive and multiplicative error influences. 
  In Equation (11.11) the complete mathematical model is given in matrix form.   The Equation (11.11) is not suitable to demonstrate the physical interpretation of the errors, as well as the vectorial corre ction.  A form often used in scattering parameter technology, as such  to represent graphical relationships, is the signal flow graph according to Mason. 
 With it the  relationship between the measured scattering matrix [ S m] and [S c] can be described.  Becau se  of the many crossovers of the paths, which arise with a polarimetric system, a three - dimensional representation is advantageous.  In Figure 11.7 this 3 -D signal flow graph is de m- onstrated by a cube, with which lie the signal paths on the edges and diago nals. 
 It is in the  coming text referred to as an error cube.  The polarimetric in and output gates, which [ Sm]  and/or ah, av and bh, bv demonstrates, are in the foremost 4 corners of the cube.  The front  surface of the cube is therefore identified as the Radar plane. 
 This front surface contains the  isolation errors Iξη, which arise due to the over -coupling between the receiving and sending  channels, as well as reflections from the environment.  The transmitting and receiving paths  (Tξη & Rξη) are on the side surfaces of the cube and respectively represent the transmitting  and receiving planes.  The edges describe the desired direct co -polarization signal paths. 
 The  diagonals describe the unwanted cross -polarization effects, which are caused by the measuri ng  system (e.g. polarization purity of the antenna).  They link the horizontal plane (top surface of  the cube) and the vertical plane (underside of the cube) across the transmitting and receiving  path. 
 The backside of the cube, the so -called object plane,  describes the actual object scatte r- ing matrix [ Sc].  Input magnitudes of the object plane are the co - and cross- polarized signal  paths of the transmitting plane.  Output magnitudes are those scattered from the object into the  receiving plane. 
 The co -polarization scattering parameters Svv and Shh are on the upper and  lower edges of the object plane, while the diagonals represent the cross -polarization param e- ters S vh and S hv.  All signal paths are uni -directional.  .

The determination of the individual paths, meaning Iξη, Tξη and Rξη are based on the meas- urement of reference objects, whose scattering matrix is exactly known.  It is, however, not  possible to individually determine Rξη and Tξη. 
 This is understandable, if one multiplies the  matrix product in Equation (11.11) out and arranges the quadratic matrices in vector form, as  is presented in Equation (11.12).  All measurements result from a product Rξη . Tξη of the  transmitting and receiv ing path.

 This system can be solved according to the coefficients cij by the  measurement of three reference objects wi th known scattering matrices [ Sc1], [Sc2] and [ Sc3].   The single assumption the calibration object, however not the eventual measuring object,  should satisfy the requirement Sci,vh  = Sci,hv  .  This is a very advantageous stipulation, since  objects with defined Svh ≠ Shv, are difficult to realize, at least with monostatic RCS. 
 Neve r- theless, the calibration is valid even when measuring objects with Svh ≠ Shv, i.e. for aniso t- ropic reflectors.

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 100     11.5 Radar Cross -Section of Simple O bjects   The behaviour of the Radar backscattering cross -section as a function of the parameters listed  in section 11.1 is best understood by the consideration of simple bodies, of which will be di s- cussed in the following sections.   11.5.1  Sphere   In practice the sphere is the simplest available scattering body.  Since the sphere offers the  same view from all approaching directions, the back scattering is independent on the rotation  of the sphere. 
 The Radar backscattering cross -section of a sphere is represented in Figure 11.8  as a function of circumference normalized by the wavelength.     Figure 11.8  Radar backscattering cross -section of a sphere (r = s phere radius, λ = wavelength).     Three regions can be clearly distinguished:     € 2πr/λ<<1  The area, in which the sphere circumference is very small compared to the wavelength, is  called the Rayleigh region. 
 Lord Rayleigh investigated the scattering of light  by precipitation  in 1870.  The results apply in the same manner for Radar technology.  In the Rayleigh region  the Radar backscattering cross- section, normalized by the geometric cross -sectional area, is  proportional to r4 and consequently squarely proport ional to the cross -sectional area:  10-110010110210-310-210-1100101   σ πr2=92πr λ0        4  σ πr2=1Rayleigh region Mie orResonanceregionoptical region circumference in wave lengths 2πr/λ  σsphere /πr2. 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 101     € σ πr2=92πr λ0        4  (11.16)  For Radar technology this region is the most interesting, since there is scattering by precipit a- tion of up to approximately 70 GHz in this region.     € 2πr/λ>>1  This region, in w hich the sphere circumference is much larger than the wavelength, is known  as the optical region.  In this region the Radar backscattering cross -section is proportional to  the cross- sectional area  € r2π. 
   € σ πr2=1 (11.17)  For Radar technology this is of interest, since this result corresponds to the definition of the  Radar cross- section.  Theoretically the sphere thus would be the ideal calibration standard for  Radar devices and Radar backscattering cross -sectional measurem ents.  That it is still seldom  used is due to the relatively low reflection capability compared to the physical size. 
 The Radar backscattering cross -section of a sphere of 1 m diameter is .79 m 2 in the optical range.     € 2πr/λ≈1  The range bet ween the two extremes is called the ”Mie“ or resonance region.  Here the Radar  backscattering cross -section is strongly dependent upon frequency. 
 The largest maximum  amounts to approximately 5.7 dB, and the lowest minimum is nearly 4 dB under r 2π.  A sim- ple relationship is however here not stated.  The Radar backscattering cross- section is inde- pendent from the aspect angle, conditional upon the symmetry. 
 The RCS Matrix of the sphere  has the form:  € Ssphere[ ]=Ssphere (f)⋅10 01         (11.18)  The time domain representation in Figure 11.9 shows the Radar pulse response calculated  from the measurements for a sphere with a diameter of 3.6 cm and with 14 GHz bandwidth.  The backscattered wave results from a portion, which is directly reflected on the forefront of  the sphere (optical portion) – first maximum of the impulse response – as well as from a po r- tion, which “creeps” around the sphere (creeping wave).  The distance between both maxima  is calculated to twice the radius of the sphere plus half of the circumfere nce.

As mentioned earlier, spheres, which would be favoura ble from their characteristics, have R a- dar backscattering cross- sections, which are too small.  However, reflectors from Luneburg  lenses have similar characteristics with a considerablely larger Radar backscattering cross - section. 
 Luneburg lenses are sphe rical objects made from individual dielectric shells, whose  refractive index n from outside inward is in accordance with the function:   € n=2−r R0        2 R0=outer radius  (11.23) . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 106       These Luneburg lenses have the property to concentrate an incoming wave at a point of t he  opposite outer side.  If one mounts a reflector there then the signal will be completely reflected in the incident direction. 
 The losses are commonly very small and can be calculated.  The  described property is demonstrated in Figure 11.11.   11.6.2  Corner Refl ectors   As for further calibration standards, so -called corner reflectors are becoming used for scalar  RCS measurements:   Dihedral Corner,   Trihedral Corner. 
 With these corner reflectors the maximum of the re -radiation diagrams is broadly developed. σ  can be  calculated precisely and is large.  Figure 11.12 shows a corner reflector with triangular  side surfaces. 
In Figure 11.13 is a tabular summary of the data for a few reflectors.  A Trih e- dral corner with an edge length of 1 m has a projection area of .58 m2 and a σ of approx i- mately 4500 m2 with a frequency of 10 GHz.      Figure 11.12  Trihedral corners. 
    The re- radiation characteristics are represented in Figure 11.14.  Representative is the distinct  broad maximum.  This is clearly obvious in the three -dimensional r epresentation.

    For a circularly polarized wave the rotational direction changes with each phase shift of the  electrical field strength between righ t-handed circularly and left -handed circularly polarized.   For measurements over 360 ° corner reflectors are bundled into so -called clusters.  Cluster r e- flectors are primarily employed for the marking of position (e.g. 
Ships, balloons, towers, etc.).   Examp les with the corresponding Radar backscattering diagrams are shown in Figure 11.16.     Figure 11.16  “Cluster” reflectors.

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 109     11.7 RCS of Complex Objects   For objects such as airplanes and ships (understood under the term “complex objects”), n u- merous, widespread from one another scattering centres contribute to the Radar scattering  cross- section. Therefore, the RCS pattern can become very irregular. 
Presently, almost excl u- sively just the scalar Radar backscattering cross -section is determined from such objects.   Since calculations are very elaborate, one normally decides for other ways:   Original measurement,   Model measurement,   Simplification or concentration on area of interest for calculation.   A few figures and examples shall point out the mentioned relationships. 
 Figure 11.17 repre- sents the Radar backscattering diagram of an airplane.     Figure 11.17  Measured Radar backscattering diagram of an airplane (B 26), λ = 10 cm,  horizontal polarization.  The fluctuations of σ amount up to 20 dB. 
  Even more striking than the Radar backscattering diagram from airplanes, are those from  ships.  At certain aspect angles huge metal surfaces are orthogonal to the incident waves and  with other angles a mirror reflection results.  The fluctuation levels of RCS are frequently over  30 dB.

Since it is known that one can locate objects with electromagnetic  waves, especially in military applications, possibilities to reduce the Radar backscattering cross- section have been sought.  Earlier even alch emy was looked to for a solution. 
 Today the  possibilities are simple to list after many disappointments due to disillusionment:   Optimization of the shape and style (wideband)   Covering with Radar absorbing material (wideband)   Layering of the outer -surface materials (narrowband)   These three possibilities will be further discussed in the coming sections.   11.8.1  Optimization of Shape and Style   It was shown by the representation of backscattering characteristics of simple bodies that, based upon the projection surface , the sphere had the smallest scattering cross -section, with:   € σKugel=r2π  (11.24)  For bodies with differing curvature in both planes the following applies, where r1 and r2 are the  two radii of curvature:   € σ=r1r2π (11.25)   From this it follows that the radius of curvature is to be minimized.  In these cases, in which  not all aspect angles are expected, one can also consider working with mirrored reflection at  diagonal angles of incidence, as Figure 11.18 shows. 
 . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 10 – Characteristics of Radar Target s 111         Figure 11.18  Exam ple for the optimization of the shape.     The requirements, which are similar to those of good aerodynamics, were particularly realized  with reconnaissance airplanes. 
  11.8.2  Covering with Radar absorbing material   Radar absorbing material (RAM), in order to have a  good absorption characteristic, must have  a minimum depth of approximately half of a wavelength.  Thus this possibility doesn’t exist  for airplanes.  Aboard ships the absorbing coverage is so extremely exposed to the enviro n- ment that the characteristics a re maintained for a longer period of time. 
 Consequently this  possibility remains almost exclusively for use on land.  In practice reductions of 5 and 11 dB have been achieved.   11.8.3  Layering of the Outer -Surface Materials   On the boundary of two dielectrics aris es a reflection due to the ε-discontinuity. 
The aim of  the consideration is to minimize the sum of reflections through the existence of two or more layered reflection locations.  Today in optics these procedures are commonly applied.  It is assumed that:   The wavelength is known,   The wave incidence takes place at a defined angle. 
  Under these assumptions a reduction of up to 20 dB can be achieved.  The creation of a stealth object with materials adapted to the free -space wave- impedance, according to Equation  (11.26), offers no advantages for loss- less materials, since only the phase velocity in the mat e- rial is lowered.  Additionally would the material still have to absorb, since otherwise a refle c- tion takes place on the other side.

 In the military this is known as “Stealth Tec h- nology.”  Reductions of reflection up to 15 dB for a frequenc y range of 8 GHz to 15 GHz  seem possible to be realized.  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  113     12 Selected Areas in Radar Signal Proces sing  In the beginning of Radar technology, signals were not processed in a sophisticated way. 
The  ‘processing’ was acco mplished by systems inherent in the RF - and video subsystems, for  example by filters (integration) or in the display (storage). During the decades a special  ‘culture’ in Radar signal processing was developed, mainly supported by the availabi lity of  digital hardware and during the last years by sof tware. In state of the art Radar systems the  amplified RF- signal is down converted, digitized, software processed and displayed or fed by  automatic processes to other systems like missiles or automobile sy stems (e.g. 
throttle, break,  and collision avoidance Radars). This chapter is intended to give a very short introduction to  Radar signal pro cessing. For special and more detailed information see the literature listed at  the end. 
  12.1 Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)   12.1.1  Introduction   At the output of the signal pro cessing of pulse compression and Doppler processing clutter and  clutter residue can still appear. This interference can obscure target ec hoes and cause false  alarms. Clutter si gnals result from, among other things, rain and snow echoes (i.e. 
rain clutter,  sea clutter from rough sea surfaces) and from signal processing devices (processing clutter).  For example, the range side -lobes from target echoes in pulse co mpression systems.    These types of clutter can be eliminated by appropriate CFAR ( C onstant False Alarm Rate)  methods. 
The basic feature of CFAR is that the false alarm probability remains approximately constant in clutter by a threshold, riding a definite value above clutter. Targets with an echo  power exceeding the threshold level can still be detec ted. The CFAR is completely realized in  digital signal processing. 
 In the following sections different concepts of the CFAR processing  will be shown. An efficient CFAR circuit has to fulfill the following requirements:   Efficient implementation regarding r equired processing power and production costs,   Low CFAR- loss,  Accurate fitting of the CFAR threshold to the clutter scenario,   The CFAR threshold must pass point targets and extended targets,   Closely spaced targets must not mask each other,   The CFAR threshold must follow steep rises (or falls) in background clutter  ampl itude with as little lead (or lag) as possible     12.1.2  The CAGO -CFAR    .

Between the sub -registers, the so - called cell under test (CUT) is located. Each sub -register has its own adding circuit. The larger  of the two sum -values (MAX) is normalized by dividin g it by the number of cells in the sub - register, L. 
Using a multiplicative factor α for linear processing or an additive factor β for  processing with a LOG -amplifier, the threshold value (TV) is calculated. Finally, the ampl i- tude of the signal under test (SUT) is compared with the threshold value to decide whether the  SUT belongs to a target or not.     The CAGO- CFAR has the advantages of requiring little processing power and having low  CFAR loss. 
However, it also has the disadvantage that the thresholding is often ineffective.   The reason for this is that the mean -value calculation inevitably raises the threshold in the  neighbourhood of targets. Consequently, closely spaced targets can mask each other, partic u- larly if a small target is located close to a large  or extended target. 
Fu rthermore, because of the  MAX -process, the CAGO threshold cannot immediately follow an abrupt rise or fall in clutter  level, e.g. the front of a thunderstorm. Therefore the threshold will lead in time in case of a steep rise in clutt er level and will lag in case of a steep fall. 
Both these effects can result in  target losses.  If a summing process (with div ision by 2) replaces the MAX -process of the  CAGO- CFAR, then the CAGO -CFAR results in the so -called C ell Averaging CA- CFAR.

A sorting algorithm arranges the amplitudes of th e storage cells in o rder of decrea s- ing magnitude. 
In a rank- selection process, the “r- th” largest amplitude is chosen as a repre- sentative of the clutter. The TV is calculated using a multiplicative α or add itive factor β as  described for the CAGO- CFAR above. Target detection is accomplished by comparing the  SUT with the TV. 
 In contrast to the CAGO -CFAR, the OS- CFAR has the advantage of effe c- tive thres hold formation, allowing accurate fitting of the threshold in the clutter sc enario.  The OS -CFAR only shows inadequacies in the case of extreme scenarios, where the threshol d- ing process is required to fulfil conflicting requirements. This is because on one hand, a timely  following of jumps in clutter level without undue lead or lag can only be achieved by a rank - selection r ≤  A/2. 
On the other hand, the threshold can only pass accumulations of (extended) . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  116     targets if the rank r is chosen high enough. The major disadvantage of the OS -CFAR is the  high processing power required for performing the sorting alg orithm. 
  The following section shows how the two quite differently structured CFAR algorithms: the  CAGO-  CFAR with its low processing requirements but often ineffective threshol ding and the  OS-CFAR with its effective t hresholding, but heavy processing requir ements for sorting, can  be freely combined.   12.1.4  CAOS -CFAR   The CAGO- CFAR (or the CA -CFAR) can be freely combined with the OS- CFAR.

Moreover, between the CAGO -CFAR and the OS -CFAR any number of intermediate variants  is possible. With regard to the above techniques an optimal CFAR circuit would result if it  would be possible to create a circuit with thresholding at least as effective as that of the OS - CFAR, but with essentially lower processing power requirements.

By  means of a special maximum -minimum process a clu tter-representative sum -value Sr, will be  selected from the “A” sum -values S1 to SA. The threshold value is then calculated using a mu l- tiplicative ( α/L) and/or additive ( β/L) factor.  A number of possibilit ies are possible for implementing the maximum -minimum pro cess. 
For  the CASH- CFAR, a special maximum -minimum circuit is applied. Using this variant, the “A”  sum- values are first halved by a special efficient pair -wise maximum calculation. Then (using  α/L an d or β/L the threshold value results as the smallest of the remaining sum -values. 
 This special maximum- minimum circuit has the favourable characteristic that the resul ting  CASH- CFAR threshold eliminates blocks of interference (rain clutter areas, blocks o f pulse  compression side lobes), exceeding ≥  A*L/2  + L - 1 = b, and co mpletely passes point and e x- tended targets of an extent ≤  A*L/2 - 2 L + 1 = a, almost indepen dently of the number of tar- gets in the CFAR- window. This constitutes an enormous a dvantage of the CASH- CFAR as  opposed to the rank -selection method of the OS -CFAR.  Consequently the use of the CASH- CFAR avoids mutual masking of targets, even taking ta r- get accumulations into consideration. 
The CASH -CFAR threshold very acc urately fits the  clutter sce nario. Moreover, because of the special maximum -minimum process, the threshold  follows steep jumps in clutter level with almost no time displacement. F inally, because of the  selection of the clutter -representative by means of the special maximum -minimum pr ocess the  CASHCFAR requires much less processing power than the OS- CFAR with its rank- selection  method. 
  The processing power requirement can be reduced for the CASH -CFAR by using block pro c- essing in which the threshold is held constant for L values. Thus the threshold value calcul a- tion does not take place in the storage cell raster but only in the sum register raster.  .

The characteristics of the MAMIS -CFAR are quite similar to those of the  CASH- CFAR. For the CFAR -handling of block interference and of point - and extended ta r- gets, in analogy with the CASH -CFAR a = A*L/2 - L - 1 and b = A*L/2 - 1 are valid.   12.1.7  Quality of the CFAR Threshold and CFAR Loss   Now the quality of the several CFAR thresholds will be compared. 
For this pu rpose a sim u- lated sea target scenario in the video domai n, consisting of 15 targets, sea clutter and two rain  areas are considered. In this example the length of the sea targets (ships) is between 20 and  200 m. After the A/D- conversion, the video signal is sampled at a rate of 50 ns, corresponding  to a range resolution cell of 7.5 m. 
The scenario si gnals are passed through the following si m- ple signal processing.   LP A/D LOG CFARvideo signal  Figure 12.7  Signal processing chain for CFAR comparison (low -pass filter (LP), analog -to- digital converter (A/D) including magnitude calculation, loga rithmic amplifier  (LOG) and CFAR algorithm.

Adjusted to the  given sampling rate and range resolution cell size, the length of the CFAR- window is chosen  to be approx imately 120.  .

     Figure 12.13  Sea target scenario and threshold, processed with MAM IS-CFAR (A = 16, L=  8, α = 1, β = 45).   As a first step, the quality of a CFAR threshold is judged considering the above sc enario with  targets and clutter interference (sea clutter, rain areas). For this, we co nsider the sea target sce- nario and the CFAR th resholds documented in Figures 12.8 -12.13. 
The thresholds of the ind i- vidual CFAR algorithms (CFAR -parameter setting α = 1 and β > 0 because of the LOG - amplifier) cause no false alarms, meaning that the signal ampl itudes in the scenario exceed the  CFAR threshold only for targets. Thus, a criterion for the qua lity of the CFAR threshold (i.e.,  the fit of the threshold to the clutter scenario) is given by summing the threshold crossings.  These are defined as     q=s(i)−c(i) [ ] ∑  for all i with s(i) > c(i), wher e s is the scenario and c .

  As a second step, the quality of a CFAR threshold considering a scenario without targets or  clutter, implying a pure Rayleigh -distributed background (resulting in the parameter -settings α  > 0 and β = 0) is evaluated. A criterion for the quality of a CFAR threshold is then given by  the so- called CFAR- loss (LCFAR), defined in [3] as LCFAR [dB] = 20 log10 (E(TC) / TWC), where  TWC is the fixed threshold without CFAR, dependent on the false alarm probability (Pfa), and  E(TC) is the mean -value of the CFAR threshold, also Pfa-dependent.      Figure 12.15  CFAR -Loss LCFAR. 
 Consequently LCFAR is dependent on the Pfa and on the CFAR -parameter settings and thus also  on the length of the CFAR -window. According to the above Figure, the CFAR loss LCFAR of  the individual CFAR methods in dependence on the Pfa for a CFAR- window length of a p- proximately 120. The CFAR loss of the MAMIS -CFAR is higher than that of the CASH - CFAR and LCFAR of the CA -CFAR is insignificantly smaller than that of the CAGO -CFAR. 
In . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  123     general, LCFAR decreases with an increasing CFAR -window length and LCFAR increases with a  decreasing CFAR -window length.  12.1.8  Conclusions   It is possible that the OS -CFAR is combined with the CAGO - and CA- CFAR in a wide range  of ways. 
The resulting CAOS- CFAR provides a threshold with a quality q at least as high as  that of the OS- CFAR and, moreover, the required processing power (for the CAOS -CFAR, we  have a factor -L-reduced sorting alg orithm) and the CFAR loss LCFAR of the CAOS -CFAR are  less than those of the OS- CFAR.  For the MAMIS- CFAR and, in particular, for the CASH -CFAR, the quality q of the CFAR  threshold (threshold fit to the clutter scenario) is significantly higher than for CA -, CAGO- ,  OS- and CAOS- CFAR. The MAMIS-  and CASHCFAR react to changes (rises, falls) in the  interference background quickly and without delay. 
 In comparison, the CA -, CAGO-  and also,  to some extent the OS - and the CAOS- CFAR, react esse ntially more delayed to these clutter  level changes. This is the reason why the CFAR -loss of the CASH -CFAR is a little higher than  that of the other CFAR methods. CFAR adder circuits favorably influence CFAR- loss. 
Since  the MAMIS- CFAR includes no adding process its CFAR -loss (dependent on the CFAR - parameter settings) is higher than that of the CASH -CFAR. Finally, it is noted that the r e- quired processing power for th e MAMIS-  and CASH- CFAR is significantly less than that for  the OS-  and CAOS- CFAR.  References:   [1] F.X.

1998. pp.  12.2 Design of Low Side Lobe Chirp Pulse Compre ssion  12.2.1  Introduction   The increasing use of high duty cycle, solid -state transmitters in modern Radar systems is  making a co mpanion pulse compression subsystem mandatory. 
The availabi lity of digital  waveform synthesis when transmitting, and a digital matched filter approximation when r e- ceiving, are making it possible to synthesize a system with very low mismatch loss, low peak  side lobes, low integrated side lobes, and good Doppler tole rance. Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  124     In this paper waveform design and signal processing, which will result in low range -time side  lobes and a low mismatch loss, are addressed along with the practical co nstraints of the an a- log-to-digital (A/D) conversion process and digital filtering. The r equired A/D converter - sampling rate determines the feasibility and resulting dynamic range of the signal processor  implementation and therefore requires careful attention. 
Other limitations, such as those  caused by transmitter distortion, limited receiver d ynamic range, and other implementation  tolerances also play an important role in reali zing a successful design, but these issues are b e- yond the scope of this paper.  While receiver and signal processor algorithms such as transversal equalizers (or the equiv a- lent) can be used to suppress the range side lobes of almost any pulse compre ssion system,  such techniques usually bring with them an extended filter time -response and have a poor to l- erance  to Doppler shifts of the r eceived returns. The use of single pulse filter banks can im- prove the Doppler tolerance but only at the cost of added pro cessor complexity. 
  In this paper the need to design a transmit waveform, which results in a spectrum with lo w  amplitude ripple, is emphasized. For chirp type waveforms such low ripple designs can be achieved either through the use of a non -linear chirp with a carefully chosen characteristic, or  by slowing the rise - and fall -times of the transmitted chirp, or a c ombination of both. Accurate  control of the rise - and fall -time of a solid -state transmitter is, however, often quite difficult. 
In  the design of the receiver, A/D converter, and digital processing it is also important to perform the major portion of the s pectral weighting in the receiver filters, since this will result in the  lowest possible A/D converter -sampling rate. In the signal processor the phase portion of the  "Matched Filter" operation is performed using either the fast Fourier transform (FFT) or a fi- nite i mpulse response (FIR) filter.  Each of these design processes will be discussed and illustrated by examples. 
A specific de-sign for an S -band Radar with a 100:1 (100  µs to 1µs) non- linear pulse compression system is  presented. For Doppler shifts up to 10  kHz (1000 knots radial v elocity) this design maintains a  peak side lobe level below -55 dB and an integrated side lobe level less than -37.9 dB with a  mismatch loss of 0.6 dB. The receiver uses a 5- pole Bessel filter with a 0.7 MHz bandwidth,  the A/D converter sampling rate is 2.5  MHz, and the FIR filter pulse compressor has an i m- pulse response duration which exceeds the Radar pulse -length by only 35%. 
The mismatch  loss is less than 0.1 dB at zero Doppler.     Figure 12.16  Linear Chirp pulse compression system.  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  125          Figure 12.17  Spectrum of 1.37  MHz linear Chirp and Gaussian weighting function designed  for 45  dB side lobes.   12.2.2  Linear and Nonlinear Chirp Waveforms   When the classical linear chirp waveform is used in Radar, additional weighting in the fr e- quency or time domain must be added to the matched filtering, as shown in Figure  12.16, in  order to obtain acceptable side lobes [1, 2]. As an example, the spectrum of a 100 µs linear  chirp is shown in Figure 12.17 together with a Gaussian weigh ting filter designed to provide  45 dB side lobes. 
A total chirp bandwidth of 1.37 MHz is used to obtain a compressed pulse- width of 1µs after weighting and rise - and fall -times of 1  µs are a ssumed. Figure 12.18 shows  the pulse compressed output for a matched filter r eceiver alone (gray curve) and with the addi- tional Gaussian weighting filter added to the matched filter. At the frequency limits of the lin-ear chirp (0.685  MHz) the required r esponse of the Gaussian filter is –26 dB down. 
The need  for a weighting filter is the result of the near -rectangular spectrum generated by the linear  chirp. For the case described above, the use of weighting to reduce the pulse compression side lobes introduce s a mismatch loss of 1.48  dB. The output side lobe levels can be i mproved  somewhat if the matched filter in Figure 12.16 is replaced by the phase -only ve rsion (constant  amplitude response) when used in conjunction with the Gaussian weighting filter (see [1 ],  Figure 9 and 10). 
The compressed output for this case is shown in Figure 12.19 resulting in an improvement of about 6 dB. This example demonstrates that amplitude variations in the signal  spectrum should not be replicated in the digital pulse co mpression filter.  Based on the principle of stationary phase, which states that for 'slow' sweep rates, the spectral  energy due to a swept signal will be inversely proportional to the rate of sweep, numerous  studies and impleme ntations have been pursued, where the  rate of sweep has been made to  match the inverse of Taylor or Gaussian functions [3 -6]. 
This approach is generally successful  in reducing the amount of required weighting and ther efore the resulting mismatch loss, but  the residual Fresnel ripple in the sp ectrum often limits the resulting pulse compre ssion side  lobes [7]. Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  126          Figure 12.18  Matched filter compressed output (gray) and matched filter with added  Gaussian weighting.       Figure 12.19  Compressed output using phase -only matched filter with Gaussian wei ghting  filter. 
  It is well known that slowing the rise - and fall -times of the transmitted pulse envelope can  reduce the amount of ripple in the signal spectrum, but this approach is often tec hnologically  difficult to implement in Radar transmitters, and wi ll result in reduced transmitter efficiency.  However, some slowing of the rise - and fall -times is always r equired to meet spectrum control  requirements and for this reason a 1 µs rise-  and fall -time was assumed for the waveform d e- signs presented in this pap er. Several papers have reco gnized that low spectral ripple, nonli n- ear chirp waveform designs can be achieved for low time- bandwidth products by adding very  rapid frequency excu rsions at the start and end of the chirp waveform [8 -9]. 
In particular, the  paper by Price [8] discusses the "circle -φ" nonlinear frequency modulation, which results in  extremely low side lobes at the output of a matched filter. This paper uses this type of non - linear frequency chirp, supe rimposed on a conventional linear chirp, as proposed by Price, to . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  127     achieve a practic al compromise between mismatch loss, time side lobes, and spectral sprea d- ing of the transmitted signal. 
  12.2.3  Nonlinear Chirp Based on the Circle -φ Fun ction  Based on the "circle -φ" nonlinear chirp proposed by Price [8] the class of waveforms consi d- ered in this p aper have a frequency versus time characteristic given by the follo wing equation:   € f(t)=1 2BL⋅x+BC 2x 1−x2−1<x<1 where x=2t T−T 2<t<T 2 (12.1)  In these equations BL is the total sweep of the linear chirp component and Bc is the total fre- quency extent of a straight line which has the sa me slope as the circular term at x=0. An ex- ample of this type of non -linear chirp waveform is shown in Figure 12.20 for the sp ecific pa- rameters used later in this paper. The chirp duration is 100  µs with BL = 0.55 MHz and  Bc = 0.18 MHz, and the rise-  and fall- times are 1 µs. 
    Figure 12.20  Non-linear chirp based on the sum of linear chirp and circle -φ chirp.   The corresponding signal amplitude spectrum is shown in Figure 12.21 along with the ampl i- tude characte ristic of a 5 -pole Bessel filter having a 3- dB bandwidth of 0.7  MHz (dotted  curve) as used in the pulse co mpression implementation example below. The matched filter  output corresponding to this nonlinear chirp is shown in Figure 12.22 and the im provement  relative to the linear chirp case in Figure 12.18 is substantial. 
When the matched filter is r e- placed with a combination of the 5- pole, 0.7 MHz Bessel filter and a phase -only matched fil- ter, the output shown in Figure 12.23 is obtained. While the  mismatch loss is slightly i ncreased  to 0.045 dB, the side lobe level beyond 4 µs from the peak is now below -50.9 dB. The inte- grated side lobe level outside ±4  µs from the peak is less than -41.8 dB. 
The shoulders on the  response with peaks at -32 to - 33 dB would hardly affect any real aspect of Radar perfor m- ance.  .

  12.2.4  Receiver and Signal Processor Considerations   Today most Radar receivers use digital signal processing. A generic block diagram of  such a  Radar receiver is shown in Figure 12.24.     Figure 12.24  Digital implementation of non -linear chirp pulse compression. 
  As much as possible of the amplitude weighting should be placed in the analog filter in order  to minimize the required A/D conve rter sampling rate and the pulse compression and any  equalization should be performed by the digital signal processor after A/D co nversion.  A digital implementation of pulse compression places a more stringent requirement on the A/D conversion rate than mo re conventional DSP applications (Even more difficult AID sa m- pling rate requirements are imposed by the use of direct sampling where alia sing must be kept  at a very low level). In Figure  12.25 an example is shown, where a 1.5 MHz complex sa m- pling rate is used between the Bessel filter and the phase -only Matched filter as considered in  Figure 12.23. 
It is seen that this sampling rate is having a noticeable effect on the time re-sponse of the pulse compression system. From the Bessel filter response shown in F ig- ure 12.21 it is seen that a 1.5 MHz sampling rate will result in aliasing at the –18 dB level. At  an A/D sampling rate of 2.5 MHz the response would become almost the same as in an alog  processing case. 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  130          Figure 12.25  Non-linear chirp compressed output us ing Bessel filter, phase -only matched  filter, and 1.5  MHz A/D conversion.   12.2.5  Design Example   When implementing digital filters it becomes possible to compensate for spectral ripples and  thus to improve the resulting pulse compression side lobes. The character istics of such "reci p- rocal ripple" filters [9- 10] are most easily visualized in the frequency domain. 
The fundame n- tal idea is to add a reciprocal ripple filter in series with the phase -only matched filter, such that  spectral ripple in the signal is cancell ed, as represented in Figure 12.26. The gray curve shows  the signal spectrum and the black curve is the combined response of the Bessel filter and r e- ciprocal ripple filter. It can be seen that the total filter response exactly counters the residual  spectra l ripple with the result that the signal spectrum at its output has a smooth chara cteristic  as shown in Figure 12.27. 
While the compressed output obtained with the recipr ocal ripple  filtering, shown in Figure 12.26, would provide extremely low side lobe, t his performance  would be unachievable in practice, because the required filtering implies an infinite impulse response. The duration of this impulse response must be taken into a ccount regardless of  whether pulse compression is performed with a finite leng th FIR filter, or whether it is based  on the FFT approach. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the use of a phase -only matched filter  will also result in an extended duration impulse response. 
The FIR impulse response of the  combin ation of the reciprocal ripp le filter and the phase -only Matched filter as described  above is shown in Figure  12.28 (gray curve) together with a version of this filter, which has  been truncated to a total of 337 taps corresponding to a total r esponse time of 135 µs. This only  exceeds the Matched filter implementation (250 taps) by 35%. The co mpressed output resul t- ing from the use of this truncated filter is shown in Figure  12.29. 
A side lobe level less than - 65 dB is realized and could be improved by an increased length FIR filter impl ementation. The  3-dB width of the compressed pulse is 0.941 µs and the int egrated side lobe level outside +4  dB is- 50.3 dB. The mismatch loss is 0.063  dB.

Figure 12.27  Amplitudes of FIR weights of exact phase -only Matched filter plus reciprocal  ripple filter and truncated version used to obtain output response in  Figure  12.29 and 12.30. 
  The issue of Do ppler sensitivity was finally considered as shown in Figure  12.30 where a  10 kHz Doppler shift was added to the signal. At S -band this Doppler shift represents a radial  target velocity of 1000knots. For this Doppler shift side lobes have increased but are still b e- low the -55 dB level, while the mismatch loss has increased to 0.59  dB. 
In spite of its non- linear characteristic this waveform has retained the good Doppler tole rance of the linear chirp.  .

      Figure 12.29  Compressed output as in Figure 12.28 but with 10 kHz Doppler shift.   12.2.6  Results   The design process of low -loss, low -side lobe, non- linear chirp pulse- compression systems,  along with considerations for its practical implementation as part of a digital si gnal processing  system, needs to include at least the fo llowing:  Determine the necessary and achievable rise - and fall- times of the transmi tted  waveform, which will meet sp ectrum control requirements.   Develop a signal design, which achieves the desired spectral shaping to minimize  processing losses, while minimizing spectral ripple. 
 . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 11 – Selected Areas in Radar Signal Processing  133     Design the receiver/processor using a close approximation to a Matched fi lter in order  to min imize mismatch loss.   Place most (or all) of the amplitude weighting in the analog receiver portion of the  system. 
This minimizes the required A/D converter -sampling rate.   Do not double the spectral ripple by including the amplitude characteristics of the  matched filter.  This could degrade the achievable time side lobes by as much as 6  dB. 
Use only the phase characteristic of the matched filter and replace its amplitude response with a smoothed function in the analog portion of the receiver.  Perform trade- off of required digital filter transient response.  If necessary add a reciprocal ripple inverse filter to further reduce range time side  lobes. 
Keep in mind that this may result in greater Doppler sens itivity. Re -consider  the required digital filter transie nt response.  Determine required A/D converter sampling rate. 
Iterate the receiver filter design to  reduce aliasing at a minimal cost in pulse compression perfor mance.  Finally any such design needs to be evaluated relative to implementation tolerances and v aria- tions in transmitter distortion versus frequency, or from module to module, in order to verify  the practicality of the design.

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 12 – Selected Radar Applications  135     13 Selected Radar Applications   13.1 Tracking Radar   The exact position of the target is required for a few applications of Radar technology. 
 Some  examp les are airspace surveillance, linking with spacecraft and/or satellites, or for use in mil i- tary applications.  The accuracy of the angle position (≈  θHB/2), attainable with the directivity  of the antenna, is not sufficient.  The measurement of Δx of an ob ject over the resolution at a  range R, realizable by the half -power bandwidth ΘHB of the a ntenna, is large for greater dis- tances. 
  € Δx=θHB⋅R (13.1)  A value of Δx ≈ 17,3 m results for ΘHB =1° at a range of 1 km.  To improve this various proc e- dures for pivoting or rotating antennas have been developed for target scanning.  This includes  all scanning procedures, such as Conical Scanning, and directivity -switching procedures, such  as Sequential Lobing. 
 These procedures are relatively time consumin g, since they are serially  operated.  A considerably faster procedure, which operates as a parallel process, is the M o- nopulse Procedure.  13.2 Monopulse Radar   The so -called Monopulse Procedure makes possible a considerable improvement. 
 At first the  name is some what misleading.  It signifies the possibility to already determine the target with  one pulse.  As almost always there are, as normal, a vast number of pulses to integrate for i m- proving the signal- to-noise ratio. 
 Now and again this procedure is also refer red to Simultane- ous Lobing.  From this it is possible to recognize the implementation: several directivity pa t- terns are radiated at the same time.  If this takes place with an antenna then one refers to the Amplitude Monopulse Procedure. 
 If two locally separated antennas are used then one no r- mally realizes the so- called Phase Monopulse Procedure.  The Amplitude Monopulse Proc e- dure will soon be described in more depth.  The antenna of amplitude monopulse Radar rad i- ates for determining the respective target angles θ und ψ of two separate, however correlated  directivity patterns. 
 This is illustrated in Figure 13.1.  . Radar System Engineering  Chapter 12 – Selected Radar Applications  136     -0,4-0,200,20,40,60,811,2 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15Beam 1 Beam 2   θ         Figure 13.1  Example directivity patterns of monopulse Radar in the θ and ψ planes, intercept  points 3 dB.

With phase controlled antennas the four  patterns can be realized by four different, however, simultaneous allocations.

 By overlapping the individual directivity patterns  at the 3 dB points, the achieved normalized sum is  € 2. The difference diagrams (beam 1 –  beam 2) are of particular interest for the determination of the directivity.  This has a nearly  linear progression from –1 to +1 between both maximums of the individual directivity pa t- terns. 
 This range, with an example dynamic of 2x25 dB = 50 dB, is available for the higher  resolution of the angle between both individual directivity patterns, e.g. 2°.  Newer monopulse  Radar devices have these difference curves stored in look -up tables. 
 An improvement of the  angle resolution of better than .02° is easily possible.

Radar System Engineering  Chapter 12 – Selected Radar Applications  141     13.3 Automotive Radar (ACC)   13.3.1  History   The first ideas to use Radar devices in vehicles date back to the 1950’s.  Radar devices are  generally attractive for vehicles, since they are able to determine the distance and velocity of  other objects, regardless of weather.  General Motors realized the first integrati on in 1959 in  the Cadillac Cyclone [GM], Figure 13.9. 
 Behind the smooth, black plastic horns is hidden a  modified airplane Radar.  The distance to the approaching vehicle and the braking distance are  indicated on the instrument panel.     Figure 13.9  Radar in the 1959 Cadillac Cyclone. 
    Radar was still constructed with tube technology and with very simple target extraction.  The Microprocessors and digital signal processing of the mid 1970’s brought about a boom in the  development of Radar instrumentation.  This made possible the considerable size reduction of  instruments for microwave technology. 
 The first Radar to be constructed completely with  transistors is described in [LiW], and operated at 35 GHz.  It operated in pulse mode with a resolution of approximately 2m.  The frequency for this was internationally coordinated at the  beginning of the 1970’s. 
 Gunn elements were used in the oscillators.  The device had only one  main beam direction.  Sample lines were constructed on various occasions, but it was recog- nizable that no cost -effective manufacturing was to be expected. 
  This only came about in the mid 1990’s with the availability of MMIC’s ( M onolithic Micro- wave Integrated Circuits), which allowed for higher level of integration.  As a main applic a- tion the automatic distance control appeared in the sense of an intelligent cruise control system (AICC Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Control; ACC Adaptive Cruise Control; ICC Intelligent  Cruise Control).  . 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 12 – Selected Radar Applications  142        Figure 13.10  ACC Radar sensors for highway and street traffic (Courtesy A.D.C.).     Since then the frequency range from 76 GHz to 77GHz has been licensed in Europe, the USA  and in Japan (Technical Standard EN301091 V1.1.1, ETSI) for the use in ACC.  The first s e- ries installation took place with the S -class from Mercedes at the beginning of 1999. 
 Nearly  all such Radar devices of this recent generation possess three horizontal antenna beams of  around 3° each.  The typical range is indicated as 150 m for objects with 1  m2 Radar cross - section.  The direction of th e acquired target is determined with a mono -pulse procedure. 
 The  data processing is usually so applied that a certain number of point targets in the distance (> 32) and the stored angles (history) are tracked and are evaluated in their significance for th e  same lane as the traveling automobile.  For range determination almost all well -known proce- dures are employed, such as Pulse Radar, FM -CW, Pseudo Noise and Multifrequency CW  procedures, whereby the FM -CW is the most frequently used procedure.  The antenn as are  usually quasi -optically formed and the individual directivities are switched electronically. 
 The  processing forms the main part of the devices.  In 2000 their size was approximately 10x10x10 cm 3.  The vision for 2010 is one of transportation support ed by several Radar sensors, as shown in  Figure 13.10 and 13.11. 
 Radar sensors are used apart from the distance and obstacle controls in the range up to 250 m and eventually will be used additionally for close -range sensing to  approximately 5 m (city traffic, airbag sensors, etc.), used as impact sensors (airbags, seatbelt control), for complete angle sensing (lane changing), and so forth.  It is anticipated that close - range sensing will be controlled with sensors operating at 24 GHz.  A drastic drop in pr ice is  also expected in the coming years. 
 It is expected that legal regulations for the installation of these systems in buses and heavy transport will be first.  This is likewise expected with rail - mounted vehicles.  It is also considered possible that t he number of accidents will decrease .

In the long -term prices will probably sink to the same price level as car  radios.    Figure 13.11  Vision  of transportation and traffic supported by Radar sensors (Courtesy  A.D.C.). 
  13.3.2  Automobile Radar System Parameters   13.3.2.1  Coverage   The area in front of the vehicle, which is around 1.5 the breaking distance, is identified as the  collision region.  The neighbouring lanes, left and right, are also considered and the functio n- ing of such a Radar system must also guarantee safety when driving in the curves.  This is  shown for a section of straight road in Figure 13.12. 
 The lane width of streets is normally around 3 – 3.4 m.  Thus there is an angular range of ±5°, which must be additionally acquired  during curving.  Presently the antenna patterns are not adjusted with the turning of the steering wheel. 
Radar System Engineering  Chapter 12 – Selected Radar Applications  144        Figure 13.12  Coverage of an ACC sensor (Courtesy A.D.C.)     Today the collision region is normally covered by 3 radiated beams, which are sequentially switched.  A further field of vision is required in the near region, e.g. during city driving for  the acquisition and detection of incoming traffic from the sides and perpend icular directions. 
  This near field sensing is illustrated in Figure 13.13.  The near field is also referred as the cut - in zone and here a higher resolution is required than in the far field.  At present the ACC R a- dar detectors do not provide special measu res for a particular detection or acquisition at close  range. 
   Figure 13.13  Coverage of an ACC sensor with close -range sensing (Courtesy A.D.C.)   13.3.2.2  Antenna Design   Today dielectric lenses are almost exclusively used for ACC Radar sensors.  In a few cases are   these full lenses and in other cases layered lenses.  There are also well -known antennas with  polarized lattices having double reflection at 45°. 
 The price will be crucial for the future.  The  lenses are excited by patch -antennas (λ/2 emitter) or by diel ectric shaft emitter.  The polariz a-.

The 3 dB width of the antenna characteristic is today between 2° and 3°.  The three directi v- ities overlap each other at the 3 dB points. 
 The correlation for a cos2 allocation (side lobes <  32 dB) is represented in Figure 13.14.  In practice side lobes < 25 dB are required.  After an antenna width of approximately 110 mm a half -power bandwidth of around 3° results.

  13.3.3  Circuit and Switching Concepts   The main components of an ACC Radar sensor are:   RF frontend  Signal processing   Vehicle interface   The RF frontend contains the oscillator, the transmitting/rece iving duplexer and the receiver.   Today the oscillators are normally constructed at frequencies of 19 GHz or 38 GHz with d u- plication or triplication.  The pulse modulation takes place via the switching. 
 With FM mod u- lation the FM pass is added.  For the tr ansmitting/receiving duplexer 6x λ/4 hybrids are used.   These lead a priori to a loss of over 6 dB. 
 The receiver is constructed as a “push -pull” mixer.   The sample takes place in the baseband.         Figure 13.15  Block diagram of an ACC Radar sensor. 
      There are very differing implementations for the individual function blocks.  Examples will be shown in the proceeding sections.  .

  A considerably higher integration can b e achieved using MMICS.  A large advantage is the  reduction of the millimeter -wave connections.  With that there is an increase in the reliability  and a reduction of the line losses. 
  13.3.4  Modulation Procedures   As is represented above are presently very many dif ferent modulation procedures used.  The  most successful will be that form of modulation, which best handles multiple targets.   13.3.4.1  FM-CW Modulation Procedures   The most frequently used modulation procedure is FM -CW. 
 As a rule a trapezoidal modula- tion is used, s ince it most simply allows for the determination of range and velocity.  Since it,  however, is not always unique, two or several different trapezoids are sent in succession.  The  varying edges are chosen to increase the uniqueness. 
 This also results in va rious “beat fre- quencies” for identical targets, a fact that can also be exploited.     Figure 13.18  Typical double -trapezoidal modulation for ACC sensors.   13.3.4.2  FSK Procedure   FSK modulation procedures are similar to the instrumentation Radar procedure from Radar  measuring technology. 
 The large advantage is the extremely high sensitivity due to the narrow  bandwidth.  The analysis is almost exclusively based on phase and phase difference measur e- ments.  Problems can arise with targets having a velocity difference of  zero.

The core task  emerges from the structure of the data history, somewhat of a development of the target or  relevant object.  Only with this  can it be decided, for example, if there is an object on the road  or perhaps on the side of the road during a curve. 
 Bridges can also be distinguished as rel e- vant objects.  The resolution of an A/D converter could be around 12 bits.  Depending on the  procedure it is possible to carry out multiple transformations and filtrations.

 A  few are here listed:   Still Object Recognition:  Stationary objects have the same characteristics as objects on the  sides of the roads or bridges.  They are distinguished only by their history, meaning that it is  recognized somewhat late whether the objects  represent dangers or not.   Detection with vrel = 0:  With FM -CW sensor there can be problems for objects which move  very quickly, where vrel = 0, since the velocity value zero is difficult to measure. 
  Multiple Objects:  A large number of objects leads to “ processing artifacts” for FM -CW sen- sors with FFT- Processing under certain conditions.  Normally these can be identified and ver i- fied by using the history.  Mechanical Stability: The integration must have the necessary precision for millimetre wave  technolog y. 
 In particular this means that the alignment be exact by 0.1°.   Sensor Blindness Recognition:  The function of the sensors must be continually checked to  ensure the immediate detection of sensor blindness due to wetness, snow, dirt, pollution, d e- fect, etc.  .

 This is achieved by a feeding network, which allows a specific influence of  the phase and/or the amplitude for each individual element and/or sub -array of the entire array.   With the appe aring monostatic Radar devices, since the same antenna groups for transmitting  and receiving are predominantly used, the transmitting and receiving paths must be additio n- ally separately switchable.  The named functions are made available by the so -called T rans- mit/Receive (T/R) modules, which are embedded into the system according to Figure 13.26.

Radar System Engine ering  Chapter 13 – Future Radar Systems  162     14 Future Radar Systems  Rece nt advances in RF, microwave, digital and software technology will allow the development  of software -defined Radar sensors (SDRS) in the near future. The functio nality and system pa- rameters of Radar sensors for remote sensing applications will no longer be  implemented in  hardware, but instead in downloadable software. 
 Software- defined SAR (SD -SAR) is especially  suited for these developments.  In this short article, I will outline the e nvisioned functionality,  structure and features of software- defined Radar sensors.  The vision is not new: Connect the  antenna output to an A/D converter and process the signals dig itally. 
This vision may now b e- come possible and extend far beyond what was previously imagined.  Synthetic aperture Radar is  an especially a ppropriate candidate to explain and demonstrate the future.   14.1 The Transmit Subsystem   Currently transmit subsystems are mainly implemented using one of the following princ iples:  Pulsed- FM synthesizer -  high power amplifier - reflector antenna   Pulsed- FM synthesizer -  high power amplifier - beam forming network -  fixed array  Pulsed- FM synthesizer -  feed network -  transmit/receive modules - radiating el ements  The first two of these alternatives are completely inflexible. 
They seldom allow transmit fr e- quency agility and changes in the radiated beam. Transmit/Receive (T/R) modules are typically  associated with the use of phased arrays, spot beams and distributed power gener ation. Several  feed or beam -forming networks are required. 
Spot beams inherently imply loss of covera ge, and  the overall power efficiency is quite low. The antenna sy stems have large space and weight re- quirements, and necessitate large -area solar panels for power generation. Nevertheless, SAR- systems with T/R modules are the best avai lable with the presen t technology and will continue to  be launched during the next few years. 
  The vision of the future is that Radar and synthetic aperture transmitters will be implemented as  arrays of modules, each one composed of:   DDS (Direct Digital Synthesizer) up -converte r, medium power amplifier antenna as  shown in Figure 14.1    Direct Digital Synthesizer Configura - tionSoftwarePre- amplifi - erMixerLow loss antenna High Efficien - cyPower AmplifierHPA   Figure 14.1  Block diagram of a single channel SDRS transmit subsystem    . Radar System Engine ering  Chapter 13 – Future Radar Systems  163     These modular transmit subsystems can be arranged to arrays much more flexible than Phased  arrays because of the simple and  only digital control. In addition a true time delay can easy be  digitally controlled. 
An array is shown in the next figure.     Pre -amplifi - er Configura - tionSoftwareDirect Digital SynthesizerMixer HPA Pre- amplifierDirect Digital SynthesizerMixer HPA   Figure 14.2  Block diagram for SDRS transmit subsystem.     DDSs are now available on the market with frequencies up to almost 1 GH z, more than sufficient  for most applications. 
 They can generate nearly any arbitrary waveform and pr ovide full versatil- ity in amplitude, phase, and spectrum.  Complex waveforms can be with FM, PM, or AM mod u- lation can be generated, as well as coding sche mes such as pseudo noise (PN), CDMA, etc. Even  multi -carrier waveforms are possible, all using only downloadable software. 
Spectrally efficient  modulation and convolutional codes are of sp ecial interest. The SDRS implementation makes  sensor transmitters hi ghly flexible and modular. Using an up -converter, the DDS frequency range  can be transposed to any frequency band used by SAR for remote sensing. 
The limiting comp o- nents will be the m edium power amplifier and the antenna elements. Using wideband comp o- nents (antennas, mixers, amplifiers, etc.), a wide variety of spectral transmit modes, e.g. narrow- band, wideband, and multi- carrier, are possible. 
 In the same manner single -beam, wide- beam,  spot- beam, and multi -beam are possible.  Because of modularity, transm itters of different sizes as  well as different number of elements can easily be configured baseband si gnals.  Control and  power supply lines are the only connections to each module. 
  Conformal schemes and adaptation  to satellites, aircraft and other platf orms are more readily realizable.   14.2 The Receiver Subsystem   The receivers of software defined Radar sensors have similar configurations and stru ctures to that  of the transmitters. Both may use the same antenna. 
The configuration of one channel is rather simple.  Figure 14.3 shows the configuration.    .

The sub- system is comprised of:  Antenna   Filter   Low- noise amplifier   Downconverter  A/D converter   The entire antenna consists of an arra y of these channels.  The same flexibility that a pplies to the  transmit elements also applies to the receiver. 
 Amplitude, phase and, to a limited extent, co u- pling can be corrected during the processing. The restrictions that us ually apply to phased arrays   will be relaxed, because the coherence and phase relatio nships will be during post- processing and  calibration. These receive systems will have a lower noise figure than standard phased array r e- ceivers, because the phase shifters are eliminated. 
The necess ity of a down- converter is dete r- mined by the available A/D -converter. The digital output of each receiver channel is directly fed  to dedicated proce ssors. The processing modes are adapted to the transmit modes by downloa d- able software and they can be modif ied with changes in the sensor/target positions, the required  specifications in resolution, and the depth of processing. 
 Radar engineers can learn a great deal  from their communications colleagues who realize similar concepts for sof tware- defined radios  (SDR). In the future, the processing needs for communications are comparable to remote sensing  or even higher.   14.3 SDRS and SD -SAR System Aspects   Because the entire functionality of this new type of software -defined Radar sensors can be dow n- loaded, their operat ing modes may be multifunctional, selective, active, pa ssive and corrective. 
  In addition to their typical Radar function, they may operate as radiometers, for communication or even as electronic warfare transmitters.  Several components and subsystems of these envi-. Radar System Engine ering  Chapter 13 – Future Radar Systems  165     sioned software- defined Radar sensors are already under develo pment. 
 Prices and power co n- sumption are still high, but, like those of most digital har dware, they will plummet. Appropriate  antennas with excellent features, wide bandwidths, dual p olarization and low loss are under d e- velopment.  Digital beam forming on receive only is one of the top R&D areas for the third and  fourth generations of mobile communications. 
Sim ilarly, multifunctional software -defined radios  (SDR), fulfilling the process ing needs of diffe rent mobile communications standards and ser v- ices, are under development at many places worldwide. SDRS and SD -SAR will benefit from  them.   The future of Radar remote sensing hardware will be digital. 
 Several key digital projects in the past have been successful.  The functionality of software -defined sensors will be downloaded or  stored according to the actual requirements. Because of their modular structure, these systems will be more readily available, with shorter production times and by far lower prices. 
 Software- defined Radar sensors will make microwave remote sen sing more affordable in the future. The  functionality may even be user -implemented.  One should not be afraid of this dramatic yet e x- pected change in our research field in the f uture. 
 There will be still the need for scientists, RF,  microwave, digital and software eng ineers.  Also required will be antennas, microwave semico n- ductors, digital hardware and software, and last but not least, platform d evelopment.    .
