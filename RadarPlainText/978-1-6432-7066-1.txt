These aircraft undertake long-range maritime patrol duties that typicallyinclude anti-surface warfare (ASuW), anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and search and rescue (SAR).
They carry a wide variety of sensors, communications equipment and weapons.
In most cases a prime sensor is the airborne maritime surveillanceradar, intended to detect small targets on the sea surface in high sea states and to monitor surface vessels at long ranges.
The ﬁrst operational system was developed in the UK for the RAF at the start of WWII.
Since then there has been a continuousevolution of technology and capability, which still continues today in many countries.
This book describes the evolution of airborne maritime surveillance radars from a British perspective.
Having undertaken research into the design of airborne maritime reconnaissance radar systems during my professional career I wished to understand the technical history of these systems.
There are many excellent memoires of the people involvedin early development of these radars during WWII, but little technical detail on the design, operation and performance of these systems has been published.
Radar ﬁrst entered front-line service for maritime reconnaissance at the start of WWII, toprovide long-range monitoring of surface ships and, most importantly, as a key component in the battle against the growing German U-boat threat.
At that time the term ‘radar ’had not been adopted and these systems were known as Air-to-Surface Vessel (ASV).
The ﬁrst system, building on experiment work undertaken in the late 1930s, was ASV Mk.
I, which entered service in early 1940.
These ﬁrst airborne radars were quite primitive by modern standards but made an immediate impact onthe conduct of naval warfare.
Over the next ﬁve years of war there was an extraordinary development in technology, both in the UK and in the USA.
ASV went from simple systems operating at VHF through to complex microwave radars.
By the end of WWII very many thousands of ASV systems had been manufactured and RAF Coastal Command had a total establishment of over 1000 maritimereconnaissance aircraft in a wide variety of roles, but all ﬁtted with ASV radar.
In this volume, I describe the main ASV radars developed in the UK during WWII for the RAF.
Each radar is described in terms of its hardware, its radar characteristicsand the performance achieved.
This information has been gleaned from the technical manuals of the time, the Air Publications, and many contemporaneous reports issued by TRE and the various RAF trials organisations.
The radars developed inthe USA, also ﬂown by the RAF on American aircraft, and the radars developed for the RN Fleet Air Arm are also covered in the book, but in less detail.
In a companion volume to this book I describe how this war-time work was continued in the UK with the development of airborne maritime surveillance radars for the RAF, up to the beginning of the twenty- ﬁrst century.
x ASV radars played a very important role in the battle against the U-boats in WWII and their modern successors continue to be developed to this day.
I hope that readers of this book will gain an insight into the fascinating technology develop-ments and achievements in this ﬁeld.

Such radars were ﬁrst developed in the UK during WWII, as part of the response to the threat to shipping from German U-boats.
The U-boat was a potent weapon and constituted a major threat to the Allied war effort.
In the Atlantic they made full use of the space of the ocean, bad weather, poor visibility and darkness to obtain an advantage.
Detection of U-boats in suchconditions was a prerequisite to any countermeasures.
ASV for the detection of surfaced vessels from the air gave at least a partial answer and had a signi ﬁcant impact on the conduct of naval warfare from that time [ 1].
This book describes the ASV radars developed in the UK and used by RAF Coastal Command during WWII for long-range maritime surveillance.
1.2 RAF Coastal Command RAF Coastal Command was the user of all the radars described in this book.
It was set up in 1936, having previously been known as the coastal area of the RAF.
On 1stSeptember 1937 its role was de ﬁned in an Air Ministry Directive to the Air Of ﬁcer Commanding-in-Chief as ‘trade protection, reconnaissance and co-operation with the Royal Navy ’.
The provision of airborne reconnaissance reports of surface ships was a key requirement and this could be seriously hampered by poor visibility, bad weather and darkness.
The advent of radar to detect our own ships and to ﬁnd and ﬁght the enemy at sea would bring about major changes in the function of aircraft in maritime warfare.
A comprehensive history of Coastal Command is given in the book by C Ashworth [ 2] and the story of its wartime years is given in the book by A Hendrie doi:10.1088/978-1-6432-7066-1ch1 1-1 ªMorgan & Claypool Publishers 2018 [3].
In September 1939, at the start of WWII, Coastal Command had 19 squadrons, ﬂying Anson, Vildebeest, Hudson, London, Stranraer and Sunderland aircraft, with a total establishment of 242 aircraft [ 3].
Many of these aircraft were obsolete and, apart from the Hudsons and Sunderlands, not suitable for the anti U-boat role that was to come.
By April 1945, the Coastal Command battle line comprised an establishment of over 1000 aircraft, from 54 RAF squadrons and 6 USN, 1 SAAF and 2 FAA squadrons under Coastal Command control.
The aircraft included Liberator, Wellington, Sunderland, Catalina, Barracuda, Beau ﬁghter, Mosquito, Anson, Warwick, Spit ﬁre, Walrus, Sea Otter, Hurricane, Fortress, Halifax and Hudson [ 1,3].
Coastal Command ’s principle roles were Anti-Submarine Warfare and Anti Shipping operations, but there were also squadrons specialising in Air-SeaRescue, Meteorological Flights and Photo-Reconnaissance.
1.3 Airborne radar development and trials organisations To understand the development and contribution of the early ASV radars, it isnecessary not only to understand how they worked but also to critically assess how well they worked.
Throughout WWII these radars were being tested and evaluated, both in order to improve their design and maintenance and also to developappropriate strategies for their use.
A number of different research, development and trials organisations are mentioned throughout the book.
A brief summary of these is given here and further details of their work will be found in the relevant chapters.
The ﬁrst work on airborne radar was undertaken at the Bawdsey Research Station, at Bawdsey Manor in Suffolk [ 5–7],ﬂying from Martlesham Heath.
At the outbreak of war the team, now part of the Air Ministry Research Establishment (AMRE), moved ﬁrst to Perth and then, in October 1939, to RAF St Athan.
RAF St Athan was home to 32 Maintenance Unit (No.
32 MU), which had been given the task of installing the newly developed ASV and AI radars into Hudson and Blenhe im aircraft, respectively [ 4].
No.
32 MU was subsequently involved with developing installations of new ASV radars in differ- ent aircraft throughout WWII.
In 1940, AMRE, now called the Ministry of Aircraft Production Research Establishment (MAPRE), moved to Worth Matravers, near Swanage in Dorset.
The name of this organisation was further changed to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in November 1940, still part of the Air Ministry.
InMay 1942 TRE moved to Malvern because of the danger of commando raids, fear of German interception of TRE experimental transmissions and vulnerability to bombing on the south coast of England.
In the spring of 1940, when some of the airborne radar team moved to Worth Matravers, others from the team, including Keith Wood, Robert Hanbury-Brown, Gerald Touch and Roy Hearsum moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE)at Farnborough [ 7].
The RAE were responsible for aircraft research and in 1940 its Radio Department was tasked with overseeing the engineering and production of 1.5 m ASV and AI systems.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 1-2 TRE were closely involved not only in the design of the radars but most importantly in assessing radar performance through trials and providing advice to the RAF on the operation and maintenance of the new equipment.
The early radarswere dif ﬁcult to use and maintain and required special training of the operators and maintainers.
Tactical operating techniques also needed to be developed.
RAF Coastal Command set up a training and evaluation unit, the Coastal Command Development Unit (CCDU), at Carew Cheriton in December 1940.
This unit was tasked with undertaking trials of new radars and developing tactics for their use.This work was very valuable and CCDU was expanded to undertake service trials of all new Coastal Command aircraft and equipment [ 1].
CCDU moved to Ballykelly in November 1941 and then in June 1942 to Tain.
In September 1943 CCDU movedto RAF Angle.
Finally, in January 1945, the CCDU moved to Thorney Island and was renamed the Air Sea Warfare Development Unit (ASWDU).
1.3.1 Post WWII After WWII, ASWDU continued to be responsible for testing new equipment to be used by Coastal Command.
In 1948 ASWDU moved from Thorney Island toBallykelly.
In 1951 it moved to St Mawgan and then in 1958 back to Ballykelly.
ASWDU were active from 1945 to 1969, when the Central Tactical and Trials Organisation (CTTO) was set up in RAF Strike Command.
CTTO was responsiblefor the trialling of operational modi ﬁcations and the development of tactics for all RAF operational aircraft.
In January 1947, a Joint Anti-Submarine School (JASS) was set up in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The role of JASS was to run courses to train RN and RAF crews of ships and aircraft on the broader aspects of anti-submarine warfare.
In the 1950s, JASS had a ﬂight of Shackletons for trials use, but this was disbanded in 1957.
The research organisations also continued to evolve.
In 1953 TRE was merged with the British Army ’s Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE) to become the Radar Research Establishment (RRE).
In 1957 its name was further changed to the Royal Radar Establishment, also RRE.
In 1976, RRE was merged with the Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE) to become theRoyal Signals and Radar Establishment, RSRE.
In 1991, the major research establishments, including RSRE and RAE, were combined as the Defence Research Agency (DRA), which became the Defence Evaluation and ResearchAgency (DERA) in 1995.
In 2001, DERA was spilt into the privatised QinetiQ and the government-owned Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl.
1.4 The first airborne radar The word ‘radar ’wasﬁrst used in the USA in 1940 and would not have been used in the UK prior to that date.
However, it is used freely here to describe equipment thatwould at least subsequently be known as radar.
During 1935 the ﬁrst work on ground radar was started at Orfordness and early in 1936 the team was moved to Bawdsey Manor, at what became the BawdseyAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 1-3 Research Station.
It soon became evident that airborne radars would be needed and a team was set up to research this problem, under the leadership of E G Bowen.
This was a completely new ﬁeld of research which required a very different approach to that used for the ground-based radars.
The airborne radar team under E G Bowen comprised Dr A G Touch, Robert Hanbury-Brown, Bill Eastwood, Perce Hibberd, Sidney Jefferson and Keith Wood.
Much of this early work is recorded in memoirs written by team members [ 5–7].
It is also recorded in an of ﬁcial history of ASV radar development, published by the Air Ministry in 1954 [ 1] and a memorandum written by Dr Touch whilst in the USA in 1945 [ 8].
By 1936 the early ground-based radar system, RDF1, was operating at a wavelength of 10 –13 m, requiring very large antenna arrays.
It was realised that a wavelength of 1 m or 2 m would be needed to achieve the measurement precision required within the available space in an aircraft.
However, suitable transmitter valves were not available and so a wavelength of 6.7 m (45 Mc/s) was chosen.
Thisfrequency was used because the team had acquired a tuned radio frequency receiver designed by EMI for their proposed television service, which operated at a frequency of 45 Mc/s and had a bandwidth o f 1 Mc/s.
A suitable receiver could then be built but no small transmitter was available for airborne use.
Therefore, in the autumn of 1936 a bistatic experiment was set up using a ground-based transmitter and the receiver in a Heyford bomber.
This was successful on its ﬁrst ﬂight, detecting other aircraft at ranges of 8 –10 miles from a height of 2000 –3000 ft [5].
It may be noted that one of the reasons for using the Heyford bomber was that its engine ignition was reasonably well su ppressed.
Interference from engines and other electrical equipment was an early p roblem encountered with airborne radar experiments.
As the ground-based radar was known at that time as RDF 1, the new airborne radar was to be called RDF 2 and so this bistatic radar system wascalled RDF 1.5.
Soon new transmitter valves were also becoming available and by early summer of 1937 an experimental ai rborne transmitter operating on a wavelength of 1.25 m was developed and successfully demonstrated on theHeyford.
The receiver was now a superhet but used the same EMI television receiver as the IF ampli ﬁer.
Next, the team acquired an Avro Anson, K6260, which was well-suited to airborne rada r experiments and the team developed a fully airborne radar installation, RDF 2 , on 1.25 m, which could reliably detect ships at ranges of 3 –4 miles.
The transmitter output of RDF 2 was about 800 W with two 316 A valves in push –pull, using the self-modulating or squegging principle to produce a pulse length of about 1 μs and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of about 1 kc/s.
The receiver used RCA ‘Acorn ’valves in the RF and mixer stages and the display was a 9 ″Cossor CRT with an exponential time base.
Target returns were d i s p l a y e di nA - s c o p ef o r m a t ,s h o w i n g amplitude versus range over a 10 mile range scale [ 7].
The transmitter wavelength was then increased to 1.5 m in order to increase the power and about 1 kW output was achieved.
Separate transmit and receive antennas were used and these were initially simple dipoles.
Horizontal polar-isation was chosen as it was found that vert ical polarisation gave excessive returnsAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 1-4 from the sea and land.
By late 1937 experiments had started on the use of side- looking Yagi arrays, placed on the upper surfaces of both wings (receiving antennas) and tail planes (transmit antennas).
Other antenna ideas that weretried included: •a rotating half-wave dipole under the aircraft nose, •a horizontal Yagi on one wing with vertical Yagi on leading edge of other wing, •a horizontal Yagi on one tail plane with vertical Yagi on leading edge of other tail plane, •a Sterba broadside array between the king post and the tail (along the top of the fuselage).
Wood [ 7] describes the Anson 6260 as the ‘ﬂying washing line ’.
It was very un- aerodynamic (so much so that it had dif ﬁculty taking off) but gave valuable experience for the radar developments that were to come.
The subsequent rapid development of ASV radars following the outbreak of war is described in the chapters following.
1.5 Outline of the book Chapter 2describes the ﬁrst ASV radars, ASV Mks.
I and II, operating at a wavelength of 1.5 m.
Following the development of the high power magnetron, the ﬁrst centimetric ASV radar, based on H 2S Mk.
II, was ASV Mk.
III, which is described in chapter 3.
The need for improved performance led to the high power ASV Mk.
VI, described in chapter 4.
During WWII, all centimetric ASV radars operated with a wavelength of 9 cm (often referred to at the time as 10 cm ASV), but H2S Mk.
III and most subsequent marks operated with a wavelength of 3 cm.
A prototype 3 cm ASV radar was ASV Mk.
VII, described in chapter 5and this would form the basis for long-range ASV development after WWII.
3 cm ASV radars were also developed during the war for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and for CoastalCommand attack aircraft.
In association with ASV Mk.
I and II, a system of homing beacons and IFF interrogators had been developed on wavelengths around 1.5 m.
To allow thecentimetric ASV radars to access these, the Lucero transponder system was developed, as described in chapter 6.
Chapter 7provides an overview of the comparative performance of the various ASV systems and also considers how theperformance actually achieved can be compared with performance predictions based on modern analysis methods.
Finally, chapter 7concludes with an overview of the ASV systems in service at the end of WWII, including a brief discussion of theAmerican radar systems in service with Coastal Command and some of the ASV radars developed for the FAA.
The descriptions of the various radars and their operational performance are taken mainly from documents held by The National Archives in the UK, as referenced throughout.
These documents include handbooks issued by the Air Ministry and trials reports issued by TRE, CCDU and ASWDU.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 1-5 References [1] The Second World War 1939-1945 —Royal Air Force, Signals Volume VI —Radar in Maritime Warfare, Air Ministry, 1954 (TNA AIR 10/5555) [2] Ashworth C 1992 RAF Coastal Command 1936 —1969 (England: Patrick Stevens) [3] Hendrie A 2010 The Cinderella Service, RAF Coastal Command 1939 —1945 (UK: Pen and Sword Aviation) [4] Clements J 2001 Electronic Airborne Gold ﬁsh(UK: Paterchurch Publications) [5] Bowen E G 1987 Radar Days (London: Adam Hilger) [6] Hanbury-Brown R 1991 Bofﬁn, A Personal Story of the Early Days of Radar, Radio Astronomy and Quantum Optics (London: Adam Hilger) [7] Wood K 2004 Echoes and Re ﬂections (London: Serendipity) [8] Touch A G April 13 1945 Chronological History of Airborne R.D.F.

I and II 2.1 ASV Mk.
I By 1938 the Admiralty was showing signi ﬁcant interest in the potential for air to surface vessel (ASV) radar.
A basic design had been established using horizontally polarised side-looking Yagi arrays [ 1].
However, with the increase in international tension between September 1938 and the outbreak of war on 1st September 1939, ASV development was given lower priority than ground-based air defence and air- interception (AI) radar.
In July 1939, an order for 24 transmitters and 24 indicator/receivers had been placed with Metropolitan-Vickers and Pye Radio, respectively [ 2] (power supply designs, antennas and installation details were unde ﬁned) but by the start of the war there were no ASV radars in service.
Immediately the war began, the German U-boat ﬂeet was deployed, beginning hostile activities on 3rd September 1939.
Th ere was an urgent need for long-range aircraft with ASV to patrol the North Sea, although the tactical priority at thattime was for monitoring surface ships.
The relative priorities of ASV, AI, CH (chain home) and CHL (chain home low) development were discussed at a meeting on 30th November 1939 in the Air Ministry, attended by Air Marshal SirPhilip Joubert de la Ferté, Air Of ﬁcer Commanding-in-Chief Coastal Command, and Vice Admiral Sir James Somerville, representing the Admiralty [ 3].
It was agreed that ASV would be installed in 12 Hudsons to operate the northern patroland that work should recommence on ASV for Sunderlands with the highest priority.
Urgent production contracts were placed with Pye Radio for 200 ASV receiver/indicators and with E K Cole for 200 transmitters.
These transmitterswere of the same type previously ordered from Metropolitan Vickers, which had been diverted for AI radar use.
In October 1939 Bowen ’s airborne radar team [ 6] (MAPRE) had moved to RAF St Athan and we re tasked with installing what was to become ASV Mk.
I in a Lockheed Hudson aircraft.
A fascinating memoir of the work on the ASV installation is given by John Clements [ 4] (he was then an RAF wireless electrical mechanic with 32 Maintenance Unit (32 MU); he retired doi:10.1088/978-1-6432-7066-1ch2 2-1 ªMorgan & Claypool Publishers 2018 from the RAF in 1976 as an Air Commodore) .
In addition to developing the radar installation, development work includ ed test equipment and generators for running the equipment on the ground.
Special attention had to be paid to theelectrical screening in the aircraft, par ticularly the engine ignition, to prevent interference with the radar.
Theﬁrst Hudson installation was quite experimental.
The wavelength was still a nominal 1.5 m, as it had been for the pre-war work on RDF 2, and used a frequency of 214 Mc/s.
By this stage the transmitter power had been increasedusing new valves, power triodes known as ‘micropups ’, giving a peak transmitter power of 15 –20 kW.
The micropups had become available just at the start of the war and were known by the designation VT 90 (VT: valve, transmitting), withsubsequent development as CV 62 (CV possibly stands for common valve).
These were used in a self-oscillating push –pull con ﬁguration, with a peak power output of about 7 kW, for a pulse length of 1.5 μs and a PRF of 1200 c/s [ 4].
There were separate transmit and receive antenn as, which were simple dipoles.
There were two antennas for transmission and two for reception, mounted on either side of the aircraft, as shown in ﬁgure 2.1.
Transmission and reception alternated between left and right hand sides and returns were shown on an A-scope display indicating the direction of the target from the relative power of the returns in the left and right antennas.
The indicator/receiver was based on a Pye television receiver and is shown in ﬁgure 2.2.
The receiver was a superhet with a 45 Mc/s IF.
As the U-boat campaign intensi ﬁed, the need to undertake experiments to determine the ability of ASV to detect submarines became urgent.
In December 1939 trials with ASV Mk I (installed by 32 MU at St Athan) against a surfaced submarine were undertaken.
These trials indicated maximum detection ranges of5 ½ miles at 3000 ft and 3 ½ miles at 200 ft [ 2].
However, the minimum ranges, determined by the sea returns, varied between ½ mile in very calm conditions and up to 4 ½ miles.
In the worst case, submarine targets could only be detected at ranges Figure 2.1.

Although disappointing, these trials indicated areas where improvements should be made.
It was decided to install ASV in Hudson, Sunderland, Botha and Beaufort aircraft.
By the middle of January 1940, 32 MU had installed ASV Mk.
I in 12 Hudsons, allocated to Nos.
224, 233 and 220 squadrons of Coastal Command.
An understanding of the operational value of this new technology was also still beingdeveloped.
Squadrons were instructed to submit regular reports of the performance of ASV Mk.
I, some of which are recorded in an RAF ﬁle [5].
Squadron reports at the end of February 1940 showed the development of its use for reconnaissance andescort duties [ 2,5]: Reconnaissance : ASV is of great assistance at night and in bad visibility.
The detection of landfall is extremely helpful, but because of the presence ofstrong coastal echoes, coastal shipping reconnaissance presents great dif ﬁ- culties.
The radius of search ahead and laterally is extended to a distance dependent on the size and aspect of the surface vessel.
Convoy escort : ASV has enabled contact to be made with convoys at night and in extremely poor visibility.
On two occasions contact was established in complete darkness, at distances of 12 and 20 miles, and on one occasion whenvisibility was only 500 yards, at a distance of 12 miles.
Attack : when the cloud base is below 1500 ft an approach from any desired direction can be made to a ship which is otherwise invisible from the aircraft.Thus an element of surprise can be obtained by a diving attack through the clouds, emerging at the last stage at very close range.
Considerable experience of the use of ASV was developing and the shortcomings of the existing equipment were becoming clear.
Some components were unreliable, test gear and instruction books were not available and methods for measuring Figure 2.2.
Pye indicator/receiver for ASV Mk.
I [ 2].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-3 frequency and power were quite approximate.
Maintenance was dif ﬁcult and harmonics from the transmitter interfered with the communication receiver, which prevented the keeping of a continual listening watch when on patrol.
2.2 ASV Mk.
II Plans to develop a properly engineered version of ASV Mk.
I had started in January1940 and many lessons were learned from the shortcomings of ASV Mk.
I.
The Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) compiled a schedule of standard dimensions for ASV units, plugs, sockets and cables, which would make them easier to installand maintain.
It was decided that the new radar would have an indicator unit separate from the receiver, with selectable range scales of 10, 40 or 100 miles.
The radar would have its own power supply and generate 7 kW peak RF power.
Thefrequency of ASV Mk.
I on 214 Mc/s had been causing interference with naval rotating beacons and it was decided to use 176 Mc/s.
E K Cole and Pye Radio were contracted to design and develop equipment to the new speci ﬁcation, with an initial order for 4000 sets (an enormous number for a radar, by modern standards).
Despite the urgency, there was considerable delay in getting proper commercial authorisation and contracts to the companies and workwas delayed.
In addition there was an urgent need for air interception (AI) radar equipment which was given precedence.
There was also a strong demand for the chain home low (CHL) VHF radar equipment being made by E K Cole.Nevertheless by October 1940 140 ASV transmitters, 45 receivers and 80 indicating units had been delivered.
Before the end of March 1941 over 2000 transmitters and 1000 receivers had been delivered to the RAF.
Unfortunately, although both ﬁrms were working to the same requirements, they produced slightly different technical solutions which required different indicator units, as will be discussed below.
2.2.1 LRASV development Building on experience on the Anson before the war, E G Bowen submitted proposals for long-range ASV (LRASV) in February 1940, based on the use of high gain Sterba or Yagi arrays looking sideways to the line of ﬂight [ 6].
An experimental installation was made on a Whitley with very encouraging results, detecting submarines viewed broadside at 20 miles from 2000 ft.
However, the minimum range, mainly determined by the extent of the sea return, could be 4 or 5miles at this height.
The experimental Whitley arrived at St Athan on 17 August 1940 and RAE and 32 MU were tasked with installing LRASV on 5 Whitleys, later increased to arequirement for 50.
However, progress was slow and by the end of the year the upgrade had to be made a standard modi ﬁcation, with the aircraft manufacturers responsible for installing the antennas and cables.
At that stage, simple dipole antennas were still being used for homing and their performance was inadequate.
It was recognised that greater homing ranges were needed and forward-looking high-gain Yagi arrays were developed.
In addition,Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-4 with the advent of LRASV broadside antennas a method for rapidly switching between broadside arrays and homing arrays became essential.
Initially, this was achieved by the operator unplugging one set of antennas and plugging in the new set.This was too slow in practice and very tiring for the operator if it had to be repeatedly undertaken.
Switches were needed and type 458 transmitter switch and type 459 receiver switch were developed [ 2].
In March 1941 orders were placed for 200 complete switches.
However, progress was slow, with many design and manufacturing problems and even by September 1942 problems were still beingencountered.
These dif ﬁculties would be eased to some extent by the development of the common TR unit, which was introduced during 1943.
2.2.2 ASV Mk.
II equipment Much of the information presented here on ASV Mk.
II can be found in Air Publication 2544 A Vol.
1 [ 7].
The following sections give details of the various components of the radar and their installation.
2.2.2.1 General description The radar operated on a frequency of 176 Mc/s ± 5 Mc/s and was described as being used for surface vessel location and homing onto beacons.
It used pulsed trans- missions with a pulse length of approximately 2.5 μs and a PRF of approximately 400 c/s.
The peak power output was of the order of 7 kW.
Separate transmit and receive antennas were used in the ﬁrst systems and both broadside and homing systems were installed on most aircraft.
The display was in the form of an A scope,also known as an L-scope, with range along the vertical axis and returns from left hand antennas displayed as de ﬂections to the left and from right hand antennas as deﬂections to the right, so giving an indication when homing of bearing from their relative amplitude.
Horizontal polarisation was used.
In addition to the antennas, the major components of the radar were the transmitter, receiver and indicator unit.
These are listed in tables 2.1–2.3and are discussed in more detail below.
There were very many types, with variations in power supply and signal output format that meant they were not all inter-operable.
2.2.2.2 Antennas The homing antennas were originally simple quarter-wave diploes, later changed to three-quarter wave diploes.
These were considered obsolete by late 1943 [ 7] but some systems were still in use and referred to as SRASV (short range ASV).
The LRASV homing antennas comprised a single transmitter Yagi array mounted on the nose of the aircraft and two receiving Yagi arrays, one under each wing with their axes pointed at an angle to the centre line of the aircraft.
The broadside arrays comprised a transmitting aerial on the top of the fuselage and tworeceiving arrays, one on each side of the aircraft.
The transmitting array typically comprised four pairs of dipoles, supported on masts.
The receiving array was four pairs of dipoles mounted on each side of the aircraft.
The polar diagrams of thehoming and broadside aerials are illustrated in ﬁgure 2.3.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-5 Table 2.1.

ARI 5205, only installed on some Sunderlands, had a very high-power transmitter with a separate modulator for the broadside mode.
Transmission was through the receive arrays and the transmit array was not used.
The standardtransmitter was used for homing.
Figure 2.4shows the installation ARI 5002 for a Sunderland.
It shows the separate transmit and receive aerials for broadside and homing, with type 458transmitter switch and type 459 receiver switch.
It also shows the connections to receiver type R.3039 or R.3039A, indicator type 6 or 6A and transmitter type T.3040 or T.3040D, which are described below.

2.2.2.3 Transmitters The transmitter T.3040 and variants, together with T.3069 (operating on 214 Mc/s), were similar in design.
The power supply for the transmitter was housed in the samebox and fed from the 80 V AC supply from the aircraft generator and supplying a nominal 7.5 kV at 4 mA.
A DC supply was also required for the blower or cooling fan (see table 2.1), which blew air down the Lecher line tubes onto the valve anodes.
The transmitter weighed 54 lb and its dimensions were 18 inch by 12 inch by 20 inch.
The transmitter was designed to produce a pulse of about 2.5 μs at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of about 400 c/s.
The two VT.90 valves were connected in a push –pull arrangement and tuning was achieved by anode lecher lines with an adjustable shorting bar.
The lecher lines were coupled to two further lines forming aresonant system tuned by a variable capacitor and mechanically adjustable coupling between the anode system and the output lines.
The transmitter output was matched to an 80 ohm feeder to the aerials.
The cathode circuits were also tuned and providedwith preset adjustments.
The transmitter operated on a squegging principle controlled by an RC ﬁlter connected to the valve grids and the power rail.
The tuning of the transmitter circuitswas apparently very dif ﬁcult, with much interaction between the tuning settings, the antenna load and the power supply voltages.
The tuning also affected the pulse Figure 2.4.
Aerial installation ARI 5002 for a Sunderland [ 7].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-8 repetition frequency, although the pulse length was approximately constant for a given power supply voltage.
The transmitter unit included a meter to monitor thecurrent taken by the valves.
Typically the valves took 1.5 A each whilst oscillating.
With a pulse length of 2.5 μs and a PRF of 400 c/s the average current consumption should have been about 3 mA and the average current was then an indication ofPRF.
The usual value obtained was 4 –4.5 mA; operators were instructed to shut down the transmitter to prevent damage if readings of 8 mA or greater were observed (indicating a very high PRF).
The transmitter also provided synchronising pulses to the indicator units from sockets on the front panel.
Figure 2.5.
Homing aerials on a Hudson (ARI 5077, homing aerials only) [ 7].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-9 A high-power transmitter, T.3140, and a separate modulator, type 52, was introduced into service in the spring of 1943 (ARI 5205).
This was designated ASV Mk.
IIA and had a peak power of 100 kW [ 2].
It required the installation of a 1.2 kW alternator in the aircraft and was double the weight of the lower power transmitters.
Six sets were installed in Sunderlands.
It gave much increased detection ranges, but at the price of increased sea returns and greater vulnerability to interception by radar warning receivers (see discussion below).
With the advent of centimetric ASV, interest in ASV Mk IIA receded and production was curtailed toonly 12 sets ( ﬁgures 2.7and2.8).

T1, T2 and T3 are the power supply transformers, V1 and V2 are the recti ﬁer diodes and C11, C12 and C13 are power supply smoothing capacitors; the anode Lecher line and output ﬁlter are in the rear compartment [ 7].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-10 2.2.2.4 Receivers The two main types of receiver were the R.3039 series, which used acorn valves (VR95) in the RF stages, and R.3084 series, which used VR136 (RF pentode) and VR137 (RF triode for the local oscillator) valves.
By 1943 the R.3039 series wasconsidered obsolete.
There was a further subdivision between receivers designed by Pye Radio and E K Cole.
The receivers consisted of two stages of RF ampli ﬁcation, a local oscillator, a mixer, three stages of IF ampli ﬁcation, a detector and two stages of video ampli ﬁcation.
The IF was 31 Mc/s with a bandwidth of about 2 Mc/s.
The receivers of the Pye design used an anode bend second detector, giving a negative output signal, while the Cole designed receivers used a diode second detector, giving a positive output.
This meant that different indicating units were required.
An important part of the receiver was the motor-driven aerial switch unit, which was used to connect each aerial alternately to the receiver and simultaneously to Figure 2.8.
Transmitter valves V3 and V4 and Lecher lines L1 and L2; output ﬁlter is L3 and L4, tuned by C1.
L8, L9, L19 and L11, with associated capacitors, are cathode ﬁlters, with access for adjustment of C9 and C10 from the front panel [ 7].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-11 connect the output of the receiver and to apply it to the appropriate left or right deﬂector plates of the indicator.
Various designs of aerial switch were used, but all provided a successive dwell time of about 20 ms on each aerial, equivalent to about 8pulses.
Switch units type 35 and 35A (E K Cole designed receivers, see table 2.2) were driven by a motor rotating at 10 000 rpm through a 22:3 reduction gear.
The aerial inputs were successively connected over 180 °± 2.5 °of rotation and the outputs connected over 170 –175 °intervals.
Switch units type 25 and 42 were used for the Pye receivers.
The two switch sections were on a common shaft rotated at16–20 rps.
Type 25 operated off 24 V DC and type 42 off 12 V DC.
Switch unit type 25 is shown in ﬁgure 2.9.
The receiver gain was adjusted by controlling the voltage applied to the screen grids on the pentodes in the second RF stage and the three IF stages (VR.91).
The gain control was a variable resistor located in each of the indicator units.
A switch on the receiver could select whether the local or remote indicator unit was to be usedto control the gain.
The power supplies for both the receiver and the local and remote indicating units were housed in the receiver.
The various receiver types listed in table 2.2represent variations and improve- ments applied to the Pye and Cole receiver designs.
R.3084A was the same as R.3132, but manufactured by Cossor.
Aircraft that had the Common T & Rinstalled (see section 2.2.4) used R.3132B, which was a modi ﬁed version of R.3132 with a spark gap (VI 507) across the aerial input and a switch ﬁtted to the front panel Figure 2.9.

2.2.2.5 Indicating units Indicating units type 6A, 6B and 6C operated from Cole-designed receivers with a positive output and indicating units type 6 operated from the Pye receivers with a negative output.
The display was a 6 inch CRT (VCR 97) with a vertical trace, withzero range at the bottom of the display.
Range scales of 9, 36 or 90 miles were Figure 2.10.

An engraved Perspex scale of miles was inserted in front of the display.
Returns from the port and starboard antennas were displayed as deﬂections to the left and right of the vertical trace, respectively.
An illustration of the display trace is shown in ﬁgure 2.12.
The receiver gain was controlled from the indicating unit.
Other operator controls adjusted focus and brilliance.
Pre-set operator controls for horizontal and vertical shift were also provided on the front panel.
Calibration and other alignmentfacilities were pre-set controls within the unit.
A viewing visor to cut out external light could also be ﬁtted (see example in a Warwick aircraft in ﬁgure 2.14(b)).
In late 1943, Indicating unit type 96 was introduced as a replacement for type 6A or 6B.
This included the following improvements: four range scales of 3, 12, 30 or 120 miles; a more stable time base to reduce jitter; a range calibrator showing ¼, 1, 5 or 10 mile intervals, respectively, on the four range scales.
These were shown as ‘black-out ’marks and could be selected by a pull-out switch on the range scale knob; edge lighting of the range scale, from the left for 3 or 30 mile scales and from the right for 12 or 120 mile scale; provision for IFF suppression; input for strobe indication.
The various indicating units are shown in ﬁgure 2.13.
2.2.2.6 Pilot ’s indicator There was a continuing operational requirement during 1940 and 1941 to provide a pilot ’s indicator display.
It was believed that this would greatly aid ASV perform- ance.
However, providing a suitable display that could readily be used by the pilotproved very dif ﬁcult, both in terms of wiring and receiver design, as well as practicality.
During late 1941 and early 1942 three types of pilot ’s indicator underwent extensive service trials.
However, the requirement was eventually Figure 2.12.
Radar display showing sea return and target with bearing to starboard of the aircraft [ 2].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-14 cancelled by Headquarters Coastal Command, who decided that improvement of the standard of ASV operators should be the aim, rather than undermining their self- conﬁdence by having their statements and powers of concentration being checked by other crew members [ 2].
As will be discussed in chapter 4, a simple meter indicating target range and bearing was eventually introduced for the pilot as part of the blind bombing facility on ASV Mk.
VI.
2.2.3 Radar installations Two examples of typical installations are shown in ﬁgure 2.14.
These arrangements were often very un-ergonomic and uncomfortable for the operators.
Either viewing visors or black-out curtain were ﬁtted to aid visibility of the display.
Figure 2.15 shows an example of a remote indicating unit, mounted in the nose of a Hudson.
Figure 2.16shows the installation in the rear of a Sunderland of ARI 5205, the high- power transmitter, T.3140, and the separate modulator, type 52.

This installation required a separate motor-driven switch unit for both antenna and receiver-output switching, together with spark-gap protection for the receiver duringtransmission.
One example is ARI 5136 [ 8], installed in Barracuda aircraft, which had only homing antennas.
A radar interconnection diagram is shown in ﬁgure 2.17.
Aerial coupling box type 8 housed the aerial switch unit type 98A, together with spark gaps for receiver protection.
The receiver R.3132B included additional spark gap protection and a switch to disengage its internal aerial switch unit, which was notrequired.
An illustration of the aerial coupling box type 8 is shown in ﬁgure2.18, and ﬁgure 2.19 shows a schematic of the switching arrangement.
It relied on accurately matched half-wave and quarter-wave lines, combined with spark gap switches Figure 2.17.
ARI 5136 with common T & R [ 8].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-17 that presented a short-circuit when excited.
On transmit, the two spark gaps would ﬁre and the path from transmitter to receiver, shown in ﬁgure 2.19(a), would appear open circuit when viewed from the transmitter, with a low impedance towards the antennas.
On receive, with the spark gaps open circuit, the path between antennasand transmitter would appear high impedance with a low impedance seen by the receive path.
The antenna switch would alternately short-circuit the half-wave stubs connected to the port and starboard antennas, causing the path to those antennas toalternately appear high impedance, with transmission or reception on the other antenna.
The lower part of the aerial switch unit, shown in ﬁgure2.19(b) was used to synchronously switch the receiver output between left and right CRT plates.
Thisunit would have been designed for a speci ﬁc transmitter frequency and would have introduced additional losses if the transmitter frequency was appreciably off tune.
Aerial switch unit type 98A rotated at 600 rpm or 10 rps.
The switch segments each operated over 45 °, giving an effective switch rate of 20 rps, the same as in the internal aerial switch unit in the receiver.
The spark gaps were VI507, having tungsten electrodes with 0.7 mm gap.
The glass envelope was ﬁlled with argon at 600 mmHg, with 5 mg of mercury.

2.2.5 Performance of ASV Mk.
II One feature of many early radar trials was the great variation in performance that was observed.
This was due to variations in the equipment itself and also to component failures, poor tuning and so on.
The effects of radar propagation and sea returns, which were only just beginning to be understood, and variations in targetradar cross section also contributed.
Also very signi ﬁcant were the great variations in operator skill levels and the lack of concentration during long operations due to fatigue.
There was an appreciation of the possible effects of multipath scattering, leading to interference between the direct signal from the radar at the target and the signal reﬂected off the sea surface.
Simple theory predicts that when operating at low altitude the power received from a point target at a ﬁxed height above a smooth reﬂecting surface should be proportional h 4/R8where his the aircraft height and Ris the slant range between the radar and the target.
This suggested that the range Rat which a given power level would be received should vary in proportion to hand this effect was expected to be observed in early trials.
However, this simple theory neglected to account for the effects of a rough sea or the fact that the backscatter from a submarine target would have been from a number of scattering centres atvarious heights above the sea surface.
In June 1942 the Operational Research section, HQ Coastal Command, reported on the performance of ASV Mk.
II [ 9] in both LRASV and SRASV versions.
The main conclusions were that the results were very variable and, in particular, that the detection range against a surfaced submarine did not vary proportionally to h.
Attempts were made to ﬁnd a ﬁt to the variation in detection range with height and this was observed to be about h0.2orh0.3.
The reports also compared detection ranges on operational sorties with those on trials (when a TRE expert was usually in attendance) and practices (under controlled conditions).
The average detectionranges against a surfaced submarine results are shown in table 2.4.

Better performance than expected was achieved at low altitudes and it was concluded that operation at heights above about 2000 ft would not bring signi ﬁcant beneﬁt.
In particular, operating at higher altitudes increased the range of the sea returns, so reducing the swept area of search.
Minimum ranges varied from less than ½ mile to more than 4 miles, dependent on sea conditions and aircraft height.
Reports describing the installation of ASV Mk.
II on different aircraft were issued by the Radio Department at RAE (e.g.
[ 10,11]).
Installations were also tested by CCDU [ 12].
In [ 10], performance of a prototype installation in a Beau ﬁghter was reported.
The Beau ﬁghter was mainly used in a strike role and only had forward- looking homing antennas.
It was found that the Yagi array being used fortransmission interacted with the quarter wave dipoles being used on receive.
RAE installed a common T & R using an antenna coupling box type 9, and removed the transmit antenna, which solved the problem.
Antenna coupling box type 9 wassimilar to the type 8, but used for common T & R from the broadside arrays of ASV Mk.
II, such as on the Liberator III, ARI 5184 (see section 2.2.2.2 ).
2.2.6 Leigh Light During 1941 and early 1942 it was found that despite the improved performance of LRASV there were great dif ﬁculties in pressing home an attack at night.
This was because sea returns tended to limit the minimum ASV range to about 1 mile and at night targets were then lost as the aircraft approached closer, as there was no way ofilluminating the target.
U-boats were exploiting this weakness by mainly surfacing at night.
It was not until the advent of the Leigh Light that successful illumination would be achieved.
The Leigh Light was a 22 million Candela carbon arc searchlightwith 24 inch diameter that could be steered in azimuth and elevation when homing onto a target.
This was ﬁrst deployed in June 1942 in LRASV Wellingtons of No.
172 squadron.
Although there were only 5 Leigh Light Wellingtons availableduring June and July 1942, they had an immediate and disproportionate effect on U- boat tactics, forcing them to remain submerged day and night, only surfacing to recharge their batteries [ 2].
The Leigh Light was widely adopted, by the end of the war being deployed in squadrons of Wellington, Liberator, Catalina and Warwick V aircraft.
Further discussion on the integration of the Leigh Light with ASV Mk.
VI can be found in chapter 4.
2.2.7 Disappearing contacts After initial success in the use of ASV Mk.
II for detecting U-boats during 1941 and early 1942, it was increasingly noticed during late 1942 that U-boat radar contactswere disappearing before they could be sighted and engaged.
It was concluded that the enemy may have introduced ‘listening gear ’, that was alerting them to the presence of an aircraft with ASV.
The use of a sensitive radar warning receiver cangive considerable range advantage compared with the reciprocal detection range of the radar, since the received power from the radar only varies as 1/ R 2compared with the 1/ R4variation of power returned to the radar.
Often a warning receiver on aAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-20 target might be expected to detect a radar signal at a greater range than the radar could detect the target.
It had been suspected for some time that the Germans might introduce ASV listening devices on the U-boats.
The possibility was investigated in October 1941 [13] but at that time it was concluded that there was no disadvantage to the use of ASV.
However, by late 1942 it was apparent that there was a signi ﬁcant problem.
A report published in April 1943 [ 14] analysed the results of 350 disappearing contacts taken from observations recorded in operators ’log books.
It was believed that most of these disappearing contacts were U-boats, with the ranges at which they were ﬁrst detected being comparable to the ranges of known U-boat detections.
A plot of ﬁrst detection ranges, together with ranges at which contacts were lost and the range extent over which they had been tracked is shown in ﬁgure 2.20.
Extrapolation of the statistics of the tracking ranges suggested that possibly 50% of U-boats dived before detection and were never seen.
After ASV Mk.
II enteredservice it had previously been estimated that daytime sighting of U-boats had increased by 20%.
If as a result of using a listening device 50% of U-boats were diving before they were contacted, it was concluded that daylight operation of ASVwas in fact a de ﬁnite disadvantage and it was recommended that daylight use be suspended.
It was further concluded from analysis of the operational logbooks that listening devices had ﬁrst been introduced for U-boats operating in the Bay of Biscay in June 1942 and their use in that area was more or less universal by September 1942.
For the Gibraltar area it was concluded that they had been introduced in November1942, with fairly universal use by January 1943.
In fact it was later determined that prototypes of the U-boat warning receiver, FuMB 1 Metox R 600 A, were ﬁrst introduced in August 1942 and that by the end of the year almost all U-boats had itinstalled [ 2].
Figure 2.20.
Pick-up, disappearing and homing ranges on forward aerials (numbers refer to number of disappearing contacts) (redrawn from [ 14]).Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-21 Further evidence of the introduction of Metox was found from analysis of the total number of U-boat sightings by aircraft with and without ASV, over the periods May to September 1942 and October 1942 to February 1943.
This is shown in table2.5.
It can be seen that in the later period, when Metox had been widely introduced, there were more frequent sightings of U-boats by non-ASV ﬁtted aircraft.
These sightings would have mainly occurred during daylight, reinforcing the conclusion that the use of ASV during daylight had become counter-productive.
The introduction of Metox was a serious setback for ASV operation and shipping losses started to increase again.
A possible mitigation strategy proposed for submarines detected in the forward beam was to immediately reduce height to about 100 ft and approach the submarine in the lower part of the multipathinterference lobe.
The strength of the signal received by a warning receiver from a radar at a height hshould vary as hat a given range, in the same manner as the suggested variation with height for radar returns.
It was reckoned that an ASV at that altitude might approach as close as 1 nmi before it was detected.
However,ﬂying at 100 ft required a reliable and accurate radio altimeter, which was not available at that time.
Attempts were being made in the UK to design a suitable radio altimeter but eventually type AYD altimeters from the USA were adopted forASV use, towards the end of 1943 when centimetric radar was entering service [ 2].
The use of ASV ‘ﬂooding ’was also tried to overcome the effectiveness of radar warning receivers.
This involved using a large number of aircraft at night over theBay of Biscay with ASV switched on, so that the U-boats could not afford to dive on every contact.
Meanwhile, Leigh Light aircraft would use ASV only intermittently, in an attempt to catch a U-boat off guard.
The 100 kW ASV Mk.
IIA systems onSunderlands were used for this purpose.
However, the number of aircraft required for this was excessive and the use of ﬂooding was abandoned.
The strategy was also used in modi ﬁed form in much more con ﬁned areas, but was superseded by the advent of centimetric ASV.
2.2.8 The Vixen attenuator One possible countermeasure to the Metox warning receiver was to reduce the transmitted power as the radar approached the U-boat, so that it would appear not to be getting closer.
Equipment for achieving this was designed in a squadron and tested by CCDU in June 1943 [ 15].
The attenuator was a quarter-wave stub attached to the transmitter antenna feed, with sliding short circuit that could be moved along the stub, to provide perfect matching (zero attenuation) between the transmitter and Table 2.5.

The apparatus is shown inﬁgure 2.21.
The tuning stub was made from two lengths of 12 SWG copper wire, bent into ¾ of a circle with a radius of 4 ¾ inch.
The two wires were spaced apart by¾ inch and held ﬁrmly in place by insulating blocks.
The sliding short circuit was controlled by a rotatable arm.
An end-stop was adjusted for minimum attenuation, when the stub would have been a quarter wavelength long.
The installation in a Wellington Mk.
VIII is shown in ﬁgure 2.22.
Tests were made against a radar receiver on the ground and an approximately constant signal strength could be maintained at the receiver as the radar approached.
Figure 2.21.

II, with control set for minimum attenuation [ 15].
Figure 2.22.
Vixen on ASV Mk.
II in a Wellington Mk.
VIII [ 15].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 2-23 A problem with this approach to attenuation was that it changed the loading on the transmitter.
It was observed that as attenuation increased, the PRF decreased and the frequency increased by about 0.5 to 1 Mc/s.
However, it was noted that the toneheard by a receiver would increase when the radar was diving towards it and this might serve to offset the decrease in PRF due to the attenuator, preventing a receiver operator being alerted to any changes.
It was found that power could be reduced to about 1/3 of its maximum value (from 35 W mean power to about 13 W mean power, as measured on test set 28),while the PRF changed from 315 c/s at maximum power to 255 c/s at minimum power.
The report recommended that Vixen be installed in all ASV Mk.
II aircraft.
However, this did not start until November 1943 and was not completed until February 1944, by which time most aircraft had been ﬁtted with centimetric ASV [ 2].
2.3 The value of ASV Mk.
II A summary of ASV Mk II given in [ 2] states that after three years of intensive research, development and war experience of airborne radar, there had been developed in ASV Mk.
II an invaluable radar search device.
As discussed in section 2.2.7, until the advent of the German radar warning receiver, the use of ASV had increased the number of daylight attacks against U-boats by 20%.
Attacks using radar had a tendency to be more successful than those made by visual sightings, due to the element of surprise.
Analysis of night attacks between August 1941 andSeptember 1942 showed that out of a total of 31 attacks only two had been made without the use of ASV and these occurred during bright moonlight.
Night attack against U-boats was practically impossible without ASV.
The lessons learned in thedevelopment of ASV Mk.
II were to be invaluable in the subsequent development of centimetric ASV radar.

III 3.1 Operational requirement for ASV in October 1942 The operational requirements for ASV were continually evolving to meet the changing threat.
By October 1942 the ASV Radar Committee had de ﬁned the requirements reproduced from [ 1] in the box below.
This re ﬂected the lessons learned from the use of ASV Mk.
II and at this time extensive work was underway to improve the performance of ASV systems, as discussed below.
The Metox warning receivers were only just starting to be installed in U-boats and their impacton the performance of metric ASV was not yet fully appreciated.
This would lead to an urgent requirement to develop cent imetric ASV systems, as described in this chapter.
OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A.S.V.
RADAR COMMITTEE 2 OCTOBER 1942 [ 1] The Aim of ASV The primary function of ASV is to provide a means for aircraft to locate, and home on to, enemy shipping beyond visual range, thereby increasing the search area ofindividual aircraft.
It should further provide information to assist in the location ofenemy aircraft when early warning information is available.
Secondly, ASV is required to enable aircraft to locate and home on to friendly shipping convoys, to whom they are providing escort protection.
Thirdly, ASV is required to provide a means whereby an aircraft can ﬁx its position, home on to a base on land or water, and thereafter, if necessary, make a beam approach with minimum external human aid.
Such provisions as may be necessary tointerrogate beacons from the ASV directly, or alternately from ancillary apparatus, and appropriately to receive and display the response, depend on policy decisions as to the nature of the beacon system generally adopted.
Requirements to Meet the Aim doi:10.1088/978-1-6432-7066-1ch3 3-1 ªMorgan & Claypool Publishers 2018 ASV equipment should provide long-range detection over a wide ﬁeld in all directions from the aircraft.
It should provide for display of information to determine if the detected craft is friendly or doubtful.
The indication should enable the detectedtarget to be closed, and include display of information on type of target.
The accuracy given in range and direction should be such as to enable low altitude blind bombing or torpedo attack to be carried out.
These characteristics should be retained throughoutthe full range of operational heights of the aircraft in which ASV equipment is ﬁtted.
ASV should provide aircraft of a striking force despatched to attack enemy shipping with means of homing onto a beacon carried in a reconnaissance aircraft shadowingthe enemy force.
The third requirement will be met by ASV equipment which enables the aircraft to position itself by, and home on to, secure coded beacons from long ranges, together with the ability to receive directional indications from special beacons with suf ﬁcient accuracy to enable a beam approach to be executed.
ASV equipment should give full display of information to the operator and incorporate the maximum of automatic control.
A simple form of indicator should,in addition, be provided for the pilot, which he may, or may not, use at his own convenience.
Detailed RecommendationsAll future ASV equipment should aim at ful ﬁlling the following requirements: (a) (i) It is essential to afford location in plan in all forward directions and it is desirable to afford such location in all directions.
(ii) PPI or other appropriate map type presentation should be used, and a pilot ’s indicator of appropriate characteristic incorporated in the installation.
(b) Maximum ranges from aircraft at 1,000 ft should be not less than: (i) Against submarine, conning tower only 10 miles (ii) Against submarine awash 20 miles(iii) Against a single ship of 1,000 tons 20 miles(iv) Against battleships 40 miles(v) Against E-boats (aircraft at 500 ft) 10 miles(vi) Against aircraft 8 miles (c) Beacons should be readable up to ranges of at least 100 miles.
(d) Azimuth should be indicated in all directions represented to not more than plus or minus 3 degrees error and within 10 degrees of the dead ahead position to within plus or minus 1 degree error and desirably within plus or minus 1 degreedeteriorating to a maximum of 3 degrees at 25 degrees from dead ahead position with no sensible time lag in the electrical equipment in order to be used with low altitude blind bombing or blind torpedo attack.
(e) It must give immediate identi ﬁcation to the crew as to whether the target is friend or doubtful.
Some method of identi ﬁcation of friendly targets is of paramount importance.
(f) The pilot and observer of aircraft ﬁtted with ASV should have visual indications given to them of the ASV beam approach system.
(g) Equipment should incorporate anti-jamming devices to enable it to function in spite of enemy attempts to interfere with the performance of the equipment.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-2 (h) It should provide, when required, an aural indication of the presence of a target.
(i) Beacon coding and IFF from friendly ships or aircraft should be readable by both the pilot and the observer.
(j) The equipment is to be suitable for use at heights between 50 and 15,000 ft.
3.2 Centimetric airborne radar development and trials Early work on centimetric radar for airborne use was started at Worth Matravers, near Swanage in Dorset, at the Ministry of Aircraft Production Research Establishment (MAPRE).
The name of this organisation was changed to theTelecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in November 1940.
In May 1942, TRE moved to Malvern, because of the danger of commando raids and vulnerability to bombing on the south coast of England.
The ﬁrst centimetric radar developments were aimed at air interception (AI) radar for ﬁghter aircraft.
Work on a blind navigation device for Bomber Command started in October 1941 and on 29 December 1941 Bernard Lovell (later Sir Bernard Lovell) was instructed to stop hiswork on AI and take charge of the development team at TRE [ 2].
In December 1941 contracts were placed with EMI for the manufacture of 50 complete H 2Su n i t s .T h e EMI team was led by A D Blumlein [ 3], a pioneer in the development of television and widely regarded at that time as one of the best electronic engineers in the country [ 2].
Early work at EMI concentrated on the development of a klystron transmitter but this was overtaken by the magnetron design developed by TRE.
Tragically, Blumlein andtwo key EMI associates (C O Brown and F Blythen), together with ﬁve RAF crew, were killed testing the prototype magnetron H 2S in a Halifax bomber in the Wye Valley on 7 June 1942 [ 2,3].
However, work on the manufacture of H 2Sa tE M I continued, led by E L C White, for the remainder of the war.
During 1942, various approaches to improving the performance of ASV were investigated.
Consideration was given to high-power metric ASV (100 kW), a 50 cm ASV and a 10 cm ASV.
It was eventually decided that the best approach was likely to be a 10 cm system, and work was initiated with Ferranti to develop a suitableradar [ 1], to be called ASV Mk.
III.
However, progress was very slow and it was clear that the Ferranti equipment would not be available before the spring of 1943 at the earliest.
The widespread introduction of the Metox warning receiver on theU-boats by the end of 1942, discussed in chapter 2, meant that there was an urgent need to improve ASV performance, including a change of wavelength.
It was decided to utilise the H 2S, by then in production by EMI Electronics (The Gramophone Company) for Bomber Command.
The Ferranti ASV contract was cancelled and H 2S was adapted for use as ASV Mk.
III.
The real urgency for effective centimetric ASV caused its acquisition to be regarded as equally importantas H 2S was for Bomber Command.
Two prototype installations on Wellington VIII aircraft were completed at No.
30 MU in December 1942 and the CCDU work on assessing ASV Mk.
III started in January 1943.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-3 3.3 ASV Mk.

ASV Mk.
III was in service with RAF 172 Squadron, Chivenor, at the start of March 1943, ﬁtted in Wellington XII aircraft with Leigh Light ( ﬁgure 3.1).
The radars were soon upgraded to ASV Mk.
IIIA, designated ARI 5153, which is described here.
A good technical description can be found in [ 4], produced by the Air Ministry in November 1943.

The Lucero equipment is described further in chapter 6.
A simpli ﬁed block diagram of the radar is shown in ﬁgure 3.2.
The transmitter receiver (T2R) comprised the magnetron transmitter, receive mixer and a ﬁrst stage of IF ampli ﬁcation.
The local oscillator, a klystron, was housed in the indicator unit, together with the PPI and height tube displays.
The master clock was the waveform generator.
The high voltage pulses to drive the magnetron were generated in the modulator.
The IF ampli ﬁer, detector and mixers for combining radar signals with the range and height markers were contained in the receiver.
A physical connection diagram [ 4] is shown in ﬁgure 3.3, which also shows the various switch units and the power supply.
Each of these units is described in more detail below.
The key radar parameters for ASV Mk.
IIIA are given in table 3.1.
3.3.1 Waveform generator type 26 The waveform generator acted as the master clock for the radar, providing the timing waveforms for the scanner, the PPI and height tube displays, and the modulator.
Thebasic timing reference was a free-running multivibrator with a repetition interval of 1500μs ± 10%, giving a nominal pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 660 c/s.
3.3.2 Transmitter –receiver (T 2R unit) TR.
3191 or TR.
3159 The TR comprised a magnetron transmitting valve, CV64, the pulse transformer, the aerial feeder, a soft rhumbatron TR switch, the crystal mixer and one stage of IF ampli ﬁcation and ﬁltering.
The front panel of TR.3191 is shown in ﬁgure 3.4.
The modulator, type 64, provided a 3.3 kV pulse which was applied to a pulse transformer in the TR, providing 10 –15 kV to the magnetron.
The output of the magnetron was fed by coaxial cable to the waveguide feed of the scanner.

This had a frequency range of 2500 –6900 Mc/s, with a nominal forward resistance of 265 Ω(ideally <200Ωbut up to 400 Ωwas considered satisfactory) and a forward –back ratio of about 8:1.
These devices were extremely prone to damage from high RF ﬁelds, as discussed in chapter 4, section 4.7.1.
The crystal mixer was fed from a ‘T’junction in the coaxial feed from the magnetron to the antenna and protected during transmission by a TR switch.
This switch comprised a soft rhumbatron, which was placed a quarter wavelength from the T junction, shown in ﬁgure 3.5.
The soft rhumbatron, also known as a soft Sutton tube, was a resonant cavity, similar to that used in a klystron, that was ﬁlled with water vapour at about 6 mm pressure.
The cavity was heated to maintain the correct vapour pressure.
A probe in the tube was held at −1000 V so Figure 3.4.
TR.3191 [ 5].
Figure 3.5.
(a) The soft rhumbatron TR cell [ 4]; (b) TR switch circuit.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-7 that the gas was close to ionisation.
A coupling loop into the rhumbatron terminated the quarter-wave line from the T junction.
The arrival of a high energy magnetron pulse caused the gas to ionise, presenting a short-circuit to the end of the quarter-wave line, which was re ﬂected as an open-circuit at the T junction.
On reception, the rhumbatron acted as a resonant cavity (tuned to the magnetron frequency as part of the radar set-up procedure) and a second coupling loop connected the received signals to the mixer cavity, where the LO signal from the indicator unit was injected.
The IF signal at 13.5 Mc/s was taken from the mixer to the IF ampli ﬁer.
3.3.3 Receiver unit The receiver unit, type 3516 or 3515, took the IF signal at 13.5 Mc/s from the T 2R unit and provided the main IF ampli ﬁcation and ﬁltering (using a chain of six VR65 pentodes and coupled IF transformers).
The IF bandwidth at −3 dB was 3.5 Mc/s.
Valves 1 and 3 in the IF chain were suppressed during transmission to prevent residual breakthrough from the TR switch from saturating the ampli ﬁer.
This was achieved by the 20 μs priming pulse from the modulator being applied after suitable ampli ﬁcation to their screen grids.
The IF signals were detected with a valve diode (VR92).
The video was ampli ﬁed and then mixed with the course marker and range marker.
The video signals werethen passed to the waveform generator for mixing with the bright-up waveform, to generate the PPI spokes, before passing to the indicator unit.
3.3.4 Indicator unit type 162 The indicator unit type 162 provided the radar displays and local oscillator controls.
Figure 3.6shows the front panel with the PPI and height tube displays, the operator controls and the various connector sockets.
The controls on indicator unit type 162 were: PPI brightness; PPI vertical shift (preset); PPI horizontal shift (preset); PPI focus control; Height tube brightness control; Height tube vertical shift (preset); Height tube focus (preset); Main tuning control; Mixer current control; Mixer coupling adjustment; Local oscillator coarse frequency control (inside unit).
The local oscillator (LO) was installed in this unit because it was believed that it might require adjustment by the operator beyond simple tuning.
The LO controlscomprise the mixer current control, the adjustment of the LO coupling and LO tuning.
The mixer current was displayed on the ammeter dial and was set at about 0.5 mA, using the mixer current control.
Additional control of the LO amplitudeAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-8 and hence the mixer current could be achieved by directly adjusting the coupling to the klystron by physically rotating the link from the front panel coaxial socket.
During normal operation the magnetron would drift in frequency and regular re-tuning of the LO frequency was necessary.
This was achieved with the tuning control which physically adjusted plungers in the klystron cavity.
The LO would be tuned for maximum response of a strong target on the height tube with the antennastationary or a large target such as land on the PPI when scanning.
The displays on the indicator unit comprised a 5 inch diameter PPI and the 2 inch diameter height tube.
The main controls available to the operator were for their respective brightness.
There were pre-set controls for focus, contrast and shift.

Note the coaxial cable from the local oscillator almost obscuring the height tube display.
The Switch Unit is also shown and is discussed in section 3.3.5.
Above the indicator unit can be seen part of a Fishpond display, that was ﬁtted to H 2S Mk.
IIB and later H 2S variants, but not on ASV Mk.
III.
Fishpond [ 2] was used to indicate the presence of targets (enemy ﬁghters or other bombers) at ranges between the aircraft and the ground.
This picture was taken in 1944 at TRE and was an experimental installation in one of three Fortresses based at RAF Defford at that time for radar countermeasures and bombing research being undertaken by TRE.
Figure 3.6.
Indicator unit type 162 [ 4].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-9 3.3.4.1 PPI display The PPI display showed slant range from zero out to 10, 30 or 50 miles, with a further display option for 50 –100 miles.
The cathode ray tube (CRT) used a long persistence phosphor with a persistence (afterglow) of 1 –2 s.
This allowed successive returns in a beam dwell to be integrated and to maintain a paint from one scan to the next.
It also meant that when changing range scales a few seconds would be neededfor the old display to fade and a new display to be established.
As well as the radar returns, the PPI display could also show a line of ﬂight marker and an operator controlled range ring.
For ASV operations, the PPI display was always orientated‘heading up ’.O nH 2S Mk.
II, there was an option to display ‘North-up ’, which was easier to interpret for navigation.
The lack of a ‘North-up ’option on the ASV Mk.
III may partly have been due to a shortage of DR compasses for the CoastalCommand Wellington aircraft [ 7].
The use of ‘North-up ’displays for ASV did not become standard until ASV Mk.
13, in the 1950s.
3.3.4.2 Height tube The height tube had a ﬁxed time base and was permanently illuminated.
The display was a vertical trace, with echoes shown as sideways de ﬂections, or blips, to the right (similar to the displays in ASV Mk.
I and Mk.
II).
At the lower end of the trace there was a region with no returns and the ﬁrst return corresponded to the ground immediately below the aircraft (received through the antenna sidelobes), hence thedisplay is called the height tube.
When the antenna was scanning, large targets at long range would only be seen as a ﬂeeting response on the height tube.
The height marker was shown as another blip (to the left).
The height control on the switch unit was adjusted until this blip disappeared into the height return and the aircraft height was read from the dial of the control on the switch unit.
A range ring was also available.
This appeared as a bright ring on the PPI or another blip (to the right) on the height tube.
The scale on the range marker control Figure 3.7.

On H 2S Mk.
II and ASV Mk.
III, a slant to plan range converter was provided in the form of curves on a drum on the switch unit.
Once the height had been set, the range pointer on the drum indicated the plan range.
Thisfeature was removed on ASV Mk.
IIIB and later versions.
Range on ASV Mk.
III was calibrated in statute miles but on ASV Mk.
IIIB and later, the range was calibrated in nautical miles (nmi).
Another important role for the height tube was to display the Lucero 1.5 m beacon homing signals.
The height tube was also used in ASV Mk.
VI for the lock-follow mode, as discussed later.
Further aspects of the control and interpretation of the displays are discussed further with the switch unit, below.
3.3.5 Switch unit type 207 The switch unit type 207 is shown in ﬁgure 3.8and also in ﬁgure 3.7.
The main operator controls included: Power-up push buttons (LT OFF, LT ON and HT ON) with associated indicator lamps; Lucero switch; Figure 3.8.
Switch unit type 207 [ 4].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-11 Scanner switch; Line of ﬂight marker switch; 10 mile zero control; Range marker control; Height marker control; Range scale and range marker scale selection; Receiver gain.
The range and marker selection switch was used to control the ranges displayed on the PPI and the scales used to mark range.
The range scale settings represented the coverage of the radius of the PPI display.
When tracking a target from longrange on the 50 mile range scale, the marker scale used was for 0 –100 miles, with the switch setting for the 100/50 range scale.
When a target of interest had a range of less than 30 miles, the selection of the 30 mile range scale was done in two stages [ 8].
First the 100/30 scale was selected, showing targets with a 30 mile radius PPI display but still using the 0 –100 miles marker scale.
In this way as the display scale was changed both target and range marker remained associated on the screen, allowing the targetto be identi ﬁed.
Now the marker scale could be changed to the more accurate 30 miles scale, by selecting the 30/30 position.
The range marker would now change position but could be moved by the operator back to the previously identi ﬁed target position.
Similarly, the scale could be moved in two steps through 30/10 to the 10/10 range scale.
Usually, routine search was undertaken on the 30/30 mile scale, with the 10/10 scale being used for homing onto targets.
The timing of the PPI radial trace started following the transmitted pulse at zero range.
The PPI and range marker then displayed slant range rather than ground range.
When operating at high altitude, aswas typical for H 2S when bombing, the error between slant range and ground range could be signi ﬁcant.
The operator could set the aircraft height on the height tube, using a variable height marker to align with the displayed ground return at theshortest range.
Then, when the range maker was set over a target of interest, the ground range could be read from a set of curves on the range drum [ 8].
This was less important for ASV operations, which usually occurred at between 1000 ft and 2000 ft,when the slant to plan error was small and was ignored.
The height marker control was later replaced by a Leigh Light marker, as discussed for ASV Mk.
VI.
Another consideration when displaying slant range is that the display will have a ‘hole’around the centre of the display, with the ﬁrst returns only appearing at a range equivalent to the radar height.
The PPI origin could be offset to control the size of this hole on the 30 and 10 mile range scales.
For the 30 mile scale, the zerosetting was pre-set for a typical operating height, but on the 10 mile scale, an operator control was provided.
This control also allowed the hole to be widened when homing onto a target.
This meant that even targets at short range could bedisplayed near the edge of the PPI, allowing better estimates of their bearings.
Once a homing run was completed, the 10 mile zero would be reset to the centre.
The line of ﬂight marker painted a radial line on the PPI, triggered at the point when the antenna scanner was aligned with the aircraft forward axis.
This could beAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-12 selected ON or OFF.
The Perspex graticule on the PPI could be rotated to align with theﬂight marker, or offset to indicate a track drift angle.
The alignment of the display and the scanner position was achieved using the heading control unit, whichallowed the operator to set the magslip stators which controlled the orientation of the picture of the PPI.
The Lucero switch controlled the display on the height tube.
Position B +H showed the beacon on PPI and height tube, while position B only displayed on the PPI.
Position BA was used for the beam approach mode of Lucero, which alsodisplayed on the height tube when approaching a landing beacon with offset beams.
3.3.6 Scanner type 51 The scanner unit type 51 was derived from scanner unit type 3 used on H 2S Mk.
II.
A signiﬁcant change was to reduce the aperture of the re ﬂector (mirror) from 36 inch to 28 inch, in order to be able to mount the scanner in the nose of the Wellington aircraft[2].
This would have given an azimuth beamwidth of about 10 °.
The original H 2S Mk.
II scanners used coaxial cable and a dipole feed but this was changed on ASV Mk.
III to a waveguide and horn feed, to give better elevation coverage at 2000 ft [ 2].
The later H 2S Mk.
IIA was also ﬁtted with a horn feed.
The connection from the transmitter to the antenna was a coaxial line.
The connection from the coaxial line to the rotating waveguide feed on the antenna was achieved through a coaxial rotatingjoint, known as a capacity sleeve, coupled into the waveguide on the scanner.
Scanner type 51, together with TR.3191, power unit type 280 and waveform generator type 26 are shown in ﬁgure 3.9.
The elevation beamwidth was about 15 °and the measured elevation pattern is shown in ﬁgure 3.10[9].
It can be seen that it had a large elevation sidelobe around 30°from the mainlobe and a null around 15 °.
The possible effect of this is discussed later.
Also shown in ﬁgure 3.10is the improved pattern developed for ASV Mk.
VI, discussed in chapter 4.
It can be seen that the ASV Mk.
III antenna pattern would have produced an unwanted variation in sensitivity of about 20 dB, taking intoaccount the two-way passage of signals through the antenna, for depression angles in Figure 3.9.
ASV Mk.
III units; A: scanner type 51; B: TR.3191; C: power unit type 280; D: waveform generator type 26 [Crown copyright, released under OGL v3.0; A5269, MRATHS].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-13 the range 15 –35°, equivalent to ranges from about 0.64 nmi to 0.29 nmi when ﬂying at 1000 ft.
This wide variation in sensitivity would have made it more dif ﬁcult for the operator to control the gain when tracking a target through sea returns at short ranges.
The scanner rotated at a ﬁxed speed of 60 rpm.
It was not stabilised against pitch or roll of the aircraft, nor could the tilt be adjusted.
Roll stabilisation was ﬁtted to H2S Mk.
IIC [ 2] but it was not used for ASV radars.
The antenna would have had a small installed tilt of about a degree or so for ASV operation but this would not have been very critical for low-level ASV operations.
3.3.7 Power unit, type 280 The power unit was used to convert 80 V AC from the aircraft ’s engine-driven generator, regulated by control panel type 5 or 6 (see ﬁgure 3.3), to the various DC voltages required.
These voltages were +300 V, +1800 V, −1800 V, −1000 V and −100 V.
The power unit was also supplied with the aircraft +24 V DC supply for activating the control relays.
The power unit and switching sequences for turning on and turning off the radar were controlled from the switch unit.
3.3.8 Setting up and operating the radar The sequence for switching on the radar was controlled by the operator using the switch unit.
After switching on the main master switch, the operator would ﬁrst press the LT ON button, when the green lamp would light.
After approximately 30 s, the operator would press the HT ON button, when the amber lamp would light.
In a further 45 s, the red lamp would light and the transmitter would automaticallyswitch on.
In order to set up the radar, the scanner motor switch would initially be set to the OFF position.
The recommended sequence was then [ 4]: i.
Set the range to position 1 (10/10) and adjust the height tube brilliance.
ii.
Set the noise level (grass) to about one-third of full output using the gain knob.
Figure 3.10.
Antenna elevation beam pattern (1-way Gain) for ASV Mk.
III and VI (adapted from [ 9]).Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-14 iii.
Adjust the crystal current control to give a meter reading of 0.25 –0.3 mA and turn the tuning knob on the indicator unit until the signals are at maximum.
This should be tuned two or three times in the ﬁrst 15 min and subsequently every 30 min during ﬂight.
iv.
Set the range switch to position 3 (30/30).
v.
Set the BRIGHTNESS, GAIN and CONTRAST controls: a.
Switch on scanner motor and set gain and contrast fully anti- clockwise.
b.
Turn brightness control until a full diameter trace is just visible, then turn it about 3 clicks anti-clockwise.
c.
Turn up the gain to the required level (max.
for long-range use).
d.
Turn the contrast control clockwise until the grass is just visible as a speckling on the tube (with the scanner revolving).
e.
As a target is approached reduce gain; contrast may be turned up slightly if desired.
vi.
Adjust the orientation of the PPI so that the upward direction on the tube face is the heading of the aircraft.
This is effected by setting the track line onthe Perspex screen to zero, setting the switch on the heading control unit to manual, and turning the setting knob until the course marker lies under the track line.
For ASV operation, the mixer current, mixer coupling, PPI focus, PPI brightness, height tube brightness and course marker were pre-set on the ground but could beadjusted by the operator if necessary.
The gain control on the switch unit would be varied continually during search between the level that gave bright noise scintilla- tions on the PPI and the level at which sea returns extended to only 1 –2 miles.
The gain would be kept as low as possible once a contact was obtained.
The 10 mile zero control on the switch unit would be used to keep a contact as near the edge of the PPI as possible on the 10 mile range.
The tuning control on the indicator unit would be checked every ½ hour or so and set to give greatest sea return.
In general, the 30/30 mile range setting would be used for searching, except for convoys and coastline detection, for which the 50/50 mile range was better.
The 10/10 range was used for homing.
3.4 ASV Mk.
IIIC The short Sunderland ﬂying boat was a very successful aircraft for long-range anti- submarine operations.
Originally ﬁtted with ASV Mk.
II radars, by August 1943 an early installation ASV Mk.
IIIC was being tested by CCDU [ 10].
It was not possible to install the scanner on the aircraft hull and so two scanners were used, one on each wing at equal distances from the hull.
The two scanners were synchronised to a maindrive.
RF energy was switched between scanners so that they each transmitted and received over a 180 °sector to the sides of the aircraft.
In order to maintain good bearing estimates in the dead-ahead position for homing onto a target, the actualAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-15 switch-over took place at 15 °to port of the dead-ahead position, so that the starboard scanner covered 195 °.
The main conclusions of the early CCDU trials were that detection performance compared well with that in a Wellington, previously reported in [ 13], with an important advantage of having a full 360 °azimuth coverage.
It was also reported that the antenna tilt appeared to be about 2 °down.
As discussed later, setting the correct tilt when installing the antennas seems to have been a recurring problem.
Further trials of a production installation were undertaken by CCDU in April 1944 [ 11].
CCDU were able to compare detection performance with recent trials they had undertaken of ASV Mk.
III in Wellington and Halifax aircraft [ 15].
It was reported that ASV Mk.
IIIC in the Sunderland achieved 20 –30% better detection range than ASV Mk.
III in the Wellington against a submarine beam-on and 50 – 100% better performance against a submarine end-on.
This improved performance was reported in [ 11] without further comment.
Possible reasons include a poor set-up of the radars in [ 15] and reduced losses with the waveguide feeds used in ASV Mk.
IIIC (see discussion on ASV Mk.
VIC in chapter 4).
It was also noted in [ 11] that the scanner tilt was about +2°above the best position.
It was found in later trials that the trim of the aircraft had to be adjusted according to the load it was carrying in order to point the antenna as required with approximately zero tilt.
3.5 Improvements to ASV Mk.
III A number of improvements and upgrades were made to H 2S Mk.
II, including a roll stabilised scanner and a scan-corrected PPI (showing ground range) on H 2S Mk.
IIC, but these were not incorporated in ASV Mk.
III.
However, by the end of 1943, production of ASV Mk.
IIIA had been replaced by ASV Mk.
IIIB, described below.
3.5.1 ASV Mk.
IIIB The modi ﬁcations introduced for ASV Mk.
IIIB were described in in a TRE Memorandum in August 1943 [ 12].
Previously ASV Mk.
III and H 2S Mk.
II units had been interchangeable but with ASV Mk.
IIIB this was now no longer the case.
The main changes were as follows.
A modi ﬁed graticule on the PPI display, together with an improved 10 mile zero control, to allow the 10 mile zero to be continuously expanded to keep a target near the edge of the PPI during homing, in order to improve the accuracy of bearing measurements.
It was estimated from trials [ 12] that when homing on a submarine the original equipment provided an average bearing accuracy of ±6 °at a range of 1000 ft, while the improved facilities provided an accuracy of ±1.7 °at a range of 1000/1500 ft.
The height marker was converted to a Leigh Light range marker, pre-set at a range of 5280 ft (1 mile) and shown as a ring on the PPI.
The slant-plan range correction curves were removed from the range drum, as they were not required for ASV operations, and the centre of the scale was calibrated in nautical miles (nmi).Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-16 Discrete steps were introduced at intervals of 1 mile on the rotating range drum to allow the operator to ‘feel’changes in range of 1 mile without diverting his gaze from the BABS (beam approach beacon system) presenta-tion on the height tube (see chapter 6describing the Lucero equipment).
3.5.2 Sea return discriminator An important later development for the ASV radars was the sea return discrim- inator.
In heavy seas the sea return could extend out to several miles, dependent onthe sea conditions, and could saturate the PPI display.
This would make detection of targets at close range dif ﬁcult and required careful manipulation of the gain control when homing on targets.
For example, [ 13] reported that for ASV Mk.
III in a rough sea at 1000 ft altitude, returns could extend out to 11 nmi upwind and 7 nmi downwind.
In order to reduce the saturation effects on the PPI display, a sea return discriminator was introduced.
This consisted of a high-pass ﬁlter at the input to the video ampli ﬁer, which could be selected by the operator.
In March 1944, a CCDU report [ 14] described the results of trials to assess the tactical usefulness of sea return discriminators on ASV Mk.
VA, III and VI (see chapter 4for ASV Mk.
VI; ASV Mk.
VA was the USA AN/APS-2, a high-power version of ASV Mk.
V, discussed in chapter 8).
The discriminator circuit used on ASV Mk.
III is shown in ﬁgure 3.11.
It was a high-pass ﬁlter, with a low frequency −3 dB cut-off of about 40 kc/s.
It was reported that in moderate sea conditions the sea returns disappeared when the discriminator was switched on and in rough seas the returns became thinand scattered.
Land returns were also reduced.
It was also reported that signals normally swamped by sea returns were easily distinguished when the discriminator was used and that detection ranges were not signi ﬁcantly affected.
It was also noted that a good operator manipulating gain and brightness without the discriminator could get equivalent results when homing on a target.
It was recommended for ASV Mk.
III that the discriminator should be employed if the sea return extended beyond4.5 nmi.
The report also reminded operators that careful control of gain and contrast would still be required when homing on a target.
3.6 Detection performance of ASV Mk.
III Trials of the performance of ASV Mk.
IIIA in No.
172 Squadron, Chivenor, ﬂying Wellington XII with Leigh Light (taken from the pooled maintenance scheme of 172 Figure 3.11.
Sea return discriminator circuit.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-17 and 407 squadrons), were undertaken by CCDU in May 1943 [ 13], when the radar had been in service for only about two months.
Some aircraft from 172 and 407 squadrons are shown in ﬁgure 3.12.
It appears that the in-service detection performance of ASV Mk.
III was highly variable.
In particular, it was evident that the equipment at that time was quite unreliable and the RAF maintainers had difﬁculty in properly tuning and setting up the sets.
Over a total of 38 hours of trials there were 15 ﬂights involving 4 aircraft and 5 of those ﬂights had to be curtailed due to ASV unserviceability.
Operational radar sensitivity was routinely tested at the start of a mission by observing the detection range against Lundy Island off the north Devon coast (see chapter 4,ﬁgure 4.32).
This was not very convenient when ﬂying from Chivenor (in Devon) and the Isles of Scilly were proposed as an alternative target.
With the radar correctly tuned, Lundy Island could be detected at about 40 miles from 3000 ft, whilst the Isles of Scilly could be detected at up to about 30 miles.
It was stated that adetection range of 25 –30 miles on the Isles of Scilly should indicate a detection range of about 15 miles on a submarine, whilst ranges of 15 –20 miles against the Scillies would indicate a range of less than 10 miles on a submarine.
The setting up of the sets by the RAF maintainers seems to have been a particular problem, due to lack of experience in diagnosing faults and tuning the equipment on the ground.
The trials measured the detection performance of the radars asmaintained by the RAF and the same sets were then set up by TRE personnel and re-tested.
In the worst example, one radar ’s detection range against Lundy island improved by 360% after tuning by TRE and another radar improved by 70%.A range increase of 360% is equivalent to about 26 dB of improvement in sensitivity.

407 Squadron RCAF [©IWM FLM 1995].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 3-18 Maximum detection ranges of a correctly tuned radar against a fully-surfaced submarine (HMS H32 was used for the trials, a boat of 410 –500 tons displacement, with no gun deck) were reported to be about 20 miles with the submarine beam-on,but only about 5 miles when viewed end-on.
The variation in clutter return with wind direction was also noted.
It was found that in a rough sea (a gale) at 1000 ft altitude the upwind sea returns extended 11 miles whist the downwind sea returns only extended to about 5 or 6 miles.
This meant that in rough seas a submarine viewed end- on might would be more dif ﬁcult to detect due to the clutter return.
However, it was also reported that following tuition from TRE (a Mr Mould, see authors of reference [3]o fc h a p t e r 8) the radar operator was able to learn how to manipulate the controls to successfully home in to a target down to short range in a heavy sea.
The operator alsoreported that sometimes the target would disappear over an interval from 4 or 5 miles range down to about 2 miles range, before reappearing again.
A possible reason for this is discussed in chapter 7, looking at theoretical performance predictions.
It must be remembered that at that time there was very little knowledge of the characteristics of sea clutter or targets at S-band and these were quite new observations.
About one year later in August 1944, these trials were repeated by CCDU at RAF Angle using Wellington XIV and XII and Halifax II aircraft and radars as maintained by the RAF [ 15].
A considerable improvement in performance was observed, with the average detection range against Lundy Island from 3000 ft being 43.5 miles.
Detectionranges against submarines were comparable with those observed following tuning by TRE in the earlier trial [ 13].
This improvement was attributed to better experience of the RAF maintainers, combined with the provision of improved ground test equip-ment.
This CCDU report also included detailed operating instructions for the radar, showing how to tune the system in the air and manipulate the controls when homing.
These instructions included the need to check the local oscillator tuning every halfhour.
When convenient, tuning was undertaken by stopping the scanner on a large target at 15 –20 miles range and observing the return on the height tube, with gain reduced to ensure that the return was not saturating.
3.7 Conclusions The introduction of centimetric ASV was a major countermeasure to the use of theMetox radar warning receivers on U-boats.
As discussed in chapter 7ASV Mk.
III also produced better detection ranges than ASV Mk.
II.
Also, most importantly, nearly 360 °of continuous coverage could be obtained with a rapid update rate and much improved angular resolution.
As discussed in chapter 4, it was assumed that the Germans would soon introduce a warning receiver that operated at wavelengths around 9 cm and further improvements were sought to counter that possibility, resulting in ASV Mk.

VI 4.1 Requirement for ASV Mk.
VI In early 1944, ASV Mk.
VI (ARI 5568) went into service, followed soon by ASV Mk.
VIA (ARI 5571) and eventually by ASV Mk.
VIB (ARI 5604).
The background to the development of ASV Mk.
VI is given in a TRE report [ 1], dated April 1944.
The introduction of ASV Mk.
III into Leigh Light Wellingtons (see chapter 2, section 2.2.6) early in 1943 succeeded completely in countering the U-boats that were listening for transmissions on 1.5 m (using the Metox receiver [ 2]).
However, it was believed that it would probably take the enemy only a few months to extend the frequency of the search receiver.
In the event the FuG350 Naxos 1 receiver [ 3] became available for U-boats late in 1944, although with a detection range of onlyabout 8 km it was never as successful as Metox.
Prior to that, in anticipation of the provision of a centimetric warning receiver, a further change of frequency to X band (3.2 cm wavelength, 9240 Mc/s frequency) was considered but it was felt that thewarning receivers would again soon adapt and any advantage would be lost.
For this reason, combined with the lack of availability of X band radars for ASV use (see later discussion), it was decided to upgrade the S band equipment and to counter thelistening devices in another way.
Planning for ASV Mk.
VI was underway by 25 October 1943.
A memorandum of a meeting of the Air Ministry [ 4] recorded the plan to produce 25 sets by the end of 1943 and a further 75 sets by February 1944.
Incidentally, it was noted that automatic frequency control (AFC) was due to be introduced in the future (see discussion on ASV Mk.
VIB).
It was also noted that there was a shortage of DRcompasses for Wellingtons so that the North-up display used on H 2S Mk.
II could not be offered for ASV radars.
At that time, ASV Mk.
VIA was also being planned, with the new scanner being manufactured by Metropolitan Vickers, with 100 unitsdue for 31 March 1944.
The principle features of ASV Mk.
VI were an increase of peak transmitter power from 40 kW to 200 kW and the use of an attenuator to reduce the transmitted power doi:10.1088/978-1-6432-7066-1ch4 4-1 ªMorgan & Claypool Publishers 2018 when homing onto a target (see discussion on Vixen for ASV Mk.
II in chapter 2).
The increased power should have increased the noise-limited range of the radar by a factor of about 1.5.
Reduced microwave losses and other features were also expectedto further improve the range performance.
The increased power would also increase the range at which the U-boat warning receivers would detect the radar, which was potentially disadvantageous.
However, if there were suf ﬁcient aircraft in a search area it was postulated that U-boats could not afford to submerge at every long-range detection, but would only do so if the received signal power was increasing,consistent with an approaching aircraft.
To counter this, ASV Mk.
VI was ﬁtted with an attenuator (known as Vixen) that allowed the transmitted power to be reduced by the radar operator as the target was approached.
ASV Mk.
VIA, intended to replace ASV Mk.
VI, included the additional facility of being capable of locking-on to a target, providing accurate range and bearing measurements that would be automatically updated.
This information was providedto the pilot and to the Leigh Light operator.
The version for bulk production was intended to be ASV Mk.
VIB but delays in the design and manufacture meant that this radar was only just entering service in May 1945 when the war with Germanyended [ 5].
4.2 ASV Mk.
VI, ARI 5568 The main units used in ASV Mk.
VI were [ 1]: Modulator, type 158; Transmitter –receiver TR.
3519; Switch unit, type 207B; Waveform generator, type 34 or 35; Receiver, type R3553 or R3554; Indicator unit, type 163B or 162B; Scanning unit, type 67; Attenuator, type 53; Attenuator control unit, type 448; Tuning control unit, type 444; Heading control unit, type 218; Wavemeter type 1632 (echo box); Lucero, TR 3566 (45 Mc/s IF).
The waveform generator, switch unit, heading control unit and indicator unit were essentially the same as ASV Mk.
IIIB (including range indicated in nautical miles, without the slant-range curves, and a Leigh Light marker), although changesto the indicator unit are discussed below.
4.2.1 Scanner type 67 The scanner type 67 was similar to the scanner type 51 used on ASV Mk.
III.
However, the feed horn had been redesigned to reduce the downward radiation of the vertical polar diagram.
A comparison of the elevation patterns is shown inAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-2 ﬁgure 4.1.
The azimuth beamwidth was 10 °.
To accommodate the higher transmitter power a waveguide feed replaced the coaxial feeder used on ASV Mk.
III.
It was noted that the antenna achieved a VSWR of 1.3:1 or better, over wavelengthsbetween 9.05 cm and 9.15 cm, with a VSWR of 1.1:1 at 9.1 cm.
It is likely that using waveguide rather than a coax feed would have reduced the microwave losses, as well as handling a higher power.
A tubular feeder type 88 was also included, whichallowed the VSWR to be adjusted for the nominal centre frequency of an individual magnetron.
The scan speed of scanner type 67 was variable, using control unit type 477 (a 12 ohm variable resistor), over the range 40 –70 rpm, with a normal scanning speed of 60 rpm.
The scanner type 51 could scan at up to 90 rpm, which was considered too high.
4.2.2 Modulator type 158 This was similar to modulator type 64 used on ASV Mk.
III, but with an increased power output of 550 kW peak.
A bridge recti ﬁer generated a DC power supply of 7 kW and from this pules of 1 μs duration and recurrence frequency 666 c/s were formed using a CV125 spark gap and a DN39C delay line.
It is noted in [ 5] that modulator type 158 had considerable problems during its development.
There were several instances of ﬁre breaking out when the modulator was supplied with power from the type UKX generator ﬁtted on Wellington and Warwick aircraft.
The ﬁre danger, but not the risk of continual breakdowns, was eliminated at the end of August 1944 by repositioning certain insulating materials in the modulator.
A suitable generator, type UO, could not be made available for production before Ma rch 1945.
There was consideration given to delaying the whole ASV Mk.
VIA and VIB programmes, on which themodulator was also used, until that date.
In the event, it was decided to accept the unreliability of the unit while urgent steps were taken by TRE to mitigate the faults.
A revised design, modulator ty pe 158A was in production from the end of September 1944.
Figure 4.1.

VI and III.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-3 4.2.3 Transmitter receiver TR3519 The transmitter used a CV192 magnetron, outputting a typical peak power of 200 kW.
The pulse length and PRF were the same as used on ASV Mk.
III.
In ASV Mk.
III, the local oscillator was housed in the indicator unit, which also had the controls for adjusting the crystal mixer current and mechanically tuning theklystron.
Con ﬁdence in the stability of the klystron had improved and it was now housed remotely from the operator in the TR unit.
The mechanical tuning of the klystron was undertaken remotely by a motor, commanded from control unit type444.
The coupling to the klystron and mixer current were pre-set on the ground.
Figure 4.2shows control unit type 444, together with an example of its installation in a Wellington XIV [ 1].
The IF frequency was changed from 13.
5 Mc/s to 45 Mc/s, possibly because this made the design of the IF passband ﬁlters easier or to standardise the design.
The IF frequency of ASV Mk.
II and earlier centimetric AI radars was 45 Mc/s.The very early radar trials of RDF2 in 1936 [ 7]u s e da nE M It e l e v i s i o nr e c e i v e r as the IF ampli ﬁer.
These televisions used a tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver on the broadcast frequency of 45 Mc/s and this choice of IF seems to have beencontinued in subsequent designs .
TR.3519 included an IF head ampli ﬁer, type 2 3 A ,w h i c hw a sg a i nc o n t r o l l e di ns y n chronism with the receiver R3553 or R3554.
The TR switch was improved and was installed in waveguide, using a soft rhumbatron tube, CV179.
An anti-TR rhumbatron, CV179, was ﬁtted at the quarter wavelength position in a half wavelength tuning stub in the feed from the trans-mitter.
On transmit, both rhumbatrons ﬁred, feeding the transmitter pulse to the antenna.
On reception, both reverted to their low impedance state for the desired signals and the anti-TR rhumbatron tuning stub re ﬂected an open circuit towards the magnetron, preventing losses to the received signals.
This is illustrated in ﬁgure 4.3.
Figure 4.2.

III, arranged to operate on an IF of 45 Mc/s instead of 13.5 Mc/s.
The IF bandwidth was about 3.5 Mc/s.The unit could also be used for ASV Mk.
VIA and, using an adjustable link, H 2S Mk.
III.
The IF gain was controlled from the switch unit.
The detected video output from the receiver was fed to the indicator unit.
4.2.5 Attenuator, type 53 The attenuator divided the transmitter power between the scanner and a dummy load, in such a way as to present a constant impedance to the transmitter.
The SWR was maintained at better than 1.1:1, so that the transmitter was not pulled in frequency by more than 1 Mc/s.
Operation of the attenuator is illustrated in ﬁgure 4.5[8].
This consisted primarily of a T junction, one of which lead to the scanner and the other to the transmitter dummy load.
Inserted in these two branch arms were two closed sections ofwaveguide containing resonant loops which were linked together and which enabled the output of the transmitter to be divided in any desired proportion between the scanner and the dummy load.
When these loops were parallel to the axis of the waveguide, the side arm B(seeﬁgure 4.4) was effectively a wavelength long and since it was closed at its far end the effect was to produce a short circuit across bb.
The side arm Aon the other hand was 3/4 wavelength long and appeared as an open circuit at the plane aa.
Therefore, the effect at plane AAwas that of high impedance.
Consequently, the effect of AAat the plane C 1C3was equivalent to a short circuit, since C1C3was 3/4 of a wavelength from AA.
In this way the full power of the transmitter was fed to the scanner.
When the loops were normal to the axis of the waveguide the side arm Blooked like an open circuit at the plane bb.
This had the effect of looking like a short circuit at the plane C2C3.
The side arm Aon the other hand was effectively a ½ wavelength long and had the effect of producing a short circuit across aa.
Thus in this state all power was fed to the dummy load.
The impedances of the side arms Aand Balways had equal and opposite reactive components since they differed in length by a 1/4 wavelength and the two branch arms of the attenuator always had a total impedance equal to the impedance of the Figure 4.3.
TR switch and anti-TR switch arrangement.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-5 transmitter waveguide.
At any intermediate position of the resonant rings the transmitter power would be divided proportionally between the scanner and the dummy load.
The two resonant rings were ganged together and controlled by a motor (see ﬁgure 4.5), using control unit type 448, which is shown in ﬁgure 4.6.
This control unit consisted of an ‘M’motor transmitter directly driven by a control knob.
It had a dial giving an indication of the amount of power being radiated and a light whichindicated when full power was being radiated.
In early versions of the radar, the attenuator operated on both the transmitted and received signals.
This was not usually a problem when homing onto a target atshort range but would have required careful coordination of the attenuator and receiver gain controls.
In later versions of the radar the received signals were not attenuated.

This was similar to switch unit 207 used on ASV Mk.
III but the range curves have been removed from the range drum and the scale was marked in nautical miles.
The height control was replaced by the Leigh Light range marker control and the sea return discriminator switchreplaced the line of ﬂight marker switch.

III were related to the removal of the local oscillator.
The positions for the local oscillator output socket, the mixer current control, mixer current meter and the tuning control were blanked off.
Some of the controls previously available as pre-setadjustments (contrast, focus, shift etc) had been provided with knobs, perhaps indicating the need for more frequent adjustment than previously anticipated.
The similar indicator unit type 162C, used on ASV Mk.
VIB and VIC is shown inﬁgure 4.19.
4.2.8 Wavemeter type 1632 (echo box) The wavemeter was a high Q resonant cavity with a tuning plunger, fed with a small fraction of the transmitted pulse energy at the output of the transmitter.
When the cavity was resonant it produced a ringing response with a duration of about 20 μs, starting from zero range and extending about two miles.
It could be used to give anindication of the magnetron frequency or to produce an echo signal for tuning the klystron.
The latter application was particularly useful if strong stable targets were not available to set the tuning, which had to be undertaken regularly during operation of the radar.
The wavemeter as installed in a Wellington XIV can be seen in ﬁgure 4.2(b).
4.3 ASV Mk.
VIA, ARI 5571 As discussed above, the ASV Mk.
VIA [ 8] mainly differed from ASV Mk.
VI by the addition of a ‘lock–follow ’system.
This allowed the scanner to be stopped to point at a target, which could then be tracked in range and bearing.
The tracking systemalso incorporated a blind bombing facility, which was part of the Mark III ASV bombsight.
The principle units on ASV Mk.
VIA were as for ASV Mk, VI except for: Strobe unit, type 63; Strobe control unit, type 454 (or 454A); Ampli ﬁer type A.3578 (for antenna split switching); Pilot ’s indicator 10A/16113 (range and azimuth meter); Leigh Light indicator 5T/517; Scanning unit, type 68.
A block diagram of the main lock-follow functions in ASV Mk.
VIA is shown in ﬁgure 4.8.
The various units are described in more detail below.
4.3.1 Scanning unit, type 68 The lock –follow facility incorporated a new scanner, type 68, which replaced the type 67 used in ASV Mk.
VI.
The scanner could be rotated at up to 40 rpm or stopped and ‘inched ’to point at a target.
In [ 9] the CCDU recommended a scanner speed of 30 rpm for normal search operations.
When in lock –follow mode, the scanner could beAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-8 driven to track a target in azimuth.
The re ﬂector and rotating mechanism were largely unchanged but the waveguide feed was divided between two adjacent feed horns.
These horns if fed singly produced two beam positions, offset in azimuth by 5 °.
In each of the branches of the waveguide feed to the horns was placed a stubcontaining a resonant ring, and these two rings could be rotated in synchronism, the whole forming a variable waveguide divider capable of sharing the power across both feed horns.
The scanning mode was controlled by control unit type 454, discussedbelow.
In the auto position, the rings were rotated at a speed of 300 –450 rpm, causing the energy to be transferred in a continuously varying proportion between one horn and the other.
This resulted in a beam continuously scanning in azimuth over ±2.5 ° at a rate of between 300 and 450 scans per minute, or between 50 and 75 deg/s.
This is shown in ﬁgure 4.9.
This arrangement of rotatable resonant rings was similar to the method used in the attenuator to divide power between the scanner and the dummyload.
In the manual position, scanning was the same as on ASV Mk.
III and ASV Mk.
VI, with the transmitter power divided equally between the two horns, providing a single beam with no offset squint.
In the auto mode, the response from a target inthe beam would depend on its azimuth offset from the beam centre.
The target return signal was synchronised with the position of the splitter switch and used to drive the Figure 4.8.

This operation was achieved in ampli ﬁer type A3678.
Scanning unit type 68 is illustrated in ﬁgure 4.10.
The split waveguide feeds to the two horns are clearly seen.
4.3.2 Strobe unit type 63 The signals from the radar receiver were ampli ﬁed and strobed in order to obtain bearing (D/F), velocity and range information on a target.
The DC misalignment voltage fed to the ampli ﬁer was also fed to the AGC valve, the anode current of which controlled the screen voltages in the IF and head ampli ﬁers during ‘Auto ’ operation.
These functions were undertaken in strobe unit type 63, illustrated inﬁgure 4.11.
The voltage derived from the velocity measurement was used to control the position of the strobe, allowing it to follow a target as the range reduced.
The rangemeasurement was fed to the pilot ’s indicator where it actuated the range meter, calibrated in nautical miles.
If the signal disappeared the scanner and strobe remained ﬁxed for one or two seconds, so that if the target reappeared the equipment could have re-locked itself.
The AGC was engaged when the scanner was stopped and automatically reduced the gain to maintain the signal at a constant level.
In addition, the strobe unit provided the timing markers at 3 miles and 1 ½ miles (i.e.
6250 and 3750 ft) for the range lamps on the strobe control unit and the bomb release signal, according to the stick length setting.
The timing for bomb release was Figure 4.10.
Scanning unit type 68, (a) [ 8] and (b) [ 10].
Figure 4.9.
Waveguide feed arrangement for split beams [ 6].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-10 achieved by a reversing electronic stopwatch system.
The strobe timed the interval between 6250 ft and 3750 ft, at which point the stopwatch reversed and the bombs were released after an interval equal to the time of fall before the stopwatch reached zero again.
The time of fall was set manually into the bombsight, as were correctionsfor ballistics and stick length.
The blind bombsight calculated the range from the target at which to release the bombs.
The line of attack was controlled by the pilot ﬂying the aircraft while observing the bearing of the target as revealed by the pilot ’s azimuth indicator.
Calibration of the bombsight was done in advance on training runs with dummy bombs.
The exact timing of bomb release was dependent on bomb type and airspeed.
4.3.3 Strobe control unit type 454 The strobe control unit is illustrated in ﬁgure 4.12.
It had the following controls and indicators [ 1].
The inching control (a push-over key switch) which controlled the position of the scanner, with the central position for stop and the scanner rotating clockwise or anticlockwise when the switch was moved to the right or left, respectively.
The manual strobe control, which varied the position of the strobe along the height tube time base.
This allowed individual targets at ranges up to 10 miles to be selected, provided their echoes were separate on the time base and notmerged with sea return.
A manual –automatic switch, used in conjunction with the manual strobe control, allowing the strobe to be manually controlled when in the manualposition and initiating the locking circuits when the auto position was selected.
Figure 4.11.
Strobe unit type 63 [ 1].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-11 The mirror speed control controlled the rotation speed of the mirror, to a maximum of 40 rpm.
The velocity meter registered when an echo had been locked-on and the range was decreasing, determined by the slant range, the height and the aircraftspeed.
The altitude setting knob was continuously variable from 50 to 1000 ft and was only used on a bombing run, when the height could be set at any timeduring a bombing run.
The stick length control was provided to afford facilities for dropping sticks of bombs of different lengths.
In position ‘0’a single bomb would be released at a time when it should hit the target, assuming no errors.
For a stick of bombs intended to straddle a target, the 50, 100, 150 and 200 ft positions indicated the range that the ﬁrst bomb would be dropped in front of the target.
The range lamps operated at ﬁxed distances: green on at 3 miles, off at 1 ½ mile; amber on at 6250 ft, off at 3750 ft; red on just after amber was on and off when the bomb was released.
To initiate a Leigh Light attack on a target at a range of less than 10 miles, the operator would stop the scanner to point at a target, using the inching control.
Therange strobe would then be set using the height tube indicator and the auto –manual switch was set to auto.
The target would then be tracked in range and azimuth.
In order to prevent saturation of the IF ampli ﬁer, which would prevent tracking, Figure 4.12.
Strobe control unit type 454.
Altitude control, range lamps and stick length control were associated with the blind bombing attack system; (a) [ 6], (b) [ 1].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-12 automatic gain control (AGC) was introduced.
When the target range was reduced to 1 mile, the Leigh Light was switched on.
Using the blind bombing attack facility, the pilot would ﬂy the aircraft on the target ’s bearing at a constant height between 500 ft and 1000 ft and the bombs would be released automatically.
The pilot had an override switch ‘should the target turn out to be friendly ’[1].
4.3.4 Leigh Light indicator and pilot ’s indicator When locked onto a target, the bearing of the target relative to the line of ﬂight (up to ±30 °) and the target range were fed to an azimuth meter in the pilot ’s indicator, seeﬁgure 4.13.
This indicator had a small lamp that was illuminated when the strobe was ‘locked on ’.
A further signal was provided to the Leigh Light indicator ﬁgure 4.14.
This had a main pointer with magslip control from the searchlight and a small pointer attached to a disc on the periphery of the display, which was Figure 4.13.

4.4 ASV Mk.
VIB, ARI 5604 ASV Mk.
VIB was intended for bulk production, replacing ASV Mk.
VI and ASV Mk.
VIA.
It was initially conceived in 1943, together with the interim Mk.
VI and VIA solutions.
However, problems with design and manufacture meant that ASVMk.
VIB had only just entered service with the ﬁrst of the Warwicks ﬁtted with it for No.
179 squadron in May 1945, as the war with Germany ended.
ASV Mk.
VIB had mostly the same features as ASV Mk.
VIA.
It also included automatic frequency control (AFC) with the introduction of transmitter –receiver TR 3519B and an adjustable automatic attenuator rate control (attenuator type 58 and attenuator control unit type 492).
Considerable dif ﬁculties were encountered in developing attenuator type 58.
In addition, problems associated with modulator type 158, discussed above, and initial dif ﬁculties with scanner type 68 contributed to the considerable delays to the programme.
The units for ASV Mk.
VIB [ 6] that were different from ASV Mk.
VIA included: Scanning unit type 68A or type 68B; Indicator, rotation assembly, type 2 or 3 (Leigh Light indicator; type 2 for scanning unit type 68A with ﬂexible drive; type 3 for scanning unit type 68B with magslip drive); Attenuator type 58; Control unit type 492 (attenuator rate control); Transmitter receiver TR3519A (standard installation) or TR 3519B (with AFC); Control unit type 498 (tuning control and AFC, for use with TR 3519B); Receiver R.3585; Ampli ﬁer A3586.
A block diagram of ASV Mk.
VIB is shown in ﬁgure 4.15 [6].
4.4.1 AFC The need for regular manual tuning of the klystron local oscillator was an additional load on the radar operator and a cause of loss of performance when done incorrectly or neglected.
Manual tuning was also very dif ﬁcult over a calm sea in the absence of strong targets or land return, although the wavemeter (echo box) could be used forthis purpose.
The advent of a klystron that could be tuned by altering its re ﬂector voltage meant that automatic tuning could be introduced.
TR 3519B in ASV Mk.
VIB included an automatic frequency control (AFC) capability.
A highly attenuated sample (about 76 dB of attenuation) of the transmitted pulse was input to a second mixer and the beat frequency between the magnetron and klystron local oscillator was obtained.
This signal was passedAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-14 Figure 4.15.
Schematic block diagram of ASV Mk.
VIB [ 6].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-15 to the AFC unit (amplifying unit type 244) which contained a discriminator designed to output a voltage dependent on the sign and magnitude of the deviation of beat frequency from the central IF of 45 Mc/s.
This voltagew a su s e dt oc o n t r o lt h er e ﬂector voltage of the local oscillator klystron, CV237, which was a low voltage re ﬂector klystron specially designed for use in AFC circuits.
A local oscillator error of 15 Mc/s could be corrected to within about 0.25 Mc/s of the correct IF, for a typical local oscillator s ensitivity.
The need for a residual control voltage meant that a residual error of about 0.25 Mc/s was achieved in normal operation.
The discriminator could not correct beat frequencies below 38 Mc/s or above 52 Mc/s.
When this occurred, the local oscillator would be made to sweepover its full frequency range until a suitable beat frequency was obtained.
At that point the sweep was terminated and the discriminator regained control.
In addition a manual control was also provided that could override the AFC system.Operator control of the AFC system was achieved using control unit type 498, ﬁgure 4.16.
4.4.2 Attenuator type 58 The need to continuously adjust the attenuator control during a homing run was another load on the operator.
ASV Mk.
VIB incorporated attenuator type 58, ﬁgure 4.17, that could be adjusted to increase attenuation at a ﬁxed rate.
The rate of increase was set by the operator using control unit type 492, illustrated in ﬁgure 4.18.
The indicating lamps showed when the attenuator was in use and when zeroattenuation was selected.
As mentioned above, there were signi ﬁcant problems with the development of attenuator type 58.
Moreover, by 1945 the Germans had introduced the schnorkel,which could only be detected by radar at very short range.
Use of the attenuator was expected to be counterproductive and it was also uncertain if the Germans were maintaining a search receiver watch at that time.
In view of the productiondifﬁculties, the requirement for attenuator type 58 was cancelled in February Figure 4.16.
AFC and tuning control unit type 498 [ 6].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-16 1945, but 200 were kept in reserve and assessment by ASWDU continued in case the tactical situation changed [ 5].
4.4.3 Indicating unit type 162C This indicating unit was similar to indicating unit 162B used on ASV Mk.
VIA and is illustrated in ﬁgure 4.19.
The local oscillator was no longer housed in the indicator unit and the unwanted controls and output socket were blanked off.

IIIC was installed in Sunderland aircraft, with early CCDU trials taking place by August 1943 [ 19].
By June 1944 the ASV Mk.
VIC, based on ASV Mk.
VI, was also operational [ 20].
This radar used the same waveguide feeds, under-wing scanners and waveguide switching as ASV Mk.
IIIC.
A block diagram of ASV Mk.

The waveguide switch and two scanners were the main change from ASV Mk.
VI.
The installation of ASV Mk.
VIC, ARI 5634, is described here.
The installation of ASV Mk.
IIIC would have been similar and the use of waveguide feeds and switches in ASV Mk.
IIIC meant that the upgrade to higher power was more straightforward.The main units of ASV Mk.

The radars in the CCDU and ASWDU trials referenced here did not have AFC, but appeared to have Attenuator Type 58, with an adjustable attenuation rate control.
It should be noted that no attenuator isillustrated in ﬁgure 4.25 or the associated photographs in ﬁgure 4.26.
The installation of the radar in a Sunderland Mk.
III is illustrated in ﬁgures 4.27– 4.29 [20].
The waveguide switch unit is shown in more detail in ﬁgure 4.30.
The layout of the operator controls was criticised by ASWDU.
In a previous report on ASV Mk.
IIIC [ 21] it had been recommended that the Switch unit be installed to the left of the indicator unit, with the range drum vertical and as near to the table aspossible to facilitate use of the range marker control (at the bottom of the switch unit).
In [ 20] it was recommended that a guard be placed over the automatic attenuator control, to prevent accidental loss of power output.
A continuing problem with the antenna tilt and aircraft trim was also reported, with aAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-20 Figure 4.24.

No heading control adjustment was provided and this was set up on the ground.
It was recommended that tuning be undertaken with the echo box (wavemeter) toavoid stopping the scanner to point at a strong target (such as land), as this could cause desynchronization of the scanners.
Various aspects of the performance were reported in [ 20].
The maximum detection ranges achieved were slightly greater than those measured with ASV Mk.
VI in a Wellington.
Attempts to use a schnorkel buoy to represent a schnorkelgave detection ranges of only about 3 nmi, against an expected range of better than 6 nmi.
In retrospect, this highlighted the contribution to the signal of a real schnorkel of the wake and wave splashing seen with a submarine underway,together with the ﬂuctuations in depth keeping that would have given periodic increases (and fades) in the radar return.
A sea return discriminator was ﬁtted and found to reduce the extent of the sea return.
However, in common with other reportsof its use, it was noted that while it might be of some bene ﬁt to an inexperienced operator, it did not improve short-range detection in the hands of an experienced operator correctly controlling the receiver gain.

4.7 ASV Mk.
VI performance Trials of ASV Mk.
VI undertaken by TRE [ 1] in early 1944 gave the performance shown in table 4.1.
It was also reported that trials by CCDU with service operators achieved an average range of 19 miles from 1000 ft on a surfaced submarine, in arange of sea conditions.
Some of the locations referenced in these trials reports are shown in ﬁgure 4.32.
In April 1944 CCDU reported [ 12] on trials to assess the performance of ASV Mk.
VI and to provide recommendations on the use of the Vixen attenuator.
It was reported that the use of Vixen did make it very dif ﬁcult for a listening-receiver operator to determine if the radar was approaching.
However, operating the Figure 4.31.
A Sunderland Mk.
V showing one of the ASV scanner radomes [©IWM ATP 13694B].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-25 attenuator controls required much concentration and practice to achieve an appropriate increase in attenuation as range decreased.
This was made more dif ﬁcult because the attenuator also affected the received signals, which could cause targets to be lost on the PPI at longer ranges.
This feature was exploited to help the operatorset the correct attenuation, by attempting to keep the target just visible as range reduced.
At very short ranges and in high sea states, the radar gain control also had to be adjusted.
Later versions of the attenuator only operated on the transmittedsignal and a system (attenuator type 58) was introduced on ASV Mk.
VIB for automatically increasing attenuation with time, at a rate selectable by the operator.
In terms of detection ranges, it was noted that sea returns were, as expected, more extensive on ASV Mk.
VI than on ASV Mk.
III.
This required more careful use of the gain control during searching.
At short ranges the screen could become saturated and it was recommended at that time that the radar be urgently upgraded with a seaTable 4.1.

Detection ranges of ASV Mk.
VI against a submarine were typically about 19 nmi at 1000 ft, only slightly greater than for ASV Mk.
III (after TRE maintenance, as reported for ASV Mk.
III [ 13] and discussed in chapter 3).
Detection ranges of ASV Mk.
VI reported for Lundy Island, typically 62 nmi at 2000 ft, and Isles of Scilly, typically 19 nmi at 1000 ft, were on average 40% greater than for ASV Mk.
III.
It may be noted that since ASV Mk.
VI had 7 dB more power, the noise-limited range might have been expected to be about 50% greater, even without accounting for reduced microwave losses of the later systems.
However,detection of submarines may often have been clutter-limited, when the increased transmitter power would have had no appreciable effect.
In November 1944, CCDU conducted trials to compare ASV Mk.
III and VI [ 9].
The ‘sensitivity ’of the radar on each trial was determined from the detection range of Grassholm Island (see ﬁgure 4.32).
The mean sensitivities were 23.5 nmi for ASV Mk.
III and 38.5 nmi for ASV Mk.
VI.
It was reported that the sensitivity of ASVMk.
III was quite variable over the trials, ranging from 19 nmi to 29 nmi, representing a variation of about 7.5 dB.
Conversely, ASV Mk.
VI showed a spread between 37 nmi and 39.75 nmi, representing a variation of only 1.25 dB.
Thedetection ranges from each trial were corrected to the mean radar sensitivity over the trial period and the resulting average comparisons between ASV Mk.
III and ASV Mk.
VI are shown in ﬁgures 4.33 and4.34.
Figure 4.33 compares detection ranges for a U class submarine, either beam-on or end-on to the radar.
Figure 4.34 compares the results for Lundy Island and the radar training (RT) buoy, both approached from the West.
The overall conclusion was that ASV Mk.
VI provided a60% increase in detection ranges, which represents about 8.2 dB better sensitivity.
It was also reported that sea returns extended to 75% greater range, which would have been equivalent to 9.7 dB improvement in sensitivity.
7 dB improved sensitivity canbe attributed to the increased transmitter power.
Reduced microwave losses, due to the use of waveguide feeds rather than coaxial cable, combined with a better matched T/R switching arrangement, will also have contributed to increasedsensitivity.
In addition, it seems likely that a slower scanner speed (30 rpm) would Figure 4.33.
Detection range versus height for ASV Mks III and VI against a U-class submarine [ 9].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-27 have been used on ASV Mk.
VI, compared with the ﬁxed scanner speed of 60 rpm on ASV Mk.
III; this could have contributed about 1.5 dB in additional non-coherent integration gain against thermal noise.
In any event, these results were better than those reported in earlier CCDU reports 44/24 [ 12] and 44/35 [ 14].
In addition to the improved sensitivity, the variable scanner speed (see comment above) of ASV Mk.
VI was considered an advantage when searching and a speed of 30 rpm was recommended for normal use.
4.7.1 ASV Mk.
VIA performance By 1944 an increasing number of U-boats were being equipped with schnorkel (later referred to as snorts in the UK) allowing them to charge their batteries while still submerged.
There was clearly a strong requirement to be able to detect a schnorkel by radar, but achievable ranges were usually quite small.
It is noted in [ 15] that often at that time in daylight schnorkels were more readily detected by eye, as they often emitted smoke as well as having a prominent wake.
Assessment of the performance of ASV Mk.
VIA was reported by ASWDU in February 1945 [ 10].
Compared with earlier trials of ASV Mk.
VI by CCDU [ 9] the schnorkel was seen as an important target.
Detection ranges against submarineswere, as expected, comparable with those reported for ASV Mk.
VI [ 9].
Against a mock schnorkel ﬁtted to a ‘U’class submarine, submerged and under way, typical detection ranges were 5 –6 nmi.
The sea state was typically Beaufort 2 –3, but it should be noted that the extent of sea returns reported was about 1 –3 nmi, so that initial detections of the schnorkels would have been achieved in noise-limited conditions.
The tactical use of the lock –follow system was also assessed.
It was noted that if altitude was reduced rapidly from patrol height on initial contact, locking was possible on large targets such as a submarine beam-on.
However, on smaller targets such as a schnorkel or a submarine end-on the reduction in heightalso reduced the size of the echo and locking was impaired.
This seems to have been due in part to the nose-down attitude of the aircraft when losing height, causing the target to move out of the centre of the antenna beam, which was not stabilised.
On Figure 4.34.
Detection range versus height for ASV Mks III and VI against the radar training buoy and Lundy Island [ 9].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-28 making a contact, the pilot would turn the aircraft to place the target dead ahead.
Once lock had been achieved, it was recommended that the pilot ﬂy the aircraft on the directional gyro, using the range-azimuth meter (see ﬁgure 4.13) to observe movement of the target.
Steady movement of the target in azimuth would indicate the relative drift, allowing the pilot to correct the course with the appropriate aim-off to achieve a steady target bearing reading.
Instructions to the Leigh Light operator on the range to the target were given by the radar operator, as the pilot was fully occupied.
The azimuth indicator for the Leigh Light operator (see ﬁgure 4.14) was considered a de ﬁnite advantage.
It was noted that it was very dif ﬁcult for a schnorkel to be seen at short range at night using the Leigh Light and it was recommended that the blind bombsight wouldbe the best method for attacking schnorkels.
It was noted that to lock on to a small target such as a schnorkel it had to be at least 1 ½ miles clear of the sea returns.
Attempts to lock on to a steady target within the sea returns were usuallyconfounded by the operation of the AGC.
It was also recommended that the attenuator should not be used when attacking a schnorkel but to rely on the AGC to maintain a suitable signal strength.
The improved sensitivity of ASV Mk.
VI meant that the operator had to exercise continuous control of the gain during search.
It was noted in [ 9] that this could be particularly important when searching for schnorkels.
As discussed above, detectionof schnorkels was dif ﬁcult and detection ranges could be quite short.
It was particularly important that the radars were operated at peak ef ﬁciency, and that losses in sensitivity due to poor maintenance or tuning were minimised.
Thisproblem was further addressed in TRE Report T1863 [ 11], describing trials under- taken in March 1945 with ASV Mk.
VI and VIA in Wellington aircraft of Coastal Command.
TRE assessed the sensitivity of in-service radars and concluded that, forthe 19 aircraft measured, the average sensitivity was 9 dB below optimum and the worst was 18 dB down.
Of 13 serviceable transmitters examined, 6 were more than 4 dB down, with the worst 8.5 dB below optimum.
The greatest single cause of poorsensitivity was the ‘crystal valve ’(the silicon mixer diode), which on average contributed to a loss of 2.5 dB.
Stocks of spare crystals were also found to be below speci ﬁcation, probably because of exposure to high RF ﬁelds.
It was found that when three crystals were placed on the ground in the radar antenna beam at a distance of 60 ft from the scanner, two of them lost 3 dB in sensitivity.
The other causes of poor sensitivity were due to the use of variable and frequency selectivepermanent echoes for setting up and aligning the radars.
Setting up the radars was very complex with many components requiring tuning on the ground to obtain a good match (e.g.
the T/R cell, the anti-T/R cell, the mixer cavity, the klystron localoscillator coarse tuning, antenna VSWR etc).
Before the incorporation of AGC, the operator also had to frequently adjust the local oscillator tuning, to compensate for thermal drift of the magnetron (transmitter) and klystron (local oscillator) frequen-cies.
All this was combined with unreliable electronics, with units of the radar regularly going unserviceable, and general lack of experience among the operators and maintainers.
It is not a surprise that operational performance was highlyvariable.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-29 Following on from TRE Report T1863 [ 11], a further set of measurements of ASV Mk.
VI and VIA were undertaken in July 1945 and reported in TRE Report T1894 [ 16].
These measurements were intended to determine the performance stability of ASV Mk.
VI and VIA on an operational squadron.
It was found that 23% of aircraft needed attention after 10 days and 41% after 20 days.
A change in crystal resistance occurred in 9 out of 10 cases in which sensitivity dropped and was constant in 10 out of 12 cases where the sensitivity remained constant.
It was recommended that daily crystal checks be undertaken, with full sensitivity checks ateach minor inspection (presumably these occurred every few days) and whenever a TR box was changed.
4.8 Improvements to ASV Mk.
VI Over the course of time, many improvements to these radars were introduced.
Somehave already been discussed, such as the attenuator being applied only to the transmitted signals and the provision of automatic increase of attenuation during arun.
However, some improvements that were applied to H 2S sets, such as slant-to- plan range correction of the PPI display and roll-stabilised scanners, were not incorporated in ASV Mk.
III or ASV Mk.
VI.
An important feature, especially on ASV Mk.
VI, was the introduction of the operator-selected sea discrimination circuit.
As noted in [ 12] this was regarded as essential on ASV Mk.
VI due to the higher levels of sea return than for ASV Mk.
III.
In [ 17] in March 1944, trials of a discrimina tor circuit were undertaken for ASV Mks VA, III and VI (see chapter 3for discussion on ASV Mk.
III).
However, at that time few trials were actually undertaken on ASV Mk.
VI, due to the limited availability of aircraft.
Further trials were undertaken by ASWDU in 1945 [ 18] of an ‘improved ’discriminator, assessed in ASV Mk.
VI and VIA in three Wellington Mk.
XIV aircraft, with rada rs having sea return discriminators modi ﬁed by TRE.
The modi ﬁcations were intended to improve the video response of the indicator and give improved discr imination between small targets and sea returns.
It was noted that the use of the discriminator was of great assistance in homing onto a target.
It was reported that it was only of slight assistance in search operations, but it was also reported that its use gave no signi ﬁcant decrease in detection range against a schnorkel.
In the se trials, performance against schnor- kels was assessed using a dummy schnor kel on a submarine.
Average detection ranges were 4.2 nmi at 500 ft and 5.2 nmi at 1000 ft, with similar results both withand without the discriminator.
Figure 4.35 show the effects of the discriminator when ﬂying upwind, crosswind and downwind at 2000 ft, on range scale 30/10 and a moderate to rough sea (Beaufort 4 or 5).
The reduction in the extent of the seareturn is clear, together with a reduction in the intensity of land returns (e.g.
ﬁgure 4.35(e) and (f)).
The receiver IF bandwidth of ASV Mk.
VI was about 3.5 Mc/s, with a pulse length of 1 μs.
Dependent on the actual pulse shape and length, an ideal matched ﬁlter would have a bandwidth closer to 1 Mc/s.
The broader IF response was used to provide some margin of error when tuning the klystron and to allow some frequencyAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-30 drift of the magnetron without having to retune too often.
In July 1945 ASWDU reported on a trial of a narrow bandwidth receiver for ASV Mk.
VI [ 22].
The IF ampli ﬁer was re-tuned to give a bandwidth closer to 2 Mc/s.
This would have been a better match to the transmitted pulse and should have improved the noise-limited Figure 4.35.

VI, looking into wind, crosswind and downwind; Left hand column, discriminator OUT; Right hand column discriminator IN [ 17].Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 4-31 sensitivity by about 2.5 dB.
Indeed, it was reported that the detection range against a small target was slightly increased, alth ough there was an accompanying increase in the range of sea returns.
The PPI picture was also more clearly de ﬁned.
The main problem was that tuning of the local oscillator became much more critical and had to be adjusted more frequently to cope with the magnetron frequency drift.
It was recommended that the narro wer IF should not be incorporated in ASV Mk.
VI but should be considered for future designs when automatic frequency c o n t r o l( A F C )c o u l db eu s e dt oe a s et h et u n i n gd i f ﬁculties.

VII The original H 2S Mks I and II operated at a wavelength of 9 cm.
However, H 2SM k III and most subsequent models operated at 3 cm, which provided better angular resolution and hence better ground mapping quality.
H 2S Mk III was operational with the RAF Bomber Command Path ﬁnder Force by December 1943 but ASV developments based on H 2S in the UK remained at 9 cm.
ASV operation at 3 cm was considered and production of 3 cm equipment, based on H 2S Mk III was being planned in October 1943.
This was recorded in ‘The Minutes of a Special meeting held in Room 71/II, Air Ministry, Whitehall on Wednesday 27th October 1943 at 1545 hours ’[1], marked ‘Most Secret ’.
This meeting was chaired by Sir Robert Renwick, Bt, (Controller of Communications, Air Ministry) and attended by about 30 others, including Dr A C B Lovell, TRE.
At this meeting it was agreed that 200 3cm equipments would be produced for four squadrons, three for BomberCommand and one for Coastal Command (ASV Mk VII).
However, matters did not proceed in line with this plan.
In his book Echoes of War [2], chapter 19, Sir Bernard Lovell describes being called to a meeting at the Air Ministry on the afternoon of Wednesday 27 October.
This meeting was chaired by the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sir Norman Bottomley and attended by Sir Robert Renwick and many others, including Sir Robert Watson-Watt.
At this meeting Lovell states that it was agreed that 50 3cm sets would be reserved for Coastal Comm and.
However, he also notes that Bomber Command was ‘enraged ’by this decision.
This meeting ev idently immediately preceded the planning meeting, minuted in [ 1], that set out the equipment to be produced.
However, Lovell states that by the tim e he had returned to TRE in Malvern that evening, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris (C-in-C Bomber Command) hadtelephoned the Prime Minister and had the decision reversed.
In the copy of the minutes [ 1] held in the National Archives, in an RAF ﬁle folder relating to ASV Mk VI Policy, the section on ‘3 cm Equipment ’h a sb e e nd r a w nt h r o u g hi np e n c i l , doi:10.1088/978-1-6432-7066-1ch5 5-1 ªMorgan & Claypool Publishers 2018 in conjunction with various other contem poraneous comments in the margins on other matters.
The equipment proposed for ASV Mk VII (ARI 5569) [ 1], included: Scanner type 66; TR unit TR.3555; Modulator type 174; Waveform generator 34 or 35; Receiver and tuning unit 3553 or 3554; Indicator type 162B or 163B; Switch unit type 207B; Tuning control type 444; Lucero type TR.3566.
ASV Mk VII plans included a Fishpond indicator [ 1,2], but did not include an attenuator or lock –follow capability.
Indicator type 162B, switch unit 207B, receiver 3553 and tuning control 444 were also used in ASV Mk.
VI (see chapter 4).
A prototype installation of ASV Mk VII was tested by CCDU in 1944 in a Wellington Mk XIV aircraft, as reported in [ 3].
It was noted that the radar had very similar controls to those for ASV Mk III, apart from the position of the tuning knob and a control to alter the scanner speed, as on ASV Mk VIA.
Conclusions at that stage were that sensitivity compared favourably with ASV Mk.
III but was greatly inferior to ASV Mk V and Mk VI (ASV Mk V was a US S-band radar (ASG.1) ﬁtted in Liberator bombers).
It was also found that the sensitivity of the radar varied greatly during the trials and also consistently deteriorated over the course of each trial (often by 5 or 6 dB, as measured by variations in the detection ranges of Grassholm Island).
The cause of these problemsappears to have been excessive drift of the CV208 magnetron and dif ﬁculty in retuning the receiver during ﬂight.
Towards the end of the trial period ‘a new type of CV208 ’was received from TRE and this appeared to be much more stable in operation.
The CV208 magnetron operated at 9370 Mc/s and had a typical peak power of 25 kW.
It was noted that land returns were better de ﬁned than with S-band equipment but the ‘pin-point ’deﬁnition of target returns made them rather dif ﬁcult to distinguish from sea clutter.
It was also noted that banking of the aircraft by more than 5 °or 6 ° caused total loss of signal and ‘bumpy weather ’could cause the signal returns to be intermittent.
This was due to the lack of roll stabilisation of the scanner and would have been more noticeable on the X-band equipment than for S-band, due to the narrower azimuth and elevation beamwidths.
Finally, the trials reported anincreased sensitivity to interference from rain clouds but these returns could be distinguished due to their ‘vagueness ’.
There was some concern that the presence of rain might make coast recognition more dif ﬁcult at X-band.
Following the introduction of the schnorkel in U-boats during 1944, there was renewed interest in the use of X-band for ASV [ 2].
It was not clear at that time that X-band would prove more suitable than S-band for the detection of schnorkel (seediscussion in chapter 7) but the schnorkel was recognised as a serious threat.
In theAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 5-2 event, the war ended before this threat became signi ﬁcant but it may also be noted that post-war ASV development for Coastal Command continued with ASV Mk VII.
ASV Mk.
VIIA [ 4] was installed In the Lancaster GR.3 maritime reconnais- sance aircraft that were in operation from 1946 to 1954.

III signals in the 1.5 m band to be accessed.
It was used on H 2S, ASV Mk.
III and VI (generically ASV.S), ASV.X and AI.X (ASV.X referred to X-band ASV equipmentdeveloped for the Fleet Air Arm, such as ASV Mk.
XI on Sword ﬁsh aircraft; AI.X referred to X-band Air Interception radars on ﬁghters).
Lucero was not designed to work on any American variety of centimetric equipment, although equivalentsystems were developed by the Americans.
Lucero Mk I was developed to interrogate beacons and IFF Mk III on 176 Mc/s, so that existing coastal beacons could be used.
Provision for operation with the BeamApproach Beacon System (BABS) was made by enabling the receiver only to be switched to 173.5 Mc/s, the frequency of the ASV/BA beacons.
It soon became clear that too many systems were being deployed for the capacity of the 176 Mc/s channel,with spectrum overcrowding.
The beacon channel was therefore separated from the IFF channel for Lucero Mk.
II.
The Rebecca [ 7]b a n do n2 1 4 –234 Mc/s, with ﬁve channels, was chosen, although the Lucero Mk.
II design also retained 176 Mc/s foruse when IFF was required.
The essential components of a Lucero installation are shown in ﬁgure 6.1[3].
Lucero incorporated a 500 W transmitter, pulse counting down and modulation circuits and the input section of a receiver.
It also contained a mechanically driven aerial switch so that the two receiving aerials could be employed to achieve a split beam.
It was housed in a container measuring 9 ″×8″×10″and weighed about 33 lb.
In 1943 there were three varieties of Mk.
I and three varieties of Mk.
II, as shown in table 6.1.

The tuning of the exact frequencies in each range was done on the ground.
Frequency changing of the Mk.
II receiver was achieved by changing coils, using two rotating turrets.
Each turret contained four adjustable brass-cored coils, with one turret for the mixer and one forthe local oscillator.
It was noted [ 3] that the design of these turrets caused considerable dif ﬁculty, especially the moving contacts.
The Mk.
II transmitter used one turret, of the same design, with four pre-set condensers.
It was also noted in[3] that ‘immense trouble ’was experienced in the design of the moving contacts for this turret.
These contacts had to carry peak currents of up to 20 A and early designs broke down within a few minutes.
Air breakdown across the transmitter capacitorswas also encountered.
At the time of writing reference [ 3], February 1943, redesign of these aspects was still continuing.
The Lucero equipment had two antennas, one on each side of the aircraft.
Transmissions were synchronised with the radar using a PRF of 220 c/s.
Interrogation pulses of 5 μs length were transmitted alternately from the left and right antenna, switching every 25 ms, so that 4 or 5 pulses were transmitted from each antenna in turn.
The same antennas were used to receive the beacon responses, which were typically about 15 μs in length.
The responses received were mixed into the radar IF ampli ﬁer and omni-directional responses displayed on the radar PPI.
An indication of direction (left or right) could also be displayed on the height tube.
This was achieved by taking the video output from the radarand feeding it back to the Lucero receiver.
Here the signals were switched so that signals from the left-hand antenna de ﬂected the height tube trace to the left and signals from the right-hand antenna de ﬂected signals to the right.
The difference in amplitude gave an indication of bearing of the beacon responses.
Beacon range could be measured from the height tube or PPI.
The use of a common aerial for transmit and receive caused some losses due to impedance mismatches and feederlosses, with about 0.7 dB loss of transmitter power and about 2 dB reduction in received signal.
Using the beam approach beacon system (BABS), only one antenna was used on the aircraft.
The BABS transponder on the ground had a split beam and transmitted alternately on each beam.
The two beams transmitted ﬁxed length pulses (possibly about 5 μs) but with one beam transmitting for a period of 0.2 s and the other for 1.2 s, known as dot and dash signals, respectively [ 4].
The signal was displayed on the height tube, usually on just one side of the display.
If approaching on the dash side of the beacon, the display would show a response of duration 1.2 s, followed by a weakerTable 6.2.

When exactly on the centre line of approach, the two bursts of signals would appear to have equal strength.
In an alternative blind approach system used in the Lucero II system [ 5] the beacon transmitted bursts (about 1/20 s duration) of pulses of different length from its two beams.
The dash pulses were about 10 μs long and the dot pulses about 3 μs.
The Lucero equipment processed these through both antennas, providing both a range and a bearing estimate of the beacon from either of the dash or dot returns.
The relative magnitude of the dash and dot returns also gave an indication of thedirection from which the beacon was being approached, with equi-signal power being received on the direct line of approach.
There were two different aerial types used for Lucero, aerial aircraft type 301 and aerial aircraft type 184.
Type 301 was a horizontal quarter wave swept back at 45 °, mounted on the skin of the aircraft and covering 172 –189 Mc/s.
The same aerials were used for both transmission and reception.
Aerial type 184 was a vertical half-wave with a director on a streamlined spar which spaced it off from the aircraft skin.
It covered 214 –234 Mc/s.
In both cases the aerials were located on opposite sides of the nose of the aircraft.
6.2 Lucero trials results Results of trials were reported by TRE in [ 3], using a Wellington aircraft with horizontal aerials (type 301).
It was noted that the horizontal aerials should havegiven the best results with the coastal beacons while the vertical antennas should have given best results with IFF Mk.
III and vertically polarised beacons, such as Eureka.
The main results of the trials are given in table 6.3.
It was noted that the ease of homing onto beacons was similar to ASV Mk II but that homing onto IFF Mk.
III was dif ﬁcult due to the short response, occurring only every 2 ½ s.
Unlocked interference from ASV Mk.
II could also cause problems.
Good results were also obtained on the ASV/BABS with horizontal aerials on the Wellington.
A range of 16 miles on the equi-signal path was observed at 2000 ft.
Using the vertical antennas the range was cut by a half on this beacon, which wasradiating a 15 μs pulse.
The minimum range was nominally about 7 –8μs after the end of the transmitter pre-pulse, allowing 2 to 3 μs for the receiver to recover after a Table 6.3.

This was equivalent to about 3/4 of a mile although it was reported that some response could often be observed at shorter ranges.
A CCDU trial of Lucero was undertaken in June 1943 to determine its opera- tional performance against a BABS beacon in a Wellington VIII [ 6].
Flying against a BABS beacon installed at Beaulieu by RAE Farnborough, maximum ranges of 16 nmi at 1000 ft, 20 nmi at 2000 ft and 22 nmi at 5000 ft were reported.
The ergonomics were considered dif ﬁcult.
The operator had to concentrate continuously on the height tube, while adjusting the range strobe to measure range.
However, theoverall conclusion was that the equipment performed well.

I, II and IIA, together with the centimetric ASV Mks III, IIIA, IIIB and IIIC and ASV Mk.
VI, VIA, VI B and VI C.
The centimetric radars in S-band were developments in the UK derivedfrom H 2S Mk.
II.
The X-band variant ASV Mk.
VII, derived from H 2S Mk.
III, also ﬂew as a prototype but was not developed further until after 1945.
The following sections describe the comparative performance of these radars.
7.2 ASV Mk.
II and III In March 1942, trials took place at Ballykelly, Northern Ireland, to determine therelative merits of ASV Mk.
IIA (the high power variant of ASV Mk.
II) and thenewly developed ASV Mk.
III [ 1].
A proposed radar design with a wavelength of 50 cm was also assessed.
The high power 1.5 m equipment was installed in a LRASV Mk.
II Wellington, with an experimental 100 kW transmitter, using NT.
99 valves and rotary spark gap modulation.
The receiver was the standard model for ASV Mk.
II.
A speciallydesigned switch was used to change the transmitter between homing and broadside aerials.
Two submarines were used as targets, at a distance of about 7 miles north of Lough Foyle.
Because of the proximity of land, only homing aerials were used.
Thereliable maximum ranges against a fully-surfaced submarine were 14 miles at 1500 ft, 11 miles at 1000 ft, and 7 miles at 500 ft.
Against a submarine trimmed down the ranges were 7 miles at 1500 ft, 6 miles at 1000 ft and 4 miles at 500 ft.
Minimumranges varied from 3 miles to 1 mile.
It was thought that an increase of about 20% in range might be achieved when the broadside arrays were used.
A prototype installation of ASV Mk.
III in a Wellington, referred to as a 10 cm ASV in the report, produced much more impressive ﬁgures.
For average weather conditions the most effective operational height appeared to vary from 500 to 800 ft, and up to 2000 ft when the sea was calm.
Large convoys could be detected at ranges doi:10.1088/978-1-6432-7066-1ch7 7-1 ªMorgan & Claypool Publishers 2018 of up to 40 miles from a height of 500 ft (i.e.
well beyond the radar horizon, which would have been about 27 nautical miles at 500 ft).
Other aircraft in ﬂight could be observed at a range of 10 miles and their approximate direction of ﬂight determined.
Reliable maximum ranges against a fully-surfaced submarine were 12 miles at 500 ft and 10 miles at 250 ft.
The 50 cm equipment was installed in an Anson with a 100 kW transmitter similar to that used in the 1.5 m radar.
Its results were disappointing and considerably below what had been predicted.
The maximum ranges against afully-surfaced submarine (beam-on) were 7 miles at 1200 ft, 4 miles at 500 ft, and 5 miles at 200 ft.
Following these trials it was con ﬁrmed that the 10 cm ASV radar was a de ﬁnite operational requirement, even though it was still only at prototype stage.
The 50 cm radar appeared to offer no detection range advantage over metric ASV.
However, its antennas offered far less drag and it may have been less susceptible to detection byGerman search receivers, at least in the short term.
For these reasons, development of a 50 cm ASV radar continued, together with the 10 cm equipment.
However, once the operational bene ﬁts and performance of the 10 cm radars were con ﬁrmed, it was decided that further development of metric A S V would be restricted to immediate requirements such as anti-jamming devices and slight modi ﬁcations to allow more efﬁcient receiver valves to be used.
Furthermore, development of 50 cm ASV was discontinued.
7.3 ASV Mks III, VI and VII The performance of the ASV Mk.
III and ASV Mk.
VI radars was documented in various trials undertaken by TRE and CCDU, as discussed in the earlier chapters.
CCDU also undertook a series of trials aimed at directly comparing the two radars[2].
Trials of ASV Mk.
VII [ 3] also made comparisons with these radars.
It is of interest to look at these comparative performance results and assess them in the light of modern radar modelling methods.
As previously discussed, the performance of these radars in operational use was hugely variable.
Variations in sensitivity of tens of dB between radars and over time were noted by TRE and CCDU [ 4,5].
This was due to the dif ﬁculty in correctly tuning and maintaining this new type of equipment, but also due to the very variable nature of the maritime environment, which always makes comparative performance assessments dif ﬁcult [ 6].
The radars also suffered from unreliable components, which often deteriorated over the course of a trial (especially the microwave mixer diodes [4,7]).
In order to establish a comparative assessment of the sensitivity of these radars in the air, the CCDU attempted to develop the use of the detection rangesagainst known targets.
On operational ﬂights the radars were assessed for service- ability soon after take-off against Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel, or the Isles of Scilly.
The latter were often more convenient when ﬂying from RAF Chivenor (situated on the north coast of Devon) to operations in the Bay of Biscay, as Lundy Island was too close.
For more formal CCDU analysis of sensitivity [ 2] with trials undertaken from RAF Angle (near Pembroke in south west Wales), GrassholmAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 7-2 Island was used.
This is a small uninhabited island situated 7 nmi off the west coast of Wales.
It is a bare rock with an area of about 10 ha, about 300 m by 300 m in extent and with a highest elevation of 42 m (138 ft).
Its radar response was similarfor all directions and its radar cross section (RCS) was suf ﬁciently large for radar returns not to be affected by local sea conditions.
The locations of many of these places are shown in chapter 4,ﬁgure 4.32.
The performance of radars was also routinely tested against surfaced submarine targets (viewed either broadside or stern-on) and radar training buoys.
The Chivenorbuoy was a 12 ton, 12 ft diameter buoy with a 6 ft diameter family of corner reﬂectors on top [ 3].
It appears to have had an RCS roughly equivalent to a surfaced submarine viewed broadside, possibly about 500 m 2(its apparent RCS would have ﬂuctuated considerably in the presence of multipath re ﬂections off the sea surface, giving potential increases in RCS up to +12 dB or deep fades).
In November 1944, CCDU was able to undertake a comparison of production versions of ASV Mk.
III and ASV Mk.
VI [ 2].
By this time many of the reliability and servicing problems had been improved, if not totally overcome.
In August 1944, a trial of a prototype ASV Mk.
VII was also undertaken by CCDU.
At this stage theradar was still quite unreliable but some general comparisons could be made with ASV Mk.
III and ASV Mk.
VI.
In the following sections, the reported comparisons of these radars are discussed and their performance is assessed in the light of modernradar modelling methods.
7.3.1 Comparative trials The best comparison of performance of ASV III and ASV Mk.
VI was reported in [2] and the assessment of a prototype ASV Mk.
VII was given in [ 3].
Radar trials are notoriously dif ﬁcult to undertake and even without equipment unreliability are prone to uncertainty in the weather sea conditions and targets.
In addition, all detection ranges reported are taken from operator observations.
The skills and attention spans of operators varied greatly and added to the uncertainty of theresults obtained.
The radar noise-limited sensitivity was routinely tested by CCDU against Grassholm Island, ﬂying at a height of 1000 ft.
Table 7.1shows the reported average detection rage, R, for the different radars.
Also shown is the implied detection sensitivity (proportional to R 4) relative to ASV Mk.
III.
CCDU took the average detection range against Grassholm over many trials and radars to normalise the results for individual trials, given actual range reported Table 7.1.

VII 35 (max) +5.9Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 7-3 against Grassholm on an individual trial.
The average normalised detection ranges against U-class submarines were also assessed and are shown in table 7.2.
The variation between beam aspect and end-on aspect detection ranges suggest avariation with aspect of radar cross-section (RCS) of 7 –10 dB.
Finally, average detection ranges against Lundy Island from the west and the Chivenor training buoy were reported, as shown in table 7.3.
It may be noted that the detection range against the Chivenor buoy for ASV Mk.
VII seems anomalously low, perhaps re ﬂecting the dif ﬁculties of such trials and the unreliability of the prototype radar.
The results for ASV Mks.
III and VI are compared graphically for different radar heights in ﬁgures 7.1and7.2.

Table 7.4shows the minimum (downwind) and maximum (upwind) extents of the clutter reported from the trials.
Again, thereresults were quite subjective but show a clear variation between upwind and downwind directions and the increase in sea return with aircraft height and sea roughness.
7.3.2 Predicted performance of ASV Mks III, VI and VII The key parameters that in ﬂuenced detection range performance are listed in table 7.5, using modern SI units.
Direct comparisons between ASV Mk.
III and ASV Mk.
VI are more straightforward as they both operated at the same frequency, with similar antennas and radar waveforms.
In respect of detection performance,ASV Mk.
VI principally differed from ASV Mk.
III by having a much higher power (200 kW compared with 40 kW) representing an increase in sensitivity of 5 dB.

ASV Mk.
VIA and VIB also had a variable scan rate and CCDU recommended using 30 rpm, rather than the ﬁxed value of 60 rpm used on ASV Mk.
III.
This would also have improved the noise- limited detection by increasing the pulse- to-pulse integration on the display.
The elevation beam pattern of ASV Mk.
VI was also improved (see ﬁgure 7.3).
Operating at 1000 ft, this would not have af fected performance at ranges greater than 1 nmi but it would have had an effect on the gain control required whenhoming in on a target at short range.
The secondary lobe at a depression angle of 25°on the ASV Mk.

VI pattern.
A good approach to designing the elevation pattern is to use a cosec2shape, starting from about the −3 dB gain point in the downward direction (positiv e depression).
This provides a constant noise-limited detection sensitivity agains t a given target radar cross section (RCS) independent of range.
Figure 7.3shows the original Mk.
III and Mk.
VI patterns with a cosec2pattern also shown.
It can be seen that the Mk.
VI pattern was much closer to the desired shape.
ASV Mk.
VII would have used a similar antenna aperture, although the elevation beam pattern is not known.
The change in wavelength from 9.1 cm to 3.2 cm would have reduced the azimuth and elevation beamwidths.
This would have increased theantenna gain and also reduced the size of the clutter patch illuminated by a pulse.
The pulse length and pulse repletion frequency seem to have been unchanged from ASV Mk.
VI.
ASV Mk.
VII also had a variable scan rate.
A rate of 30 rpm wouldhave allowed 12 pulses to be integrated during a beam dwell.
The receiver noise ﬁgure and microwave losses are unknown but may well have been relatively poor in the early prototype systems.
An important bene ﬁt of operating in X-band in ASV Mk.
VII would have been the improved ability to resolve targets closely spaced in azimuth and the improved bearing accuracy when identifying land features or homing onto a target.
The losses in the microwave feeders and the mixer crystal are not known and rough estimates have been made here for the purposes of performance comparison.
Typical overall noise ﬁgures of crystal mixers followed by an IF ampli ﬁer are given in [8] and ranged from 11 dB to 16 dB at 3060 MHz input frequency.
The US mixer crystals (silicon diodes) referenced in [ 8] (IN23 and IN23A, B and C) are thought to be similar to the CV101 diodes used in the UK.
The values used in table 7.5may be a bit low but are satisfactory for purposes of comparisons.
7.3.2.1 The radar range equation The received power levels from the target and sea clutter, together with the thermal noise level, can be assessed using the radar range equations, the parameters in table 7.5and models for the clutter re ﬂectivity [ 6].
The power received, P r, from a target at range Rwith radar cross section (RCS) σ, is given by: πσ πλ π= μPPG RRG LL 44 41(7.1)t r222 a where μLis the microwave loss and Lais the atmospheric loss, given for a radar frequency fHz by =×−L f 1.54 10 a80 .

In general σ0varies with wind speed (sea state), grazing angle, ϕ, and radar frequency, f, increasing in value with sea state and grazing angle.
A well-known model for re ﬂectivity is the GIT model [ 9] and values for σ0at S and X bands and for sea states 1 –4, looking up-wind, with horizontal antenna polarisation are given in ﬁgure 7.4.
Maritime radar performance is often de ﬁned in relation to the sea state, which de ﬁnes the heights of the waves and is related to the wind speed for a fully developed sea.
Table 7.6gives the de ﬁnition for the Douglas sea states, usually used in radar.
Much more discussion can be found in [ 6].
The minimum detectable signal is determined by the received signal, clutter and noise levels associated with a given target position in the radar beam, combined with Figure 7.4.

For these radars, the processing was essentially the non-coherent integration of Npulses through the action of the long-persistence phosphor in the radar PPI displays.
The standard analysis of the detectionperformance following integration assumes idealised processing, including matched ﬁltering, and actual non-ideal processing is accounted for through the addition of a signal processing loss.
This will include a loss because the IF bandwidth of 3.5 MHz is wider than the ideal matched bandwidth of 1 MHz for a 1 μs pulse length.
Here a signal processing loss of 8.5 dB has been included.
The actual determination ofdetection performance following non-coherent integration is done using statistical analysis methods [ 6] but as a rough guide, the improvement in sensitivity against thermal noise following the non-coherent integration of Npulses is approximately a factor N.
However, if the clutter returns are dominant, pulse-to-pulse integration will have little effect on detection performance, because unlike thermal noise the clutter does not decorrelate from pulse-to-pulse but remains almost constant over abeam dwell.
The amplitude statistics of the clutter are also likely to be different from thermal noise but for these radars with low spatial resolution the amplitude distribution of clutter would have been similar to that of noise.
7.3.2.2 Modelling results With these modelling methods available, as explained in more detail in [ 6], we can now model the performance of these radars and compare the results of modelling with trials.
A simple comparison of noise-limited detection can be made by considering a ﬁgure of merit based on the ratio of values of PNp/ r n, taken from (7.1) and ( 7.2).
Using the values in table 7.1and taking the performance of ASV Mk.
III as the reference, the noise-limited performances of ASV Mk.
VI and ASV Mk.
VII would have been 10.5 dB and 8 dB greater, respectively.
This would have been equivalent to an increase in noise-limited detection ranges by factors of 1.8 and 1.6times, respectively.
Relative clutter-limited performance would have been deter- mined from the relative signal-to-clutter ratios, derived from ( 7.3).
For these radars, the main variables would have been the azimuth beamwidth, θ°az, and the clutter reﬂectivity, σ0.
As shown in ﬁgure 7.4,r eﬂectivity is a function of radar frequency, grazing angle and sea state.
The clutter-limited detection sensitivities for ASV Mk.
III and ASV Mk.
VI would have been the same.
The performance of ASV Mk.
VIIwould have been worse, due to increased clutter returns despite the reduced azimuth beamwidth, due to increased clutter re ﬂectivity at X-band.
At a range of 10 nmi, the clutter-limited performance would have been worse by 10.6 dB, 12 dB, 7.7 dB,3.7 dB and 3.2 dB, in sea states 1 –5, respectively.
A conventional method of modelling performance is to assume that the radar is able to control false alarms at a constant level at all ranges.
Modern radars achievethis with advanced signal processing but on these early radars the false alarm rate for clutter and noise could only be controlled with the radar gain control and the display brightness.
In practice the operator would adjust the gain and brightness to achievean acceptably low false alarm rate at long range in noise.
At shorter range, the clutter levels would usually be very high.
The sea return discriminator described in chapter 3(section 3.3.2) could be used to reduce the clutter intensity and prevent theAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 7-9 display saturating.
If the radar was homing onto a target, the receiver gain would be steadily reduced to control the clutter levels.
Figure 7.5shows idealised curves of the minimum detectable radar cross-section as a function of range for Pd=0.5 in different sea states with the radar at 1000 ft and 2000 ft for ASV Mk.
III.
Figure 7.6 shows the equivalent results with the radar at 1000 ft for ASV Mk.
VI and ASV Mk.
VII.
The targets were modelled as Swerling Case 1 (a slow fading target with a radar cross-section having an exponential distribution) and a nominal probability of false alarm at the display of 10−4was assumed.
If the minimum size of a focussed spot on the PPI was 0.5 mm, then this would achieve about 10 false alarms per scan on a 5 inch diameter PPI.
It may be noted that detection performance is not very sensitive to false alarm rate and a reduction in Pfato, say, 10−5would reduce sensitivity by about 0.8 dB following 18 pulses integrated.
The curves in the ﬁgures here model the statistics of the clutter and noise and the effects of pulse-to-pulse integration more accurately than the simple ﬁgures of merit discussed above.
They can be used to compare the noise-limited performance of the three radars.
Referring to table 7.1, ASV Mk.
III could detect Grassholm Island at 23.5 nmi.
The modelled results in ﬁgure 7.5suggest that Grassholm Island may have had an RCS of about 30 dB m2 (32 dB m2from ﬁgure 7.5).
Referring to ﬁgure 7.6, this suggests that ASV Mk.
VI might be expected to detect Grassholm Island at 40 nmi and ASV Mk.
VII is Figure 7.5.

III, 1000 ft; (b) ASV Mk.
III, 2000 ft.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 7-10 predicted at 37 nm.
These ﬁgures suggest relative sensitivities of +9.2 dB and +7.9 dB (compared with the rough ﬁgure of merit values of 10.5 dB and 8 dB).
The actual values from trials in table 7.1are slightly lower, representing increases in noise-limited sensitivities of +8.6 dB and +5.9 dB, compared to ASV Mk.
III.
Given the dif ﬁculty of measuring performance in trials and uncertainty over the actual radar parameter values, the modelled results appear to be quite representative ofperformance reported in trials.
The results in ﬁgures 7.5and7.6also illustrate the impact of sea conditions on target detection.
In all cases, small targets (e.g.
RCS of 10 dBm 2) would have been invisible at all ranges except in very low sea states.
It is also interesting to note in ﬁgure 7.5the behaviour in sea state 2 at short range.
Looking upwind, at target of 15 dB m2RCs is detectable from about 9 nmi range down to about 5 nmi range, but then is not detectable until a range of about 1 nmi.
This type of behaviour may explain the observations by the operator in early trials [ 5] (see chapter 3) that sometimes the target would disappear over an interval from 4 or 5 miles range down to about 2 miles range, before reappearing again.
The curves in these ﬁgures also give an indication of the range extent of sea returns.
Another way of assessing these is to model a ﬁxed detection threshold, equivalent to a ﬁxed radar gain setting.
The probability of false alarm of clutter- Figure 7.6.

VII, 1000 ft; solid lines upwind; dashed line downwind.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 7-11 plus-noise can be plotted as a function of range.
Figure 7.7shows the false alarm rate for the three radars as a function of range in sea state 3, for both upwind and downwind directions.
The gain is set to give a Pfaof 10−4at long range, where the performance is noise-limited.
Once the false alarm rate exceeds, say, 10−2the display would be saturated with alarms.
The extent of sea returns modelled in this way can be compared with those in table 7.4.
The modelled variation across the upwind and downwind directions is not as extreme as those in the table.
However, the expected extent of the sea returns is clearly comparable and the dependence on wind directionis also evident.
It may also be noted that the clutter extent in ASV Mk.
VII is expected to be greater than for ASV Mk.
VI, although this was not observed in the trials results.
The reported detection ranges against submarines in table 7.2are also consistent with the modelled noise-limited detection results.
If a broadside submarine is assumed to have an RCS of 30 dB m 2, then the modelled detection ranges would be 21 nmi for ASV Mk.
III and about 40 nmi for ASV Mk.
VI.
The values in table 7.2are 22 nmi and 32 nmi which are quite consistent, given the uncertainties of the trial conditions and radar sensitivities.
The measured detection range for ASV Mk.VII was worse than that for ASV Mk.
VI but this is not expected and likely to re ﬂect the poor performance of the prototype radar.

Coastal Command also ﬂew on long-range American aircraft made available under the Lend –Lease programme.
By the end of WWII Coastal Command had under its control six squadrons of Leigh Light Liberators, one squadron of VLR (very long-range) Liberators, together with six squadrons of USNLiberators and one Czech squadron of Liberators.
There were also four squadrons of Catalinas.
The VLR Liberator in particular played a very important role in the Battle of the Atlantic, being able to prosecute the ﬁght against U-boats at ranges beyond the capabilities of other Coastal Command aircraft.
ASV Mk.
II was produced in the USA as well as the UK.
In the USA it was known as ASE for the USN and SCR-521 for the Signal Corps and wasmanufactured by Philco and REL (in Toronto, Canada).
These radars were essentially copies of ASV Mk.
II, except for changes to US types of ‘tubes ’[2] and were mainly ﬁtted to USN PBY Catalinas.
With the advent of centimetric radars, the policy in the UK was mainly to use British ASV in British aircraft and only use American centimetric ASV in US aircraft.
Development of 10 cm ASV was undertaken separately in the twocountries.
However, early work in the USA, starting in 1941, was the result of a close collaboration with British scientists working at the Radiation Laboratory.
It was decided to concentrate on a design for the Liberator aircraft, which ﬁtted Coastal Command requirements for a long-range aircraft, although it was not certain at that time whether the Air Ministry would release Liberators for that role.
In late 1941, the Radiation Laboratory had started the design of a set called DMS.1000, which closely met the requirements of Coastal Command (see chapter 3).
In December 1941, at the same time as work on the experimental installation of ASV Mk.
III on a Wellington was completed by TRE, testing of the ﬁrst installation doi:10.1088/978-1-6432-7066-1ch8 8-1 ªMorgan & Claypool Publishers 2018 of DMS.1000 in Liberator AL.507 was started.
This Liberator arrived in the UK for trials in April and May 1942, when it performed well.
Meanwhile, in the UK the Air Ministry had decided that centimetric ASV should be installed in Fortresses, not Lib erators.
The Fortresses had been found unsuitable for operation by Bomber Command and so were released to Coastal Command.
However, in common with the Wellington, Sunderland and Whitley already in service they were not long-range aircraft in the context of the Battle of the Atlantic.
Then, despite the inter est in DMS.1000 the United States War Department cancelled the productio n order in favour of SCR.517B, which had been selected as the standard equipment for the United States Army Air Corps.
SCR.517B, which had been developed by Wes tern Electric, was well-engineered but was much less sensitive than DMS.1000 and generally more cumbersome and was less advanced technologically [ 1].
At the same time, the company Philco had been developing a radar designated ASG for use in ‘blimps ’.
This radar was much closer in characteristics to DMS.1000 and the British were able to place an order for 500 sets of ASG for installation in aircraft, to be designated ASG.1.
The earlier order for SCR.517B was retaine d as an insurance against the failure of ASG.1.
8.1.1.1 ASV Mk.
V In a further change of policy in the UK, in view of the urgent requirement for long- range aircraft, it was decided to allocate Liberators to Coastal Command.
In 1942, 30 Liberator GR Mk.
V were received.
Of these aircraft, seven were equipped withmodel-shop versions of DMS.1000, two with SCR.517B and 20 with ASG.1.
The USA also then decided to standardise on ASG.1, which was the better radar, and this was designated as ASV Mk.
V for use in aircraft of Coastal Command.
A laterversion with higher power, ASG.3 or AN/APS-2 in the USA, was designated ASV Mk.
VA.
8.1.1.2 ASV Mk.
X During 1943, concern was growing over the likely development by the Germans of a warning receiver for the 10 cm band.
It was agreed that a 3 cm ASV systemshould be considered.
In the UK this resulted in plans for ASV Mk.
VII, as discussed in chapter 5.
At the same time, a 3 cm version of ASG, AN/APS-15, was being developed in the USA.
This radar was designed as an X-band H 2Sa n d was considered unnecessarily complic ated for ASV use.
It was agreed that 100 Liberator GR Mk.
V ﬁtted with AN/APS-15 would be made available to Coastal Command starting in December 1943.
The Coastal Command version ofAN/APS-15 became known as ASV Mk.
X.
It was a complicated installation, including alternative antennas for high or low level operation and including manually operated tilt adjustment [ 1].
ASV Mk.
X had a peak power of about 40 kW, with pulse lengths of 0.5, 1 or 2 μs and corresponding PRFs of 1010, 650 or 300 c/s, according to the selected range scale [ 3].
The 2 μs pulse length was mainly used for beacon interrogation.
Th e antenna had an azimuth beamwidth of about 3 °.Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 8-2 8.1.1.3 ASV Mk.
VIII At the same time as the development of ASV Mk.
X, the 3 cm AN/APS-3 was alsomade available.
This was a forward-looking ASV and was mainly ﬁtted to Catalinas of Coastal Command as ASV Mk.
VIIIA, ﬁrst entering service in June 1944.
ASV Mk.
VIIIA had a peak power of about 40 kW, with pulse lengths of 0.5, 1 or 2 μs and corresponding PRFs of 1400, 700 or 360 c/s, according to the selected range scale [ 3].
The 2 μs pulse length was mainly used for beacon interrogation.
The antenna had a pencil beam with a beamwidth of about 5 °.
8.1.1.4 ASV serviceability The USA radar sets were generally better engineered and more reliable than theBritish sets.
A survey carried out during January, February and March 1945 showed that ASV Mks.
V and X were signi ﬁcantly more reliable than the various ASV Mks.
III and VI.
Table 8.1shows the comparison between the different centimetric systems in use with Coastal Command for long range surveillance at that time.
8.1.2 ASV for Coastal Command strike aircraft and FAA Smaller 3 cm ASV systems were also developed in the UK, for use in Coastal Command strike aircraft and the Fleet Air Arm (FAA).
These ASV systemsincluded the following: ASV Mk.

X 297.5 33.1Airborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 8-3 range of land-based aircraft, it was clear that there was a need for carrier-borne air cover for long-range spotting of U-boats.
Due to the limited scanner size that could be used on smaller carrier-based aircraft there was a need to develop X-bandsystems, in order to achieve adequate angular resolution.
Development of what was initially known as ASVX started in late 1941.
This was intended for use on the Barracuda aircraft, which was being planned as a replacement torpedo-bomber – reconnaissance aircraft for the Sword ﬁsh.
With the immediate need for carrier-borne air cover and with the Barracuda not yet in production, an ASV installation wasplanned for the Sword ﬁsh, for use on small escort carriers.
The ASV for the Sword ﬁsh was known as ASV Mk.
XI.
Initial progress was slow but a pre- production system was ﬁrst installed on a Sword ﬁsh in February 1943 [ 3].
The radar scanner was installed between the ﬁxed undercarriage struts of the Sword ﬁsh, providing a forward-looking sector scan.
It was established in trials that the radar could reliably search for a small submarine with decks awash by sweeping a lane 14miles wide.
By November 1943 the ﬁrst operational squadron was ready to embark and by September 1944 about 200 Sword ﬁsh Mk.
III had been ﬁtted with ASV Mk.
XI.
ASV Mk.
XIII was developed from ASV Mk.
XI and is described in more detail in [4].
It had a peak transmitter power in X-band of about 50 kW, with pulse lengths of 0.5μs at a PRF of 1200 c/s, 1 μs at 1200 or 600 c/s and 2.25 μs at 350 c/s.
Range scales of 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 miles were provided, with automatic selection of pulse length and PRF.
The radar included strobe unit type 67, for accurate ranging on targets, and Lucero TR 3505 (see chapter 6andﬁgure 6.2).
It could also interrogate centimetric beacons.
ASV Mk.
XIIIA was intended for all-round search, using scanner type 75 (re ﬂector size 18 ″×12″) which was unstabilised.
ASV Mk.
XIIIB was intended for forward search, using scanner type 80 (re ﬂector size 24 ″×16″) which was stabilised against aircraft roll.
In 1945 it was intended that ASV Mk.
XIIIC and Mk.
XIIID would be developed for the Sunderland and Warwick, respectively, using the scanner type 85 (re ﬂector size 36 ″×27″) which was to be stabilised against aircraft pitch and roll.
These developments did not take place but ASV Mk.
XIIID would be further developed after the war for use as ASV 13 in the Avro Shackleton MR aircraft, which entered service in 1951.
8.2 The schnorkel The ASV installations in operation at the end of the war were only generallyeffective against surfaced U-boats.
Detection of schnorkel tubes was only possible at short ranges in calm seas.
Against surfaced U-boats performance was considered good and ASV could be used to search large areas.
However, even in good conditions search performance against schnorkels was low.
The problem was that of discriminating the small radar return from the schnorkel with the returns from the surrounding sea.
This would notbe adequately addressed until well after WWII, and needed, amongst other things, high power 3 cm ASV systems with large antenna apertures and short pulse lengths.
Techniques investigated on ASV Mk.
X during WWII included the use of a shortAirborne Maritime Surveillance Radar, Volume 1 8-4 time constant video ﬁlter (the clutter ﬁlter discussed in chapters 3and4), instanta- neous automatic gain control, swept gain and offset expanded sector scan.
For fully submerged submarines, the use of sonobuoys was only just starting to be developed [ 1,6] and some limited success had also been achieved with magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD) [ 1].
8.3 Coastal Command at the end of WWII On 1 April 1945, the Coastal Command battle line comprised 40 RAF squadrons, two FAA, one SAAF and six USN, representing a total establishment of 765aircraft, of which 481 were available for operations [ 5].
A further four squadrons were used for photo-reconnaissance, six for air/sea rescue and six for meteorological operations, representing a further establishment of 297 aircraft, of which 112 wereavailable for operations.
The deployment of different ASV systems in Coastal Command reconnaissance aircraft at the end of WWII was as follows [ 1]: ASV Mk.

During WWII losses of Coastal-Command-controlled aircraft [ 5] were 741 on anti-U-boat operations, 885 on anti-shipping operations and 443 on other oper- ations, resulting in total losses of 2069 aircraft.
A total of 5863 aircrew were killed inbattle and a further 2261 in ﬂying accidents.
By overcoming the U-boat threat the aircraft and crews of Coastal Command had made a decisive contribution to the outcome of the war and the supportingtechnology, including ASV radar as described in this book, played a very signi ﬁcant part.
