<BOS> The  two-beam antennas also utilize some high-angle gain enhancement to counter the  high-angle effects of STC. <EOS>

<BOS> This error could lead to significant tactical consequences in a ship’s  self-defense scenario. <EOS>
<BOS> The effect of a filter response on range or time sidelobes  can be seen by taking the filter impulse response h(t) and adding to this a delayed  impulse response 20log10(a) dB below the main response to produce the modified  response h'(t), which is given by  h'(t) = h(t) + a h(t−T0) (6.18) Using the property of time shifting of the Fourier transform, the resultant frequency  response is given by  ′ = +−H H e Hj T( ) ( ) ( ) w w a ww0  (6.19) Thus, for small values of a, the resulting magnitude and phase response is that of the  original filter modified by a sinusoidal phase and amplitude modulation as given here:  | ( ) || ( ) |( c os( ) ) ′ = + H H T w w w 10 α  (6.20)  ∠′ = ∠ − H H T ( ) ( ) sin( ) w w a w0 (6.21) Therefore, if there are n ripples across the filter bandwidth B, the range sidelobe  occurs at time T0 given by  T0 = n/B (6.22) Assuming a compressed pulse width of 1/B, values of n < 1 will put the range  sidelobe within the main lobe of the target return, resulting in a distortion of the  mainlobe response. <EOS>

<BOS> The requirement for  low sidelobes for clutter rejection in the AWACS radar resulted in technology that now  supports sidelobe levels of more than 50 dB below the main-beam peak.62,63 The price  that must be paid to achieve these low sidelobes includes (1) a reduction in gain, (2) an  increase in beamwidth, (3) increased tolerance control, (4) increased cost, and (5) the  need to operate in an environment free from obstructions that can readily increase the  sidelobes.64 In spite of these drawbacks, the trend to low-sidelobe antennas has accel - erated since low sidelobes provide a counter to electronic countermeasures (ECM). <EOS>

<BOS> For surface clutter, as viewed by a surface-based radar,  σ στσ = ⋅ = ⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ A Rc c0 0 2qaz  (2.17) where σ is the average radar cross section, in square meters; Ac is the area of clutter  illuminated, in square meters; R is the range to clutter, in meters; qaz is the one-way  half-power azimuthal beamwidth, in radians; c is the speed of propagation, 300 million  m/s; t  is the half-power radar pulse length (after the matched filter), in seconds; and s 0  is the average clutter reflectivity factor, in square meters per square meter. <EOS>
<BOS> The corresponding linear crossrange  resolution at range R is then  δλ cr≈R D  (real aperture) (17.1) For example, if l = 3 cm (X band) and D = 2 m, qB ≈ 0.015 radians. <EOS>

<BOS> A technique called on-axis tracking was developed to minimize  radar axis deviation from the target by prediction and optimum filtering within the  tracking loop.8,31 The technique is particularly effective when the target trajectory is  known approximately, such as when tracking satellites in orbit or a ballistic target. <EOS>

<BOS> However, not only does the A/D converter have to sample the  RF directly, but unless it is preceded by tunable RF preselector filters, the A/D  converter input must have the dynamic range to handle all of the signals pres - ent in the radar band simultaneously. <EOS>
<BOS> This effect produces a summed signal at the radar antenna that is a function of both the  target height and the radar antenna height above the sea, as these affect the path length  difference of the direct and reflected radiation. <EOS>

<BOS> Nevertheless, the  cross section predictions at the lower grazing angles for both polarizations show trends  similar to the predictions of the Bragg or composite-surface models.93 One major problem with all models based on scattering feature simulations is the  lack of reliable information about the shapes, sizes, orientations, speeds, lifetimes  and statistics of the features themselves. <EOS>

Some of the typical monopulse feeds are described to show the basic relations and  tradeoffs involved in the various performance factors and how the more important  factors can be optimized by a feed configuration but at the price of lower performance  in other areas.4 Many new techniques have been added since the original four-horn  square feed in order to provide good or excellent performance in all desired feed char - acteristics in a well-designed monopulse radar. <EOS>

<BOS> the development of HF skywave radar can be traced back to the 1920s,  when skywave echoes were identified,1 but the first HF radar systems were not deployed  until the 1950s.2 Since then, skywave radar has evolved to address applications such  as the detection and tracking of aircraft, ballistic and cruise missiles, and ships.3–15 In  addition to detecting “skin” echoes from targets of interest, HF radar is useful for observ - ing various forms of high-altitude atmospheric ionization, both natural, including those  associated with aurorae and meteors, and artificial, including the interaction of space - craft and ballistic missiles with the ionospheric plasma.16–19 Further, the wavelengths  used are of the same order as ocean surface gravity waves, and this correspondence can  be exploited to provide information on the wave directional spectrum, ocean currents,  and, by inference, surface winds.5 Indeed, scattering from the sea can often be employed  as a radar cross section (RCS) amplitude reference and is a widely used diagnostic tool. <EOS>

<BOS> In spite of it requiring no modulator, dc operation has  seldom been used because of its many limitations.30 Crossed-field amplifiers have been used in radars in the past, but they have signifi - cant disadvantages, as was described in the second edition of this Radar Handbook,   that make it less likely they will be widely used in the future. <EOS>

<BOS> Technology advanced  and led to a series of operational systems in the 1980s; many publications became  available.4–15 In terms of performance improvement, ultralow sidelobes (less than  −40 dB) were demonstrated first in the 1970s by Westinghouse Electric Corporation’s  AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) and brought about tight tolerances in  construction and phase settings. <EOS>

<BOS> A compelling example is presented in Figure 20.42, where a range cell containing a  ship target traveling at a speed of 13 knots has been interrogated at eight radar frequen - cies and the resulting doppler spectra plotted in a nested display . <EOS>
<BOS> For example, a sampling increment of  t = 100 ps is added to the previous pulse repetition sampling interval to enable sam - pling of the received signal at regular intervals as indicated in Figure 21.16. <EOS>
<BOS> For many  reasons, this is not wholly satisfactory, so various alternatives have been explored,  including packaged “recipes” that can be invoked by less skilled operators and expert  systems implemented with artificial intelligence constructs. <EOS>

<BOS> Jamming sources may be located on the target platform itself (self-screening)  and received by the main antenna beam or radiate from a separate location (stand-off)  and be received mainly through the antenna beampattern sidelobes. <EOS>
<BOS> Such a high fractional bandwidth (an ultra-wideband SAR ) presents challenges  in designing hardware components, such as antennas, that are reasonably linear over the  full frequency range.57 Furthermore, the long aperture time presents motion-compensa - tion challenges, and the wide real-beam angle adds to processing difficulties, very likely  requiring Range-Migration Algorithm (RMA) processing (Section 17.3). <EOS>

<BOS> Linearity over this range should be 0.5 dB or better, and  if not, steps should be taken to correct measured data via calibration of the receiver  transfer function (gain characteristics). <EOS>

<BOS> Linear-FM (LFM) is a common waveform used in  operational high-power radars, because (1) each pulse contains the full bandwidth,  thereby enabling the full bandwidth to be transmitted and received much more  quickly than with step-frequency—a great advantage when the radar is moving,  such as for SAR—and (2) the hardware is relatively inexpensive and mature. <EOS>

<BOS> As with skywave radar, performance depends strongly on environmental and  target parameters, as well as radar design; the detection ranges cited in Table 20.3  provide some indication of capability against surface vessels and low-flying aircraft,  as claimed or reported for several established HFSWR systems. <EOS>

<BOS> Coherent  doppler processors are also generally vulnerable to impulsive radio frequency interfer - ence, especially in radars with a limited number of coherent bursts on target.147 Another ECCM technique to be considered is pulse compression by matched  filtering; it is intimately related to the waveform coding discussed in Section 24.7. <EOS>

<BOS> If a radar systems designer could ask for  anything he or she wanted in a radar transmitter, that wish might be something like  the following: Provide the necessary transmitted energy with the needed average and peak  power, as well as the required stability and low noise for good doppler process - ing; operate with high efficiency; have wide bandwidth and be easily tunable;  be readily modulated in amplitude, frequency, or phase as necessary; have high  reliability and long life; require minimum maintenance; have no dangerous X-ray  emissions; require no personnel to operate; be of an affordable price; and be of  reasonable size and weight for the desired application. <EOS>
<BOS> First, it has not always been clear which environmental parameters are impor - tant. <EOS>
