<BOS> If it is necessary to utilize  precisely the same waveform and RF pulse length from CPI to CPI, with, for example,  a klystron transmitter, the beam pulse of the klystron can be varied to maintain con - stant beam duty cycle while the RF pulse length is maintained constant. <EOS>

<BOS> The goal  is to preserve the desired signal while simultaneously reducing unwanted interference. <EOS>
<BOS> In surface scattering, particularly for the continuous sea surface, the  method of choice appears to be some variant of the Method of Moments.117 An exact  integral equation for the surface currents  excited by an illuminating field is solved  numerically over a grid of points, where the flexibility and accuracy of the solution  depends, essentially, on the grid spacing, the size of the surface features compared to  the illuminating wavelength, the extent of the surface over which the grid is laid, and  the efficiency of the computing algorithms used in what are extensive calculations. <EOS>
<BOS> Shorter wavelengths result in improved signal-to-clutter ratios owing  to the fact that the Rayleigh scattered weather signal power is inversely proportional  to l4, whereas the ground clutter return is only weakly dependent on wavelength. <EOS>

<BOS> For wavelengths of incident  radiation well in excess of 0.5 cm, the attenuation depends primarily on the liquid- water content and is independent of the drop-size distribution. <EOS>
<BOS> The minimum range is chosen  to exclude signals whose average frequency differs substantially from the frequency  in the region of interest. <EOS>
<BOS> There are no formal  standards governing instrumentation and measurement methods, but informal stan - dards of good measurement practice have been recognized for decades. <EOS>
<BOS> Such batch-mode operation is also required if a combination of MTI operation  and frequency agility is desired. <EOS>
<BOS> Printed technology is not generally used  for shipborne antennas; slotted waveguide arrays remain the cost-effective solution  for larger arrays, particularly as the higher power creates additional complications for  printed power dividers. <EOS>

<BOS> APPENDIX THE EARLY DAYS OF CMR The use of commercial marine radar arose directly from the rapid development of  radar technology for military applications during World War II. <EOS>
<BOS> For example, clock jitter results in errors in the sampled output of an ADC, as shown  in Figure 25.19. <EOS>
<BOS> 29. <EOS>
<BOS> For areas with surface temperatures between 10° and 30° Celsius and relative  humidities above 60% (i.e., the western Mediterranean, Red Sea, Indonesian Southwest  Pacific), surface-based subrefractive layers may develop during the night and early  morning hours. <EOS>
<BOS> *  In the field of oceanography, mesoscale features have scales of several hundred kilometers, as opposed to the much  larger basin scale (the North Atlantic ocean, for example). <EOS>
<BOS> J. <EOS>
<BOS> If polarization diversity is required or if an array is required to transmit one polar - ization and receive the orthogonal or both polarizations, either crossed dipoles or  circular or square radiators seem suitable. <EOS>
<BOS> The inability to predict reliably even  a day in advance is a serious consideration in radar design and scheduling. <EOS>
<BOS> More  details of the relationship between A/D converter and receiver SNR are included in  Sections 6.10 and 6.11. <EOS>
<BOS> As shown  in Figure 17.1 a, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)—typically a fast-Fourier trans - form (FFT)27—is applied to this set of N complex samples of frequency-domain data,  resulting in a set of N complex numbers in the time-domain corresponding to echoes  (magnitude and phase) that would be returned from a very short pulse of width ≈ 1/B,  sampled at time intervals ∆t = 1/B. <EOS>

<BOS> 24.4 ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES The objectives of an ECM system are to deny information (detection, position, track  initiation, track update, and classification of one or more targets) that the radar seeks  or to surround desired radar echoes with so many false targets that the true information  cannot be extracted.3–7 ECM tactics and techniques may be classified in a number of ways, i.e., by main  purpose, whether active or passive, by deployment, by platform, by victim radar, or  by a combination of these.13–16,20 An encyclopedia of ECM tactics and techniques can  be found in the literature.3,13 Here description is limited to the most common types  of ECM. <EOS>
<BOS> As will be described  in Section 6.10, too little noise relative to the quantization increment of the A/D con - verter causes a loss in sensitivity. <EOS>

<BOS> Tunable bandwidth offers the ability to change (tune) the radar signal frequency  over a wide range of the available spectrum. <EOS>
<BOS> A  change in frequency will change the location of the nulls and lobes so that by operating  over a wide frequency range, the nulls in elevation can be filled in, and the radar will  be less likely to lose a target echo signal. <EOS>
<BOS> This is accomplished by providing circuitry that changes the tuning word from sample  to sample in order to provide the desired frequency (or phase) modulation. <EOS>

<BOS> The theory of scattering from breaking waves referenced in connection with  Figure 15.20 was originally motivated by an attempt to explain the complex  behavior of sea spikes at low grazing angles observed by Lewis and Olin.40 This  theory was based on the plume model  of the most common spilling  breaker, in  which a water plume is emitted at the spilling crest and moves down the front  face;110 the scattering behavior was supplied by multipath illumination involving  reflections from the face of the wave.57 The elaboration of this model explained  much of the complex behavior of the observed sea spikes; however, like all other  models based on scattering features, it was necessary to make assumptions about  the sizes, shapes, and lifetimes of the scattering plumes. <EOS>

<BOS> Further, the Earth’s lower atmosphere  is coupled to the ionosphere by a variety of upward-propagating wave and radiation  processes, whereas the Earth’s magnetosphere, the region beyond the ionosphere where  the solar wind interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field, is the source or conduit for  corresponding perturbations from above. <EOS>

<BOS> Such a radar is less susceptible to a DRFM repeater because  (i) the jammer cannot adapt easily since the radar signal is varying in the PRI  domain, and (ii) the signal transmitted by a DRFM repeater jammer at a given  PRI (i.e., the radar signal that is used by the SAR at the previous PRI) is approxi - mately orthogonal to the radar signal that the SAR is utilizing at the current PRI,  and thus, a matched filtering with the current PRI radar signal would weaken the  DRFM repeater jammer signal. <EOS>

<BOS> Besides causing errors in estimated  target range and bearing, the tilted ionospheric “reflecting surface” near the equator  can support scattering of incident radiowaves into low-loss elevated trans-equatorial  modes (chordal modes) that return strong clutter from the opposite hemisphere, often  with highly unstable phase characteristics. <EOS>
<BOS> Another technique is to automatically scale the outputs of each stage by a factor of  0.5, which would not allow the outputs to grow. <EOS>
<BOS> We see  that the spikes appear at the points of maximum surface curvature, although the large  signal peak is probably a specular reflection from the initial breaking front. <EOS>
<BOS> It is argued that active arrays set the  stage for “graceful failure” since the loss of a few T/R elements would have little effect  on the net performance of the system. <EOS>

<BOS> It follows that the space-based environment offers an  attractive alternative: repeat-pass interferometry, originally suggested by Goldstein.46  If the pass-to-pass observations are separated in the vertical plane, then interferom - etry leads to relative terrain height estimation.47 If two observations have a time  delay corresponding to the repeat period of the orbit (typically 10 to 45 days), then  sub-wavelength movements (in the line-of-sight direction of the radar) may be mea - sured.48 The technique can be extended to multiple passes with proportionate increase  in the temporal baseline, leading to quite remarkable results. <EOS>

<BOS> In 1956, however, Crombie observed that at  high-frequency (HF) wavelengths (tens of meters) scattering appeared to arise from  a resonant interaction with sea waves of one-half of the incident wavelength, i.e., to  be of the Bragg type.5 Reinforced by the theoretical implications of various small  waveheight approximations and wave-tank measurements under idealized condi - tions, the Bragg model  was introduced into the microwave regime by many workers  in the mid-1960s.6–8 This produced a revolution in thinking about the origins of  sea clutter because it involved the sea wave spectrum , thus forging a link between  clutter physics and oceanography in what became the field of radio oceanography . <EOS>

<BOS> The gyrotron bunching  operation also can be obtained at harmonics of the cyclotron frequency, but there can  be problems with higher circuit losses and competition with modes operating at lower  harmonics so that most high-power gyrotrons operate at the fundamental frequency or  its second harmonic.33 Because the frequency of a gyrotron is determined by the magnetic field and  not by the size of the fast-wave structure, the structure can be large, and it is then  possible to generate quite high power at millimeter-wave frequencies. <EOS>

<BOS> To a good approximation,  when a target of interest is above the optical horizon of an HFSWR, the field inci - dent on the target can be decomposed into terms that correspond to (i) direct line-of- sight, (ii) sea-surface reflection, and (iii) a lateral or “surface-attached” wave. <EOS>

<BOS> There is some evidence that sea clutter might  drop off more sharply below a critical angle  in the neighborhood of a degree or so.4  This critical angle, or critical range  for a radar at a fixed height, has been observed  from time to time since first noted in early observations of sea clutter.1 The critical  angle has been ascribed to interference between direct and (perfectly) reflected rays at  the scattering targets  responsible for the clutter signal, although these targets remain  unspecified.46 Although this simple picture could produce the R–7 decay that is some - times observed, a critical angle often fails to materialize, and when it does, it need  not show an R–7 decrease with range (equivalent to a fourth-power dependence on  grazing angle).1 An alternative explanation for this behavior, applicable at the higher  microwave frequencies, has been suggested based on a threshold-shadowing  model  for upwind and downwind directions.12,47 This model implies a sharp decrease in the  average cross section for grazing angles below a few degrees. <EOS>

<BOS> In the years since these early measurements, there has been considerable  activity in the field of HF radar and HF clutter,52,53 and the results can be sum - marized as follows: For vertical polarization, the major energy of the HF clutter  signal appears in spectral lines displaced to either side of the carrier frequency by  the frequency of sea waves having a wavelength equal to half the HF wavelength l  (in meters). <EOS>
<BOS> • Coherent integration times may extend to hundreds of seconds, as HFSWR is not  reliant on the ionosphere as a medium for propagation. <EOS>
<BOS> The range-tracking portion of the radar has the  advantage of seeing all targets within the beam from close range out to the maximum  range of the radar. <EOS>
<BOS> In general radar systems (apart from SAR), to achieve an  acceptable plan resolution requires a high gain antenna. <EOS>
<BOS> Because the simulated  signal is predominately entering the radar through the sidelobes of the radar antenna— except when the radar main beam aligns with the simulator antenna—the synthesized  signal needs to be automatically adjusted in amplitude to compensate for the actual  sidelobe sensitivity in the direction of the simulator. <EOS>
<BOS> This means that sidelobe clutter appears at  roughly the same doppler shift as main beam clutter and doppler filtering can be used effectively for detecting  targets usually without special need to reject the sidelobe clutter spatially. <EOS>
<BOS> The most versatile beamform - ing techniques rely on having a receiver for each array element, but as the number of  elements may approach 500, the cost of such a solution may be prohibitive. <EOS>
<BOS> Coherent beacons (which receive, amplify, and transmit received radar  pulses) can provide a doppler-shifted response free of target-caused spectral spread  and periodic modulations. <EOS>
<BOS> Other phase shifters use a single toroid and a single  driver.94,95 In this configuration, the phase shifter is latched on a minor hysteresis loop  by only partially magnetizing the ferrite. <EOS>

<BOS> The Dicke-Fix  receiver counters high rates of swept-frequency CW jamming and swept spot noise jam - mers.29,139 In a radar receiver, the Dicke-Fix uses a wideband intermediate-frequency  (IF) amplifier and a limiter ahead of the narrow-bandwidth IF amplifier. <EOS>
